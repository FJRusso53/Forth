from the moment i saw you i wanted to meet you
from the moment i met you i wanted to know you
from the moment i knew you i was in love with you
from the moment i loved you i wanted to share my life with you
and from that moment to this moment
and for all the moments to come
i will love you with all my heart
good morning things do not look good
trouble around all corners keeping low profile
need advice trash out of options
awaiting relief to come soon i hope
thank you for your effort to push the envelope and perform at such levels
we have a real mess on our hands
supplies at low level
time 0800 date february 08 2018
to the one i love
somewhere between the places we need to be
and all the things we need to do
are those precious times together that belong to just the two of us
and even though those times do not happen as often as either of us would like
just thinking about being alone with you again
helps me get through our extra busy days
even when life gets in the way of my showing you
i hope you always know how much i love you
happy happy wednesday my love
end of message
