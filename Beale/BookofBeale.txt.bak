evening prayer 
o my god 
at the end of this day i thank 
you most heartly for all the graces 
i have received from you 
i am sorry that i have not made better use of them 
i am sorry for all the sins i have committed against you 
forgive me o my god and graciously protect me this night

seeds of success 

god thank you for this day 
know have not accomplished as yet all you expect of me and if that is your reason for bathing me in the fresh dew of another dawn am most grateful 
am prepared at last to make you proud of me 
will forget yesterday with all its trials and tribulations aggravations and setbacks angers and frustrations the past is already dream from which can neither 
retrieve single word nor erase any foolish deeds 
will resolve however that if have injured anyone yesterday through my thoughtlessness will not let this day’ sun set before make amends and nothing do today 
will be of greater importance 
will not fret the future my success and happiness does not depend on straining to see what lurks dimly on the horizon but to do this day what lies clearly at hand 
will treasure this day for it is all have know that its rushing hours cannot be accumulated or stored like precious grain for future use 
will live as all good actors do when they are onstage only in the moment cannot perform at my best today by regretting my previous act mistakes or 
worrying about the scene to come 
will embrace today difficult tasks take off my coat and make dust in the world will remember that the busier am the less harm am apt to suffer the tastier will 
be my food the sweeter my sleep and the better satisfied will be with my place in the world 
will free myself today from slavery to the clock and calendar although will plan this day in order to conserve my steps and energy will begin to measure my life in deeds not 
years in thoughts not seasons in feelings not figures on dial 
will remain aware of how little it takes to make this happy day never will pursue happiness because it is not goal just by product and there is no happiness in having or in 
getting only in giving 
will run from no danger might encounter today because am certain that nothing will happen to me that am not equipped to handle with your help just as any gem is 
polished by friction am certain to become more valuable through this day adversities and if you close one do or you always open another for me 
will live this day as if it were christmas will be giver of gifts and deliver to my enemies the gift of forgiveness my opponents tolerance my friends smile my 
children good example and every gift will be wrapped with unconditional love 
will waste not even precious second today in anger or hate or jealousy or selfishness know that the seeds sow will harvest because every action good or bad is 
always followed by an equal reaction will plant only good seeds this day 
will treat today as priceless violin one may draw harmony from it and another discord yet no one will blame the instrument life is the same and if play it 
correctly it will give forth beauty but if play it ignorantly it will produce ugliness 
will condition myself to look on every problem encounter today as no more than 
pebble in my shoe remember the pain so harsh could hardly walk and recall my surprise when removed my shoe and found only grain of sand 
will work convinced that nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm to do anything today that is truly worth doing must not stand back shivering and 
thinking of the cold and danger but jump in with gusto and scramble through as well as can 
will face the world with goals set for this day but they will be attainable ones not the vague impossible variety declared by those who make career of failure 
realize that you always try me with little first to see what would do with lot 
will never hide my talents if am silent am forgotten if do not advance will fall back if walk away from any challenge today my self esteem will be forever 
will keep smile on my face and in my heart even when it hurts today know that the world is looking glass and gives back to me the reflection of my own soul now 
understand the secret of correcting the attitude of others and that is to correct my own 
will turn away from any temptation today might cause me to break my word or that lose my self respect am positive that the more valuable than my only thing 
possess life is my honor will work this day with all my strength content in the knowledge that life does not consist of wallowing in the past or peering 
anxiously at the future it is appalling to contemplate the great number of painful steps by which one arrives at truth so old so obvious and so frequently 
expressed whatever it offers little or much my life is now 
will pause whenever am feeling sorry for myself today and remember that this is the only day have and must play it to the fullest what my part may signify in the 
great whole may not recognize but am here to play it and now is the time will count this day separate life will remember that those who have fewest regrets are 
those who take each moment as it comes for all that it is worth 

this is my day 
these are my seeds 
thank you god for this precious garden of time 

psalm 23 for the work place 

the lord is my real boss and shall not want 
he gives me peace when chaos is all around me 
he gently reminds me to pray and do all things without murmuring and complaining 
he reminds me that he is my source and not my job 
he restores my sanity everyday and guides my decisions that might honor him in all that do even though face an absurd amount of mails system crashes unrealistic 
deadlines budget cutbacks gossiping coworkers discriminating supervisors and an aging body that doesn cooperate every morning still will not stop for he is with 
me his presence his peace and his power will see me through he raises me up even when they fail to promote me he claims me as his own even when the company 
threatens to let me go his faithfulness and love are better than any bonus check 
his retirement plan beats every 401k there is when it all said and done 
i ' ll be working for him whole lot longer and for that bless his name 

patience

how balanced am in my relationships with others 
are there any relationships in my life that test my patience to the max why 
how well do balance between those things in my life that are the most pressing as distinct from those things that are the most important 
do have to get everything done immediately 
do really listen to others am careful or considerate when respond 
how well do deal with changes in my life 
how well do roll with the punches of everyday life 

our daily bread

you need patience to do god will and receive what he has promised hebrews 10 36 
it is difficult in an age where the delay of any gratification is looked on as an evil or at least an unfortunate impediment to the good life tremendous cultural 
forces urge us on to get what we want now and to postpone the consequences until later writes eugene kennedy in time for love 
wise men and women know that patience and suffering are essential characteristics of life itself it is no wonder that st paul put patience first in his 
description of love characteristics 

patience is the strength that is needed if relationships are to retain their vitality 

patience is the strength that is needed if relationships are to retain their vitality 
salesian spirituality stresses this truth in our relationships with god our neighbor and ourselves our journey to holiness requires patience it is core issue in 
surrendering our lives for purpose total change of priorities and motivation it is the readiness to die ourselves to give life to others it is the living out of 
the mystery of life in christ that is real religion 

patience is not laziness indifference nor lack of common sense true patience accepts not only the great and heavy trials that occasionally come our way but also 
the petty troubles and annoying accidents of every day this means being patient not

patience is not laziness indifference nor lack of common sense 

only in the face of great sickness but with minor annoyances that god sends or permits it means being patient with where god wills us to be patient with those 
with whom he has surrounded us patient with whatever circumstance he permits the final and most excellent lesson on patience writes st francis de sales is when 
patience with our neighbor becomes part of out hearts we are always anxious that others put up with our miseries and that they tolerate us yet the miseries and 
faults of our neighbors always seem so great and unsupportable 

we must be patient and little by little eliminate our unacceptable traits and control our emotions life is continual struggle between hope and fear god is always 
ready to help us never tire of fighting for your growth toward perfection the truly patient person is not whiner nor desires to be pitied by others during hard 
times 

salesian spirituality tells us to be patient with everyone but above all with ourselves don be disturbed about your imperfections and always have the courage to 
pick yourself up after fall there is no better way to growing toward perfection

salesian spirituality tells us to be patient with everyone but above all with ourselves 
in the spiritual life than to always be starting over again and again and never thinking we have done enough 

practicing patience in our ordinary lives will thrust our energies toward spiritual growth parent simple demonstration of gentle patient reprimand has far 
greater power in correcting child than rage and passion just remember that god demonstrates an incredible amount of patience with us 
in this life patience should be our daily bread 
accepting yourself

what was your dream for yourself when you were growing up 
have you achieved that or continued to work toward that dream 
if not what has changed 
are you willing to accept the fact that some of your dreams may go unfulfilled 
have you tried to the best of your ability to live life to the fullest 
what are the obstacles inside you and around you that make it difficult for you’re to love and accept yourself 
how might you eliminate or reduce these obstacles 

where you are in life

persevere in thoroughly conquering yourself in the small daily contradictions you receive make the bulk of your desires about this know that god wishes nothing 
of you at present but that busy not yourself then in doing anything else do not sow your desires in another garden but cultivate well your own do not desire not 
to be what you are but desire to be very well what you are occupy your thoughts in making that perfect and in bearing the crosses little or great which you will 
meet believe me this is the great truth and the least understood in spiritual conduct st francis de sales 

when we were growing up we were taught that we could become whatever we wanted to be most of us had dreams of becoming someone great and doing wonderful things 
for humanity but what we become is often nothing like our dreams still many of us continue to dream we are still waiting for opportunities to do something great 
for god and so are not satisfied with who we are or what we are doing now 

we continue to be concerned about our abilities our productivity and if we are keeping up with our neighbors 
what concerns us most is how we come across to others whether our efforts are great enough to be recognized by others or whether we can be just like someone else 
that we admire 
we worry about what we are not am not the leader in my community or am not the most patient or most generous person we are often not satisfied with who we are 
and overlook our gifts and strengths as insignificant or unimportant but st francis de sales reminds us 
busy not yourself then in doing anything else do not sow your desires in another’ garden but cultivate well your own 
how do we put this advice into practice in everyday life through prayer and reflection we can come to understand our own strengths and come to know that god will 
for us each day is great regardless of whether it affects nation or just one person 
in daily prayer call to mind at the beginning of the day what you expect to take place and how you can follow jesus through your actions examine your conscience 
at the end of the day to review how successful you ve been by keeping in mind what your goal is for this day and what gifts god gave you to share you can enjoy 
each moment because it will already be dedicated to god will 
it is freeing experience not to have to worry about what will the neighbors think as long as we follow in jesus footsteps this gives us the opportunity to be 
thankful for what talents god has given us stop and think about it by appreciating the very moment you ve shared laugh with loved one or taught child anew 
concept we thank god for our abilities and we thank god for who we are this is all god is asking of us jesus tells us that the seed sown on rich soil is the one 
who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields hundred or sixty or thirty fold mt 13 23 
we can best honor god swill by focusing on our talents accepting who we are and by being open to god by living in the present moment 

the talents and abilities god gives us for our use to accomplish the divine will at each moment in time is his gift to us by recognizing this and accepting it we 
can see more clearly god will for us and can better discern god swill in others lives we can best bear the fruit or use our talents by accepting who we are right 
now and being open to god who lives in each present moment 
temptations replace replacement nerve garden gardening gardener wear wearing wore divorce chill chilly orthopedic

what kinds of temptations do you most frequently encounter 
what strategies do you employ for resisting them 
what opposite virtues could you practice to counter these temptations 
do you have spiritual director confessor or friend who can support your efforts to resist temptation and practice virtue 

encountering and countering them

the salesian tradition identifies three steps that can lead to sin 
the sin great or small is suggested 
the person being tempted is either pleased or displeased with the suggestion 
the person either consents to the temptation or refuses it 
let us be clear being tempted is not in itself sinful temptations cannot make us displeasing to god unless we delight in them and / or consent to them counsels 
st francis de sales let the enemies of our salvation set before us their snares and allurements as much as they like let them remain always at the door of our 
hearts seeking entrance let them make as many proposals as they like as long as we are determined to take no pleasure in this we can never of fend god 
our first line of defense against temptations is to turn our attention from them but to do so gently calmly and simply st jane de chantal recommends that we pay 
no attention to them doing whatever is necessary to take our minds off them yourhods however forceful must reflect moderation 
this moderation is critical if we overreact to the presence of temptations we may actually reduce our ability to resist them losing our cool in the face of 
temptations merely increases our spiritual turmoil allowing satan to fish as it were in troubled waters 
strategies for countering specific temptation depend upon the size or nature of the temptation itself 
temptations cannot make us displeasing to god unless we delight in them and / or consent to them 
great temptations may resist our efforts to simply turn away from them in fact they may actually pursue us remedies for dealing with this type include 
unite yourself with the crucified christ 
speak of it with spiritual director confessor or trusted friend 
resolve to be as stubborn and determined as the temptation itself 
most of all do not look at the temptation nor argue with it keep your attention fixed on the lord 
what small temptations may lack in quality they more than make up it in quantity like small flies or gnats they buzz about our ears bite us on the nose or cheeks 
obscure our vision advice don waste time examining them simply brush them away or practice the opposite virtue word of caution small temptations can actually be 
more dangerous to our spiritual health in the long run precisely because they are so frequent and appear so insignificant people trying to grow in holiness may 
successfully resist great temptation only to be worn down and compromised by the multiple and insidious assaults of small ones 
all this talk of resisting temptations overlooks the other important insight of salesian spirituality temptations can

what small temptation may lack in quality they more than make up in quantity 

actually serve as reminders of our need for growth our need for good our need for god francis de sales tells us that the experience of temptation can bring us 
back to reality make us reflect
upon our frailty and cause us to have recourse more quickly to our creator 
when the voice of temptation speaks to you turn away the eyes of your mind cover the ears of your heart seek the love and strength of the god who created you who 
redeemed you who inspires you 
above all practice life of virtue there is no better remedy against temptation than to be otherwise occupied doing the work of the lord 
practice 
what is your understanding of perfection 
if you were perfect what would that look or feel like 
do you ever experience perfectionism 
which of the ways of being perfected in the salesian tradition are most attractive to you 
which one do you experience as most difficult 
which would be most helpful to you right now at this point in your life 

makes perfect 
be perfected as my heavenly father is perfect mt 48 
jesus calls each of us to be perfected that is to allow ourselves to be purified and transformed by the saving power of god love as well as to be sources of that 
saving power in the lives of our brothers and 
sisters in short we are to display in our own lives each in our own way the image and likeness of god in whose image we are created and in whose glory we are 
destined to share 
we need to be clear about what being perfected is as well as what it is 
not it is about the journey it is about cooperating with the grace of the holy spirit to allow the divine to permeate every sinew of our being it is about 
avoiding sin it is about practicing virtue it is about 
learning to be fully completely human in ways that give glory to god and give life to one another 
it is about living jesus 
it is not about perfectionism it is 
not about being without blemish it is not about living like angels it is not about destination 
salesian spirituality keeps perfection in perspective 
be realistic set goals for growing 
in perfection that are reasonable your imagination has formed an ideal of absolute perfection which is impossible to achieve francis de sales wrote to devout 
woman leaving you as it were heavy with child and 
unable to give birth to deeper level of the spiritual life 
use everyday means lofty paths are not always the most effective practice the ordinary virtues forbearance with others service to others humility gentleness of 
heart affability tolerance of our own 
imperfection and similar little virtues 
perfection requires that we name our imperfections dear imperfections francis de sales tells us they force us to acknowledge our misery give us practice in 
humility selflessness patience and watchfulness yet 
notwithstanding god looks at the honesty of our hearts and sees that it is perfect 
patience is the surest means of attaining perfection francis de sales claims 

be patient with everyone but above all with yourself 
mean don be disturbed about your imperfections and always have the courage to pick yourself up after fall 
be willing to begin as many times as it takes make fresh start each day there no better way of growing toward perfection in the spiritual life than to always be 
starting over again and never thinking that we 
have achieved it 
being perfected is not about being what think what should be no perfection is about knowing what god thinks should be and relying upon grace to make that happen 
according to god timetable not mine st jane de 
chantal admonishes us 

try to perform all your actions calmly and gently 
keep your mind ever joyful peaceful and content 

do not worry about your perfection or about your soul god to whom it is and to whom you should completely entrust it will take care of it and fill it with 
all the graces consolations and blessings of 
divine love in the measure that they will be useful in this life in the next life god will grant you eternal bliss 

keep being perfect in perspective it is about transformation in this life it is about glory in the next in short how do we become perfect it may be surprisingly 
similar to the advise given to folks who one day 
hope to make it big on broadway practice practice practice 
that right practice makes perfect 
 
readily frequently diligently 

how might the salesian notion of devotion be new to you 
what aspect of salesian devotion do your find the most attractive or encouraging 
what aspect of salesian devotion do you find the most confrontational or challenging 
where do you experience the most success in living devout life 
where do you experience the most difficulty or frustration in living devout life 
where do you go from here 

the practice of devotion

we are called to live devout life 
sounds lofty doesn it seems unrealistic doesn it maybe that because we don understand the true meaning of devotion 

true living devotion says st francis de sales is nothing else than the love of god 

inasmuch as divine love adorns the soul it is called grace inasmuch as it gives us the strength to do what is good it is called charity inasmuch as it not only 
makes us do what is good but helps us to do so 
diligently frequently and readily it is called devotion 
in short devotion is the habit of doing what is good in the eyes of god with as much diligence frequency and passion as possible simple straightforward and well 
within our reach 
with the help of god 

this devotion is not for chosen few it is meant for everyone to be practiced in ways appropriate to our particular walk state or stage of life st francis de 
sales maintains in the creation god commanded the 
plants to bring forth their fruits each one after its kind so does god command all christians who are living plants of the church to bring forth the fruits of 
devotion each according to one character and 
vocation 

devotion is about striving to integrate the two greatest commandments the love of god and the love of neighbor 

consideration of what devotion is not may be just as valuable person addicted to fasting may think himself very devout when he fasts though his heart at the same 
time is filled with rancor he scruples to 
moisten his tongue with wine or even with water because of his sobriety but he makes no difficulty of drinking deep of another blood by detraction and slander 
another person considers herself devout because 
she recites daily multiplicity of prayers although immediately afterwards she utters the most disagreeable arrogant and injurious words in her home and among her 
neighbors still another draws alms out of his 
purse to give to the poor but cannot draw meekness out of his heart to forgive his enemies people such as these are commonly perceived as devout while in fact 
they are not 

devotion is not something merely worn for others to admire many persons make the world think they are truly devout by covering themselves with certain external 
actions that are associated with devotion in 
truth these are nothing but images and phantoms of devotion 

authentic devotion is striving to integrate the internal and external authentic devotion is striving to integrate the love of god with the love of neighbor 

authentic devotion if you will is about talking the talk and walking the walk 

devotion is about being real st jane de chantal writes try to make your devotion generous noble straightforward and sincere try to foster this same spirit in 
those with whom you come in contact spirit founded 
upon deep humility which results in sincere obedience sweet charity which supports and excuses all and an innocent guileless simplicity that makes us even 
tempered and friendly toward everyone 

now that devotion worth practicing 
 
just kidding 
how often do you laugh every day 
do you usually laugh only at others foibles and mistakes or do you laugh at yourself as well 
are you able to bring humor into 
your spiritual life 
when you recognize your weaknesses and failings can you allow god to run the show 
can you see surrender to god as spiritual value in your life 
can you enjoy the fact that both you and your neighbors are simply fallible but loving human beings 

or is it 
sense of humor keen enough to show man his own absurdities as well as those of other people will keep him from the commission of all sins or nearly all samuel butler 
humor is an affirmation of dignity declaration of man superiority to all that befalls him romain gary 
he is not laughed at who laughs at himself first thomas fuller 
no man who has once heartily and wholly laughed can be altogether irreclaimably bad thomas carlyle 
the most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed chamfort 
humor in general and laughter in particular are not only healthy and fun but can actually promote healing perhaps that why the most popular section in reader 
digest continues to be laughter the best medicine 
st francis de sales in the 17th century was one of the first spiritual writers to recognize the great value of humor he saw it from special vantage point he 
reasoned that in order to become the best people 
that we can be we would have to get to know ourselves very well in order to know ourselves very well we would have to study and accept not only our good points 
but especially those aspects of our nature which 
are defective our failings our faults our shortcomings 
when we recognize our defects our imperfections we realize that we have only two options we can cry about them or we can laugh at them crying about them is fine 
but we have to go beyond that we have to get to 
the point that we actually love the fact that we make mistakes and do foolish and stupid things because then we can accept the fact that we are not in control of all that
humor simultaneously wounds and 
heals indicts and pardons diminishes and enlarges it constitutes inner growth at the expense of outer gain and those who possess and honestly practice it make 
themselves more through willingness to make themselves less louis kronenberger 
happens in our lives we have to accept the fact that god is in control and we then can move to discover his will and surrender to it 
st francis de sales would have us develop the holy virtue of eutrepelia this is name he borrowed from the greek it simply means laughing at ourselves but it is 
practiced in special way it is done by telling stories about ourselves to our friends and family members 
we all do dumb things some days we do quite few if we get overly upset about these mistakes it can lead to anxiety and insecurity if however we put it all into 
perspective we realize that we are not the 
perfect people we would always prefer to be and that we have to depend on god to get us through in telling these stories we also allow others to see how human we 
are we are not the totally in control people we 
sometimes appear to be we do not see ourselves as better than others and we don want to lord it over others this also encourages others to share the funny and 
sometimes stupid things they have said and done we can all laugh at our weaknesses and appreciate the same in 
despising mocking or scoffing at our neighbor is an exceedingly great sin francis de sales others it can be powerful way of being free of letting go 
however the practice of this charitable kidding can quickly become something far less noble when we aren feeling so good about ourselves in times like these we 
are tempted to point out others faults in 
sarcastic or vicious manner simply to make ourselves look better when this becomes the motive we have lost the value and simple joy of eutrepelia such laughter 
or humor is no longer medicinal rather it becomes something derisive and poisonous 
the ability to kid with ourselves and one another is like atomic energy it can be an instrument of healing it can also be source of great pain may god help us to 
use this power wisely

how do deal with life difficulties 
am angry or resentful do cling to hurts and disappointments long after should have let them go 
am half empty or half full person do avoid tough times in life at the risk of also missing its joys 
what do need to learn at calvary at this point in my life what might need to bring to the cross of christ calvary 
life is difficult this is great truth one of the greatest truths it is great truth because once we truly accept this truth we transcend it once we truly know 
that life is difficult once we truly understand 
and accept it then life is no longer difficult because once it is accepted the fact that life is difficult no longer matters 
so says scott peck in his book the road less traveled so say all christians who reflect upon the image that sums up the life and love of christ 
calvary he embraced life and each person in it fully openly and jesus did not love to suffer jesus suffered because he loved honestly he did not avoid life some 
times complex challenging and messy nature jesus came to redeem all of creation not just the pleasant joyous and light hearted parts 
such is the world of relationships such is the world of life such is the world of love 
jesus had his share of heartache he experience rejection he experienced disappointment he experienced frustration he experienced humiliation he experienced loss 
ultimately he experienced death the temptation 
to avoid life challenges to turn away from opportunities for growth that can be found in grief to choose to withdraw from the world to choose to withdraw from 
oneself scott peck still jesus never allowed this 
dimension of life to obscure his vision of power and promise for all those who struggle to know and carry out even in the face of hardships the will of god each 
day 
as tough as life can be sometimes we only make things worse when we try to avoid life difficulties at any / all costs the truth is straightforward if we want to 
enjoy life roses we must we willing to accept our 
share of its thorns where do we learn to find opportunities for love even in the face of life painful realities francis points us to calvary the school of lovers 
all love that does not take its origin from the 
savior passion is foolish and perilous unhappy is death without the savior love unhappy is love without the savior death love and death are so mingled in the 
savior passion that we cannot have one in our hearts without the other 
this is not being maudlin this is being real and if true love is nothing else it must be real this world is all about the continuing confluence of success and 
surrender of embracing and letting go of life and death 
st jane de chantal encourages us to calm your passions and inclinations and live according to sound reason and the holy will of god otherwise will always be 
anxious and perturbed but if you are fortunate 
enough to accept the difficulties of this life which god sends to those he loves for their growth and progress toward blessedness then even in this life you will 
begin to get little taste of the delights of glorious eternity 
however we need to be sure that the calvary we embrace is that of christ not calvary of our own making we sometimes fashion crosses of our own when we fail to 
deal with life challenges in may god in all compassion grant us the grace to embrace life difficulties 
humble gentle patient and trusting manner such crosses are not means for salvation as much as sources for our own misery st jane once noted to member of her 
visitation community must you continue to be your 
own cross can see that no matter which way god leads you you change everything into bitterness and trouble brooding over everything 
be certain that the sufferings with which you bear are opportunities to follow god will as distinct from the sufferings that come from your attempts to push your 
will on god and others 

may god in all compassion grant us the grace to embrace the difficulties we sometimes encounter when we attempt to follow the will of god in so doing may we 
likewise experience something of the glory of god promised to all who enroll in the school of love win / win

stephen covey in his national bestseller seven habits of highly effective people reminds us that whether you are the president or the janitor the moment you step 
from independence in interdependence in any capacity you step into leadership role and the habit of effective leader ship is win / win 
the author suggests that this framework is not technique but way of 
most people tend to think in terms of the world divided into two groups winners and losers the haves and have nots 
life that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions 
for many in our contemporary culture this approach is an unrealistic philosophy to swallow most people tend to think in terms of the world divided into two 
groups winners and losers the haves and the have nots 
recent slogan discovered on bumper sticker brought this home loud and clear if you can run with the big dogs you better stay on the porch as far back as cain and 
abel it seems as if humankind has had to translate relationships in terms of the accepted and rejected winners and losers 
the spiritual journey is not exempt 
from the struggle one doesn have to look any further than the occupants around the passover table on the night that jesus gave himself to his followers as the 
bread of life and the cup of salvation before 
they were rudely interrupted by the lord the apostles were arguing about who should be regarded as the greatest 
stephen covey is right when he tells us that the win / lose approach to be fair in all your actions always put yourself in your neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours 
life is seriously flawed in fact four centuries earlier another keenly perceptive gentleman counseled be fair in all your actions always put yourself in your 
neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours then 
you will judge fairly imagine yourself the seller when buying and the buyer when selling then you will buy and sell fairly 

the author of this sentiment saint francis de sales reminds us in his spiritual approach to life that we must draw one another attention to the fact that each of 
us is made in god image and likeness and the 
measure of our love for god rests in the perfection of our love for our neighbor 
some believe that everything outside of their self interest doesn matter the contrary is true anything less than striving for goals that benefit all is settling 
for second best as best in world that is growing 
intensely interdependent in an environment where we profess to be children of the same god win / win is the only viable option covey notes that in relationships 
like marriage for instance if both are people aren winning then both are 
francis de sales cautions that an individual is never do dead as when he or she lives for self alone 
losing in the same vein francis de sales cautions that an individual is never so dead as when he or she lives for self alone 
paul john has challenged us in his writings on solidarity to embrace an attitude that fosters firm and enduring determination to commit oneself to the common 
good because we truly are responsible for one 
another he challenges us in real sense to win / win approach to life and relationships jesus died in order that we might win all of us for heaven let do our level 
best to make that promise reality heart 

what is my understanding of humility is it healthy or harmful 
am truly gentle with myself 
am truly gentle with others 
am willing to put myself in another shoes 
how generous am in my dealings with others 
am tough on others but lax on myself 
what is my notion of being just person 
are there areas in my life in which need to seek justice for myself or others 

for justice 
st francis de sales is best known for the practice of two virtues humility and gentleness 
humility might be described as 
living in the truth the truth is that we are created in god image and likeness the trust is that we are good the truth is that we do not always live up to that 
goodness the truth is that we need god 
forgiveness and grace to make that goodness real the truth is that we need the support and encouragement of one another 
gentleness might be described as the practice of proportionality it is about keeping things in perspective it is 
about knowing when to stand firm it is about knowing when to give ground 
most of all whether in good times tough times or in all the times in between gentleness is about relating to ourselves and others with profound respect 
graciousness rooted in the recognition that each of us all of us are sons and daughters of the living god 
in short being humble and gentle is about trying to embody the words of jesus found in st matthew gospel come to me all you who are weary and find life 
burdensome and will refresh you learn from me for am gentle and humble of heart 
the daily practice of these two virtues fashions particular kind of heart in those who follow jesus heart that longs and strives for justice 
be just and equitable in all your actions wrote st francis de sales in part three chapter 36 of the introduction to the devout life 
always put yourself in your neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours and then you will judge rightly 

he continued imagine yourself the seller when you are buying imagine yourself the buyer when you are selling in this way you will sell and buy according to 
justice 
this is not always easy to do we are frequently tempted to relate to others in ways that are not just that are not reasonable we are tempted to promote only our 
own concerns to first ask what in it for me or to always be concerned about taking care of number one 
at times like these we have two hearts one heart is mild favorable and courteous toward ourselves the other is hard severe and rigorous toward our neighbor at 
times like these we have two balances the one to 
weigh out conveniences to our own greatest advantages and the other to weigh those of our neighbor to their greatest possible disadvantage 
humble gentle people frequently check to see if they relate to others reasonably humble gentle people frequently check to see if their hearts truly strive for justice 
st francis de sales challenges us do not neglect to frequently examine whether your heart be such with respect to your neighbor as you would desire your neighbor 
to be with respect to you were you in the other situation such an ordinary thing such and walk humbly relate gently live justly love generously 
everyday thing in the salesian tradition such powerful life giving thing in the end claims st francis de sales we lose nothing by living generously nobly 
courteously and with royal just and reasonable heart 
not only do we lose nothing but in the eyes of god we gain everything place in god heart forever in heaven place in god plan for salvation now here on earth 
walk humbly relate gently live justly love generously in ways great and small strive to follow the example of the gentleman saint follower of christ who 
challenges us embody the heart of jesus to embody the heart of justice sense of civility 

how do deal with conflict in my life 
do fight fair when confronted with disagreements grace builds on nature do treat others in polite civil manner 
life seldom provides big opportunities to respect others do make use of the countless opportunities to practice simple ordinary acts of kindness every day 
in what area of my life could use the healing touch of civility from others 

salesian hallmark 
scott peck claims something is seriously wrong with our society in his book entitled world waiting to be born bantam 1993 the author identifies what he believes 
is corrosive cancer that threatens our families 
schools workplaces communities and social institutions an epidemic of incivility 
it seems that wherever we look people are locked in combat whether in rancorous debate on the floor of the house of representatives rush hour obscenities 
exchanged in traffic the rise of teenage violence or 
the antics of daytime television we appear to be losing the ability to treat one another in civil manner 
courtesy politeness and respect are retreating to take no prisoners approach to personal familial or political competition and conflict 
what is the remedy to this state of affairs first we need to constantly remind ourselves that god created us out of love second we need to constantly remember 
that every person we encounter possesses god given 
dignity and worth third we need to demonstrate these truths by treating one another in respectful civil manner st francis de sales 1567 1622 is model of civility 
although he witnessed and experienced 
tremendous turmoil during his lifetime he is celebrated for his unwavering attempts to treat others with profound respect good manners and kind demeanor even in 
the midst of conflict this quality later earned 
him the title of the gentleman saint whose feast day is observed on january 24 
he believed that jesus command to love one another is most frequently demonstrated by our practice of civility 
he believed that jesus command to love one another is most frequently demonstrated by the practice of civility relating to our parents spouses children co 
workers friends even enemies in just and hospitable manner 
st francis de sales advice for promoting civility in families schools communities and social structures is just as powerful and practical in our own day as it 
was nearly 400 years ago the single best source 
for his down to earth wisdom can be found in his introduction to the devout life first published in 1608 just sampling of his guidance and encouragement include 
while it is important to resist evil and address the faults of others we must do so gently and peacefully 
when you encounter difficulties and contradictions do not try to break them rather bend them with gentleness and time yea 
you can attract more flies with teaspoon of honey than with barrel of vinegar 
 
the roots for civility means members of household we are members of the household of god citizens with the saints who are called to live jesus to build the city 
of god here on earth even as we our commitment to relate with
one another in respectful just and loving ways can be powerful remedy indeed for world increasingly threatened by hostility rancor and violence 
 
anticipate our everlasting home in heaven 
our commitment to relate with one another in respectful just and loving ways can be powerful remedy indeed for world increasingly threatened by hostility rancor 
and violence blessed are we to have st francis 
de sales as our companion and guide as we attempt to walk on the way with our brothers and sisters gently peacefully and amiably each and every day 
may god help us to recognize that civility is one of the strongest foundations for the practice of charity hearing god word 

is my mind so distracted that have difficulty in remaining attentive to the word of god 
what impact does the word of god have in my life how well do prepare to receive the word of god 
what are some ways that can take the message to serve and love the lord have taken the good news to others 
where am most in need of the healing power of god word in my life at this time 

and keeping it 

blessed are those who hear the word of god and observe it luke 11 28 
we hold up the lectionary of biblical texts in the procession that opens the celebration of the eucharist incense it before reading it on solemn occasions and 
preface the gospel reading with an ‘alleluia this 
is no ordinary book indeed all these words and actions indicate what respect we have for the text and what hopes we have from reading and interpreting it writes 
lawrence cunningham much has happened to scripture reading since the l7th century of st 
francis de sales the thirst for christian direction through prayerful scripture study listening and sharing by laymen and women is norm of the 21st century the 
bible library of books is god word in unique way 
that is not true of any other human composition the second vatican council states that the church serves the word of god and pays reverence to it 
it is most interesting to read the words of st francis de sales some four hundred years ago concerning scripture 
be devoted to the word of god whether you hear it in familiar conversations with spiritual friends or sermons always listen to it with attention and reverence 
make good use of it do not let it fall to earth but take it into your heart 
we must prepare ourselves to hear the word with the attention it deserves not as it if were just any other word 
we must open our hearts in the presence of the divine majesty receptive to his heavenly dew 
when we hear the word of god in preaching or when we read it in book 
let us spiritually place it on our heads in obedience let us submit ourselves to the things that are taught us concerning god will for our perfection and 
spiritual advancement 
receive the word in spirit of humility devotion and reverence hear it with attention 
his message emphasizes preparation and action when we hear the word of god how do we do this reverence to listen with trust is to
accept the father word the scriptures are not so much source of information as word that demands response the bible is not read to satisfy curiosity but to 
uncover call from god and requires our response if we 
accept it it changes us outright rejection results in what st jerome said ignorance of scripture is ignorance of god 

preparation begin by studying sunday scripture readings our church has blessed us with structured cycle system that provides an opportunity to read over eighty 
percent of the bible use it prepare to hear the expected and unexpected 

attentiveness concentrate on really hearing the word to listen is to be alert to what the spirit is saying to the world today limit distractions by being prepared 

we each bring to the mass variety of experiences and perspectives concerning the scripture reading st francis de sales would want us to strive to be serious 
christians who take the inexhaustible richness of 
the word seriously reverently and apply it to our lives in spirit of devotion and attention he suggests that we hear and understand the scripture truths the same 
as we seek perfection in all our spiritual practices 

be kind to yourself as you struggle with finding the time or place for preparation remember the presence of god is in the word remember the presence and action 
of the word in all creation remember most of all our call to be god word in the lives of one another 
 
decisions decisions 

discernment must lead to choice to action do your choices 
help you to practice virtue 
enable you to be faithful to your state or stage in life 
increase your sense of peace 
deepen your experience of joy 
enrich the lives of others 
respect the needs of others 
make you better listener 
help you to do what is good right and just in the eyes of god 

discerning the will of god what does god want me to do 
this question simply put is at the heart of discernment this question is also at the heart of the salesian tradition discernment presumes at least four things 
god exists 
god is near to me 
god has will or desire for me 
can come to know god will 
the salesian tradition describes discernment as the experience of living between the two wills of god 
god signified will is that which god is communicating in general through the commandments and counsels found in scripture the authority and teaching of the 
church the lived experience and tradition of the 
christian faithful the inspiration of the spirit the duties of one state or vocation in life 
for example if you are married and raising family god signified will for you would include such things as living life of virtue honoring your father and mother 
keeping the holy the sabbath believing that 
christ is truly present in the eucharist nourishing your relationship with your spouse raising your children in the faith being good parent 
god signified will in particular may also be expressed through the actual circumstances in life over which you have no control you are on your way to an 
important meeting and you get flat tire you are 
preparing to leave work when co worker needs your help you are watching tv and your child asks you to review homework assignment all of these invite you to ask 
what is really important here 
god permissive will involves those things over which you do have control or influence is today the day you confront co worker about an earlier dispute do you 
accept or decline that promotion what do your 
children need from you at this moment should you put your parent in nursing home 
where is your relationship with your spouse most in need of attention should you make time to perform volunteer work how should you invest your money 
discernment is the process of being open to how god permissive will is inviting you to live out god signified will in ways that are appropriate ~ and even 
required by the circumstances relationships and events 
in which you find yourself 
put another way discernment is about choosing how best to follow
god will desires and longings for you now today this moment what is the best or what are some better ways of imitating the example of christ in this particular 
moment circumstance or event no matter how 
serious or commonplace 
how do you know what is better or best 
develop the ability to listen develop the ability to filter out the external and internal static of your life recognize that the most pressing things are not 
always the most important realize too that the most 
important things must sometimes wait for the most pressing 
focus on how god may be speaking through your family friends or co workers pay attention to the demands and responsibilities of your state and stage in life both 
the planned and the unexpected personal prayer 
the reading of scripture celebrating the eucharist employing the assistance of spiritual director and experiencing the sacrament of reconciliation can help you 
to sharpen your hearing 
discernment never occurs in vacuum it always takes place within the context of your relationships with god yourself others and the created order in which you 
live turn to trusted friends who can support your 
attempts to do what is right in the eyes of god 
turn to your personal history too learn from past successes learn from past mistakes 
above all regardless of the ease or difficulty with which you discern god will place your confidence and trust in god presence even when you can see hear or feel 
god voice the
spirit is with you 
ask god for the grace and courage to discern wisely every day

divine providence

am aware of god presence in my life at this very moment 
in what ways do see god love manifest in family friends and community 
can recognize that peaceful response to the changes of life encourages more growth 
can hear the voice of god in the words of friends 
how well do relate to the words of the our father 
does this prayer help me to recognize my need for nourishment forgiveness and protection from evil 

and god loving care
do not think about what will happen tomorrow for the same eternal father who takes care of you today will look out for you tomorrow and always thus st francis de sales admonishes us with typically reassuring 
words to trust in divine providence at precisely the point where it most directly touches our lives the present 
de sales presents this constant care of the lord as it truly is real contact between god ever present care arid our daily lives 
st jane de chantal observes 
herein lies our excellence to see the loving will of god in all things and to follow it salesian spirituality challenges us to see taste and hear this di vine providence precisely where we are 
recent books on prayer have centered on listening to god but most of us find it difficult to hear the message this is because the source of the answer may be the words or actions of friend or colleague 
let us consider more directly some of the varied ways in which st francis de sales drives home the message of the real presence of god love in his perpetual care for each of us 
one way of doing this may be by recognizing the opportunity others present for our recognition of his message for us live entirely for god and since you have to take part in conversations and 
social gatherings are a mess 
try to be of some use to others it is precisely in these gatherings that moments of care trust and compassion can elevate ordinary experiences 
second recognize the father love in ordinary events so too if you gather and manage the goods of this world with one hand you must always hold fast to your heavenly father hand with the other 

when we cooperate with god will our lives become more not less free 

third trust in god care be at peace since you are one of god children and let your restless weary heart rest against the sacred loving breast of the savior who by his gentle tender love is mother to them this 
loving father / mother is the very description of unconditional love so vital to healthy personality 
fourth stay centered don let anxiety take control of your heart you have passed through number of trials by the grace of god the same grace will be there for you in all the occasions to 
come most therapists make a mess 
rely on just such advice to assist clients to work through problems using the skills of experience 

st jane de chantal offers beautiful image for being open to divine providence we should keep ourselves in the good hands of this great god like cloth in the hands of tailor who cuts it in hundred different 
ways for use as the tailor pleases and designs 

how much more so does providence provide for navigating rough paths 

so too we should allow the powerful hand of god to cut hammer and chisel us just as divine providence wishes so as to make us fitting stone for the adornment of god edifice which is life and love 

if we were to forget all of these things francis advises in his letters keep this maxim in mind god is our father because if he were not jesus would not have commanded us to say our father what have you to 
fear if you are children of such father without whose providence not even one hair of our head would fall 
 
reasoned not rash
how do perceive other people 
am reasonable in my judgments 
what are the circumstances in which am tempted to judge rashly 
are there particular people in my life at home in the neighborhood or on the job whom am more inclined to judge rashly than others who are they why do judge them this way 
what might my experience of rash judgment tell me about the condition of my own mind heart or soul 
what steps can take to reduce my tendency or temptation to judge others rashly 
how might need to judge more reasonably

judging one another
have you ever made snap judgment about someone else have you ever gone with first impression about someone else and never move beyond it have you ever spent 
great deal of time imagining or even obsessing about 
someone else motives have you ever found yourself presuming the worst about someone else 
if you have done one or more you may have been guilty of rash judgment 
st francis de sales has pretty low tolerance for the practice of judging others rashly in his introduction to the devout life he wrote how offensive to god is 
rash judgment it is kind of spiritual jaundice 
that causes all things to appear evil to the eyes of those people infected with it rash judgment begets uneasiness contempt of neighbor pride self satisfaction 
and many other extremely bad effects 
why do we judge others rashly francis believed that people who have drunk in pride envy ambition and hatred think that everything they see is evil and 
reprehensible 
francis suggests that there are number of interior qualities that tempt us to judge others rashly naturally sour or negative personality arrogant or presumptuous 
attitudes trying to make oneself feel better at the expense of others desire to flatter and excuse oneself by finding someone else who appears worse an attempt 
to make oneself seem more intelligent or together strong personal dislike jealousy fear ambition and other mental weaknesses 
what is the ultimate goal of rash judgment 
to draw conclusion from an action in order to condemn the other person 
god judgment is so different from ours wrote st jane de chantal god never judges rashly god judgments are fair clear patient and long suffering god judges not 
with an eye to condemn but with the hope of calling us back of making us whole of setting us right of offering us the power of reconciliation of extending to us 
the promise of eternal life and love 
god judgments are not rooted in suspicion or speculation god judgments are rooted in the truth 
what steps can we take to cure ourselves of the disease of rash judgment whoever wants to be cured must apply remedies not to the eyes or intellect but to the 
affections drink as deeply as you can of the sacred wine of charity wrote francis de sales charity will set you free from the perverse moods that cause you to 
make such tortured judgments since charity is fearful of meeting evil charity never looks for evil 
he continued imagine yourself the seller when you are buying imagine yourself the buyer when you are selling in this way you will sell and buy according to 
justice 
does this mean we should be blind to the actual evil sins or imperfections that may exist in others no it is permissible to doubt or suspect in the strict 
sense and as far as proof and arguments compel us to do so 

the key is to address any actual or perceived issues or conflicts as simply and quickly as possible and then move on learn and let go rather than brood over or 
harbor them in our hearts 

to be like god to live like jesus to love like the spirit we must judge one another in ways that are reasonable and righteous base judgment on fact not fiction 
in sensitivity not suspicion on behavior not bias in faith not fear 

francis de sales wrote if your affections are kind your judgments will be likewise 
what do our judgments of others say about the condition of our hearts 
 
anxious 
what are the things the people the situations in my life about which am anxious 
what is the good for which hope what are the difficulties about which fear 
how do my anxieties manifest themselves 
what are some practical concrete steps can take to reduce my anxieties 
what are some practical concrete steps can take to achieve good or to deal with my difficulties 
do pray to god about the source of my anxiety and mess 
is there someone friend colleague professional with whom can process the source of my anxiety 
once ve done all that can how good am at letting go 

don ' t be 
have you ever worried about the future the destiny of son or daughter outliving your retirement investments or caring for an aging disabled parent have you ever 
worried about the past regretted decisions 
broken relationships or unfulfilled dreams 
have you ever had the experience of being worried about everything in general but nothing in particular 
if you said yes then you know what it means to be anxious 
 with the exception of sin anxiety is the greatest evil that can befall us 
to be sure there are many things in our lives that cause us to be anxious regrets about the past uncertainties about the future and everything in between but 
anxiety can be as bad or sometimes even worse than 
the things about which we were worried in the first place the american heritage dictionary of the english language houghton mifflin 1992 defines anxiety as state 
of intense apprehension uncertainty and fear 
resulting from threatening situation or event often to degree that the normal physical and psychological functioning of the affected individual is disrupted 
st francis de sales certainly knew the danger of anxiety in his introduction to the devout life 1609 he wrote anxiety is the greatest evil that can befall us sin 
excepted strong language he continued sedition 
and internal troubles ruin nation utterly and prevent it from being able to resist foreign invasion similarly when we are troubled and restless we lose our power 
to maintain the virtue that we have acquired we 
also lose the means of resisting the temptations of the enemy who then makes every effort to fish as they say in troubled waters 
anxiety not only hinders us from resisting evil it can also prevent us from achieving what is good 
how many first dates interviews for job promotion or efforts to win that big contract have gone up in smoke because of anxiety st francis de sales wrote 
anxiety arises from an inordinate desire to be freed from the evil we experience or to acquire the good for which we hope yet there is nothing which so 
aggravates the evil or impedes the good as anxiety and 
eager ness 
anxiety inordinate desire –is truly two edged sword since it is so much apart of
life how do we deal with it st jane de chantal was contemporary and friend of st francis de sales in her advice to woman who had recently been widowed st jane 
offered her remedy for anxiety try to calm your 
passions and inclinations and live according to the sound reason and the holy will of god otherwise you will always be anxious and perturbed 
st francis de sales wrote when you are taken up by desire to be delivered from some evil or to obtain some good place yourself above all in peace and tranquility 
compose your judgment and your will then quietly and gently pursue the object of your desire taking in order the means that are fitting and when say gently do 
not mean negligently but without eagerness 
confusion and anxiety other wise you will spoil every thing 
so when faced with some sin or setback to avoid or when striving to obtain some gift or good remain calm ask god for the presence of mind and heart to stay 
centered no matter how small or great the temptation 
to be anxious consider what god gives you the courage and ability to do on your own behalf consider too that which only god can accomplish 
perhaps st jane says it best what mean is that in all your good works you should unite yourself to the will of god good pleasure in all in your faults and 
imperfections you should unite yourself to god 
compassion gently quietly and with peace of mind 
half empty 

what are my fundamental beliefs about god 
what are my fundamental beliefs about others 
what are my fundamental beliefs about myself 
am half full or half empty person 
do focus on failure or do gravitate toward growth 
do see more of what is wrong in life or what is right 
what experiences in my past have brought me to this point in my present 
how might need to experience healing or grow in my practice of hope 
or half full 
am an optimist or pessimist is life generally pleasant for me or painful am basically happy or sad is the glass half full or is the glass half empty 
our answers to these questions and to others like them are important our fundamental beliefs and attitudes have tremendous impact on how we perceive life when we 
view life positively we tend to focus on what 
is right or good when we view life negatively we tend to focus on what is wrong or evil 
on any given day we usually see only what we choose to believe 
knowing whether we are half empty or half full people isn merely some exercise in rhetorical speculation no far from it ultimately such knowledge is matter of 
life and death 
our fundamental beliefs and attitudes have tremendous impact on how we perceive life 
volumes of research clearly indicate that people who are basically optimistic are much more effective and successful in dealing with the realities and challenges 
of life joyful painful and everything else in 
between than those people whose attitudes are basically pessimistic 
this is true in every dimension of life physical psychological emotional 
social and spiritual 
what does it mean to be an optimistic or half full person the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines optimism as tendency to expect the 
best possible outcome or dwell on the most helpful aspects of situation is your life a mess
francis de sales was clearly half full person in considering whether human beings are basically good or basically evil for example francis de sales had this to 
say consider the nature god has given us 
 as the cross of calvary starkly demonstrates sometimes being optimistic isn enough 
it is the highest in this visible world it is capable of eternal life and of being perfectly united to god divine majesty introduction to the devout life part 
one chapter the gentleman saint was not naive as 
thomas green cites in his book come down zacchaeus francis de sales recognized the tragedy of sin he acknowledged the allure of temptation he knew the 
experiences of suffering pain loss and injustice he saw 
the possibility of human fear and blindness that is why as green observed francis stressed the importance of good guide and of well balanced program of spiritual 
discipline 64 but more importantly francis 
proclaimed the greater truth of god creative power the greater reality of god redeeming love the greater possibility of god inspiring hope thomas green wrote god 
is truly here for those who have eyes to see 
for god everything is possible this is the faith foundation of the good sense and joyous hope so prominent in francis de sales ibid francis de sales certainly 
dwells on the most helpful aspects of the situation that we call life doesn he 
however as the cross of calvary starkly demonstrates sometimes optimism isn enough we need something deeper something more fundamental and something more 
enduring mess being optimistic is not the same as being naive 
half full / god filled people need hope perhaps the best definition of this virtue comes from vaclav ravel who while imprisoned in czech prison wrote hope is 
definitely not the same thing as optimism it is not 
the conviction that something will turn out well rather hope is the certainty that comes from the belief that things make sense that life is full of purpose 
regardless of the results 
half empty or half full devoid of meaning or full of purpose dragged down by what is wrong or encouraged by what is right

the virtue of hope 
what are the things for which you hope world peace promotion at work the lottery jackpot good health secure retirement an end to violence cure for cancer 
what do we do when we hope what does it really mean when we hope for something 
the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines hope as to wish for something with the expectation of fulfillment it defines the theological virtue of hope as 
the desire and search for future good difficult but not impossible to attain with god help 
from theological point of view there is much more to hope than mere wishful thinking 
in the opinion of st francis de sales we cannot fully understand the virtue of hope without also understanding the practice of aspiration 
in book two of his treatise on the love of god francis de sales distinguishes one from the other we hope for those things that we expect to gain through the aid of another whereas we aspire to those things 
that we expect to gain through our own resources and our own efforts chapter 17 
put different way we hope when we rely on others efforts for good things whereas we aspire when we rely on our own efforts simple example might be helpful to understand the relationship between hope and 
aspiration and how we need to practice both in order to attain the good things for which we desire 
we cannot fully understand hope without understanding aspiration 
my sister has son in first grade she desires as would any parent that each and every day of school is safe healthy and positive experience for him she aspires when she wakes him up in the morning she aspires 
when she helps him to get dressed she aspires when she makes him breakfast she aspires when she checks his backpack she aspires when she walks him to the bus stop she aspires when 
she gives him kiss and watches him board the bus she aspires as she waves goodbye mess 
as the bus pulls away my sister hopes she hopes that the driver completes the trip safely she hopes that her son teachers will do their very best she hopes that her son classmates will treat him with kindness 
and respect she hopes that her son does the same for others she hopes that the return bus trip will be as safe as the morning she hopes that her son remembers to bring home what he needs to prepare for tomorrow 
she aspires when she is there to greet the bus she aspires as she walks him home she aspires as she listens to him talk about all the wonderful things that happened that day in school she aspires as she cares 
for him during what remains of this day she hopes for another good day tomorrow 
of the relationship between these two practices francis wrote just as those who would try to hope without aspiring are cowardly and irresponsible so too those who try to aspire 
without hoping are rash insolent and presumptuous ibid mess 
as people of faith we hope when we know that the good things for which we wish depend on the grace of god and the good will of others as people of faith we aspire when we 
recognize that the good things for which we wish also depend on our own efforts 
 wisdom consists in knowing when to hope and when to aspire 
as people of faith wisdom consists of knowing when and how to hope when and how to aspire 
wish to win the lottery be sure to buy ticket wish for secure retirement be sure to plan now wish for good health be sure to see doctor regularly wish for world peace be sure to begin at home as for the 
outcome as people of faith we know that after we have aspired in our own regard and hoped with regard to others we must leave the ultimate results in the hands of god who loves us always poor in spirit 

on scale of one to ten how poor in spirit am do anxiously long or obsess about things that do not possess 
am inordinately concerned about losing the things that already do possess 
how do handle good fortune do keep it for myself or do share it with others 
on scale of one to ten how generous am in my dealings with others do trust god do trust others 
in what ways do need to better practice poverty of spirit 

rich in mind and heart 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes the first of which is blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs 
is the kingdom of god 
the placement of this beatitude before all others underscores the importance of the question what does it mean to be poor in spirit 
francis de sales offered this reflection on this first of the beatitudes in his introduction to the devout life 
whatever riches and all other transitory things you may possess you must keep your heart free from the slightest affection for them 
your heart may be surrounded by riches however riches must never master your heart 
the gentleman saint offers this practical image to explain this virtue there is difference between possessing poison and being poisoned pharmacists keep almost every kind of poison in stock for use in various 
situations yet they are not themselves poisoned because the poison is merely in their shops not in their bodies so too you can possess riches without being poisoned by them if you keep them in
your home your purse or your wallet but not in your heart 
failing to live spirit of poverty is like having fever francis suggested 
we can be sure that we are indeed suffering from this fever when we lovingly ardently and anxiously desire to possess goods that we do not have and when we are strongly attached to the goods that we already 
possess when we set our hearts on them always having them in our thoughts and fear losing them with strong anxious fear 
consider the parable of the rich fool in the gospel of luke 12 13 21 rich man with bumper crop has problem his barns cannot accommodate the yield his solution he plans to tear down his barns and build bigger 
ones that will hold all of his good fortune 
of course the only thing that surpasses this man wealth so goes the parable is his foolishness god takes his life that very night 
the rich man is not condemned because he had filled his barns with riches 
he is condemned because he had filled his heart with his riches he was so consumed and self absorbed with his good fortune that when he was trying to decide how to dispose of it he never considered simpler and 
more virtuous option to share it with others francis de sales puts it this way willingly grant that you may take care to increase your wealth and resources provided this is done not only justly but properly 
and charitably 
what does poverty of spirit look like francis offers this advice do not have full and explicit desire for wealth you do not have 

only increase your wealth justly properly and charitably 

do not set your heart deeply on what you already possess don grieve long over losses you incur then you will have some grounds to believe that although you may be rich in effect you are not such in affection 
poor and consequently blessed will you be because your greatest possession is the kingdom of god 

word to the wealthy and the wise the best way to avoid being anxious about getting what you want or losing what you have is to be generous to others therein lies the secret of the poor in spirit pursuing 
richness of mind and heart wealth that in the eyes of god enriches now and forever in the kingdom of god 
prayer yea 
am attentive to god invitation to pray throughout the day 
what do find are the best times for me to pray 
how do pray while am doing household tasks cleaning doing the laundry preparing meal 
what is the greatest challenge to prayer in the work environment time atmosphere stress what can do to meet these challenges of supplies 
what are some things that can do that will help me to seize every opportunity to pray 
for busy people 
with all prayer and supplication pray at 
every opportunity in the spirit eph 18 
prayer is the heart of our personal relationship with our god god continuous invitation of love to each of us which allows us to respond in prayer is an unfathomable gift given to us moment by moment 
many of us desire to grow into deeper loving relationship with god the question is how to integrate daily prayer into our busy often hectic schedules what does our salesian tradition say about praying at every 
opportunity 
they who wish to thrive and advance in the way of our lord should at the beginning of their actions both interior and exterior ask for his grace spiritual directory of st francis de sales 23 
an essential element in our daily prayer life is the awareness of god presence with us 
because we can easily get caught up in the nitty gritty of the day francis de sales recommends that as soon as we awaken we unite ourselves with god in loving praise and gratitude and offer to him in advance 
all that this new day may bring the opportunities for doing good as well as the difficulties which we may encounter feel rushed in the morning some practical suggestions from our salesian lay group that meets 
once week set your alarm few minutes early and take advantage of your special time with god until the snooze alarm arouses you once again use your shower time to talk with god or to sing songs of praise if you 
re mental organizer place god in your plans for the day as you are getting dressed 
make spiritual aspirations to god by short ardent movements of your heart present your soul to him thousand times during the day introduction to the devout life ryan 98 francis de sales urges us to reinforce 
this direction of intention throughout the day with short aspirations or prayers that lift our hearts to god if you drive to work reflect on the words of the psalmist for yourself and all those on the road the 
lord will guard your coming and going both now and forever ps 
121 take time too to notice the beauties of nature let your heart echo spontaneous prayers of thanksgiving to god for the mountains and hills rivers and streams of water birds and trees and flowers let all the 
earth cry out to the lord with joy try playing tapes in the car of praise music or of salesian topics available from the oblates of francis de sales as in all things our salesian saints would encourage us to 
use liberty of spirit 
once engaged in the work of the day at home or in business environment continue to lift your heart to god by the use of short prayers oh jesus am yours draw fie and will run holy spirit guide my work 
have point of focus which will refresh you periodically during the day picture in the corner of your desk or room or small cross in your pocket for those who work at the computer let me pass on suggestion that 
have found helpful to remind me of god presence during my work set the alarm of the computer so that it flashes the name of jesus on the screen at periodic intervals every 45 minutes or an hour and if you have 
break during lunch there are multiple web sites containing prayers or suggestions for reflection two of my favorites are sacred space the prayer site run by the irish jesuits and awaken to prayer how to pray 
as catholic 
finally francis urges us to make the time each day for quiet meditation or contemplation simply listening to god in the depths of our hearts setting aside the time each day requires discipline and commitment 
initially spending 10 15 minutes alone with god is wonderful practice 
reflecting on particular gospel passage saying familiar vocal prayers or allowing yourself to listen quietly to god in an attitude of openness and surrender are all ways suggested by our salesian saints 
perhaps st jane de chantal advice succinctly summarizes the best approach to all prayer 

draw near to god with the greatest simplicity you can and be certain that the simplest prayer is the best exhortations conferences and instructions

how do experience the gospel as good news at this point in my life in what ways 
do believe that am called to share the good news of jesus with others 
are there ways in which resist or shy away from sharing the good news of jesus with others 
how can evangelize at home at work in school with neighbors with friends 
how do need to be transformed by the good news of god love for me 
share all about it 
jesus appeared to the eleven as they were eating he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen jesus said to them go into all the world 
and preach the good news to all creation mark 16 14 15 
these are jesus parting words to his closest friends these are jesus parting words to those with whom he entrusted his message of salvation and redemption what was jesus saying to them what is jesus saying to 
us when we consider the mandate to go into the world and preach the good news to all creation we are speaking of evangelization in on evangelization in the modern world pope paul vi says that evangelization 
means bringing the good news into all strata of humanity and through its influence transforming humanity from within and making it new 
reflecting on pope paul vi definition paulist fathers frank desiano csp and kenneth boyack csp write 
if evangelization is the transformation of human nature by the proclamation of 
the good news if it is directed toward individuals and toward societies if it is dealing with particular lives and whole environments it would seem to cover just about everything the evangelizing
parish page 25 supply 
we sometimes refuse to believe that we have role to play in sharing christ good news with others 
sharing the good news of salvation and redemption ultimately involves everything evangelization ultimately involves everyone 
like the eleven sometimes we stubbornly refuse to believe that each of us has role to play in god plan of salvation we stubbornly believe that sharing the good news is only for special few we stubbornly 
believe that evangelization is for priests nuns brothers and missionaries or for others who make it fulltime job in obscure corners of the world 
each and everyone of us is called to share the good news of jesus however the ways in which we evangelize must fit the state and stage of life in which we find ourselves in other words while all of us are 
called to evangelize each of us must do it in ways particular to our circumstances responsibilities and relationships 
in the salesian tradition evangelization is really about the practice of devotion transforming our own thoughts feelings attitudes and actions with the love of god for most of us evangelization is less about 
preaching and more about being perfected it does no harm whatsoever but instead perfects all things so every vocation becomes more agreeable care of one family love of husband or wife service to others and 
every type of employment introduction to the devout ~ book one chapter 
simply put evangelization is not about bringing god to place or to people where god is not already present no sharing the good news is reminding ourselves and others in word in attitude in actions of god who 
is always present francis de sales tells us not only is god in the place where you are but also in your heart in the very center of your spirit supplies 

sharing the good news is about reminding ourselves of god who is always present 

evangelization is about living in the truth that god is always calling us to be more of who and how god created us to be the truth is that christ redeeming love has opened up the world of love to us the truth 
is that the spirit dwells within us and among us to transform us helping us to make real on earth something of the justice and peace the community and the communion of god kingdom 

that very good news how can we own it and share it today 
 
alone 
to what degree am lone ranger 
in what ways am reluctant to work with other people why 
in what ways am willing and able to work with others why 
what positive dimensions of collaboration have experienced when with whom what lessons might draw from these experiences 
what negative dimensions of collaboration have experienced when with whom what lessons might draw from these experiences 
how well do trust god myself and other people 

or with others it is not good that the man should 
be alone genesis 18 it not good for us either we are made to love we are made to be in relationship we are made to work play pray speak and listen together 
working playing and praying together requires trust it requires that we be open to who others really are it requires that we open who we really are to others it requires that we are willing to risk to succeed 
and even fail we are talking about collaboration 
collaboration is defined as mutual approach shared approach of identifying releasing and uniting the gifts of 
all baptized persons collaborative ministry 
seen through the eyes of salesian spirituality collaboration might be described as living jesus 
collaboration seems best suited for living in satisfying successful and sanctifying way of life to work together in helping to surface our own gifts and the gifts of others to help create world that more 
clearly reflects something of the saving power and promise of the kingdom of god 
there are five assumptions that provide foundation for living life in collaborative manner to share life with one another first god is the source of all gifts second all persons are gifted third all gifts are 
intended to help people achieve spiritual growth and integrity fourth these same gifts must help us to support others to achieve spiritual growth and integrity fifth it is about being open to and aware of the 
power and inspiration of the holy spirit in myself others and the events of daily life 
as great as this sounds why is working living and loving together so challenging sometimes why are we frequently tempted to go it alone rather than deal with the hassles or complications associated with 
working with others to accomplish some goal or pursue some purpose why do so many of us try to go it alone fear anxiety the belief that don have anything to give the feeling that don measure up there are many 
reasons most of which can be broken down into two categories supply 
attitudinal obstacles may want to win at all costs driven by the need to compete with others may suffer from narrow thinking discount the contributions of anyone outside of my family or group may be arrogant 
might consider myself superior to others and therefore have nothing to learn from others could also be burned out simply may not be able to reach beyond my own self absorption or frustration 

behavioral obstacles may be hostile toward others tough to collaborate with this one perhaps am unable or willing to deal with conflict maybe am victim of learned helplessness see myself as victim and all 
others as potential oppressors may lack basic social or relational skills might have trouble integrating the various facets of my life and therefore feel threatened by those who enjoy greater degree of 
integration or wholeness 

working playing and praying together requires trust 
these obstacles and many others like them can seriously undermine my ability to live life with others to live life to the fullest said another way our failure to collaborate can leave us in very lonely place 
seen through the eyes of salesian spirituality collaboration might be described as as dialogical mutual engagement in the art of living jesus it means teaching each other growing together mining the tradition 
together sharing the various wisdoms gained through our diverse life experiences leaven for the loaf 

st francis de sales challenged us be who you are be that well while we do indeed need to be ourselves we are most likely to do that successfully by being with one another 
that which truly satisfies 

on scale of one to ten how strong is my desire for justice 
do treat others in ways that would want them to treat me 
what are the circumstances or situations in which am more frequently tempted to be easy on myself but tough on others 
in what ways do need to be more single hearted how might be better at judging myself and others by the same standard 
can think of time when really tried to do the right thing how did it feel how was it satisfying 
how good am at living and practicing the golden rule 

hungering for what is right
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are those who hunger and thirst 
to see right prevail they shall be satisfied 
think of all the things for which we hunger and thirst love acceptance success peace forgiveness happiness truth joy where on our list do we find righteousness or justice 
to follow christ is to hunger and thirst for what is right for what is just how deeply do we want and work for righteousness how much is this desire part of our everyday lives how important is this in our 
relationships with others is our hunger and thirst for justice so strong that we sometimes think we can actually taste it 
we lose nothing by living generously nobly courteously and with royal just reasonable heart 

jesus promises us that there is satisfaction not only in later heaven but already right here on earth when we want and work for righteousness and justice however it not about doing more or doing extra it 
really about being true to our god given nature 
st francis de sales observed the following in part iii chapter 36 of his introduction to the devout life we are human solely because we possess reason yet it is indeed rare thing to find people who are truly 
reasonable this is because self love leads us away from reason and directs us imperceptibly into countless small yet dangerous acts of injustice or iniquity 
it is in our nature to hunger and thirst 
for justice unfortunately the effects of original sin and our own personal sins make it far more difficult for us to make the dream of justice reality 
 
how deeply do we want and work for righteousness how much is this desire part of our everyday lives how important is this thirst for justice in our relationships with others is our hunger for justice so strong 
that we can actually taste it 
 
the great enemy of justice and righteousness is living life with double standard francis de sales wrote we condemn every little thing in our neighbor but excuse ourselves of important things we want to sell 
for top dollar but want to buy at bargain prices we want everything we say to others to be well received but we are very tender and touchy about what others say about us we rigorously demand our own rights but 
want others to be considerate when demanding theirs we complain easily about our neighbors but we never want them to complain about us and the list goes on and on ibid 
the truth is that hungering and thirsting for justice isn about marching in parade or protest it not about volunteering in third world country it not about picketing or boycotting most days it about simply 
treating others the way we want to be treated not very complicated but no less demanding be just in all your actions wrote de sales always put yourself in your neighbor place and your neighbor in yours and 
then you will live rightly imagine yourself the seller when you buy and the buyer when you sell then you will sell and buy justly ibid 
curiously at least for francis de sales hungering and thirsting for righteousness is closely related to another beatitude being single hearted he concludes we lose nothing by living generously nobly 
courteously and with royal just and reasonable single heart examine your heart often to see if it is such toward your neighbor as you would like your neighbor to be toward you ibid 

hunger and thirst for righteousness live each day with single heart put yourself in your neighbor place find satisfaction in treating others justly and live satisfying life 
seeing god 
what does being single hearted mean to you at this point in your life 
in what ways do you find yourself tempted to do things or relate to others for self serving reasons 
can you think of recent situation or experience in which to the best of your recollection you did something for the best of motives how did that feel what were the circumstances who was involved how did things 
turn out 
in what areas of your life might you need to work to better purify your intentions or motives for doing what you do or being the way you are 
being single hearted 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the single 
hearted they shall see god 
there are number of ways to describe the single hearted those whose hearts are clean those whose hearts have been purified those whose motives are unadulterated hose who know themselves those who are guileless 
those who clearly know why they do what they do those who are able to see the truth because they attempt to live it themselves you get the idea 

cling only to the one desire to please 
god considering nothing else unless it fulfills that desire 
francis de sales offers great deal of reflection upon this beatitude this way of being blessed he looks to the to the example of the saints consider that their legs arms and heads are uncovered because in 
their thoughts affections and deeds they have no purpose or motive but that of pleasing god introduction to the devout life part chapter 
indeed this sets the standard for being single hearted francis de sales described it thus in the pursuit of virtue the less we consult our own interests the more the purity of divine love shines from those 
virtues m1 part iv chapter 14 put another way francis wrote that god seeks to lead us to great purity of heart renunciation of all self interest in what relates to god service and perfect self denial chapter 15 
the goal of the pure of heart the goal of the single hearted is union with the beloved francis wrote if approach and join myself to another for no purpose other than to be 
near that person and to enjoy this union it is an approach of pure and simple union treatise vii 
 
now the sovereign motive of our actions which is that of heavenly love has this sovereign property that being more pure it makes the actions that proceed from it more pure 
 
think about it no matter how deeply we love another person no matter how committed we are to doing what is right and just no matter how pure our motives there is always the temptation to love whom we love and 
to do what we do for less than noble or for self serving reasons what in this for me will this help my career will this make me more popular does this make me feel good will this give me an advantage 
francis de sales offers wonderful image in his treatise on the love of god of what it means to be truly single hearted in the service of god and by extension in the service of our brothers and sisters one of 
the world finest musicians who played the lute to perfection in brief time became so extremely deaf that he completely lost the use of his hearing however in spite of that he did not give up singing and 
playing the lute doing so with marvelous delicacy by reason of his great skill which his deafness had not taken away he derived no pleasure from his singing or in the sound of the lute since after his loss of 
hearing he could not perceive their sweetness or beauty hence he no longer sang or played except to entertain the prince whose native subject he was and whom he has great inclination as well as infinite 
obligation to please for this reason he had the very greatest pleasure in pleasing the prince and was overjoyed when the prince showed that he enjoyed the music book ix chapter 
in the pursuit of virtue the less we consult our own interests the more divine love shines from them 
single hearted doing what we do being who we are not because of any advantage / benefit to us but ultimately for god when we attempt to live this way we will not only see god clearly in the next life but will 
indeed glimpse god in this life making pure music to god through our motives of service to one another sons and daughters of god

how do we define peace how do i experience peace what things or activities help me to remain at peace 
in what areas of my life do lack peace what things cause me to lose peace how might need to strive for peace in my life 
how peace filled are my relationships are there any relationships in my life that are in need of peace 
what can i do to promote peace at home at work among my neighbors among my relatives and friends in what ways am an effective peacemaker 
how do need to be better peacemaker 

blessed are peacemakers 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is 
blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called children of god 
making peace is about establishing maintaining and nourishing right relationships right relations with god with self with others and with the created order 
peacemakers strive to create places in which evil 
violence and injustice are diminished and righteousness healing and justice are increased they are committed to making peace even in the face of misunderstanding resistance and 
hostility peacemakers work for integration health wholeness and holiness especially with the people with whom they interact every day 
live in peace often say to our lord that you want to be whatever god wants you to be 
francis de sales gives us much food for thought and action when it comes to making peace he wrote we must in all things and everywhere live peacefully if trouble exterior or 
interior comes upon us we must 
receive it peacefully if joy comes we must receive it peacefully without throbbing heart if we need to avoid evil we must do so peacefully without disquieting ourselves otherwise 
we may fall as we run away and 
give time to our enemy to kill us if there is peace to be promoted we must do that peacefully otherwise we might commit many faults in our hurry even our repentance itself must 
be made peacefully letters to religious 62 
we must in all things and everywhere live peacefully if trouble comes upon us we must receive it peacefully if there is peace to be promoted we must do that peacefully even our 
repentance itself must be made peacefully 
of course we know from human history and from our own personal experiences that peacemaking seems to bring with it its own share of trouble peacemaking is not only its own reward sometimes it is its own 
punishment ever heard the expression that no good deed goes unpunished 
in order to shed light on this truth st francis de sales offered the following observation our lord is called the prince of peace therefore wherever christ is absolute master all is peace yet it is true that 
before giving peace he causes war separating heart and soul from our dearest most intimate and most common affections mt 10 34 such as inordinate love of self confidence in self complacency in self and the 
like now when our lord separates us from such fondly cherished passions it seems as if our hearts have been flayed alive nevertheless notwithstanding all this writhing in spirit it is not without peace so long 
as we keep our will nailed to god will while in no way repudiating our obligations nor the brave fulfillment of them we do not lose peace to be at peace amid wars and to live in sweetness amid bitterness is to 
be truly prince of peace letters to religious 
to be sure then peace is not the same as the absence of conflict or difficulty it is about remaining grounded in the love of christ who is the source of all true and lasting peace 

our lord will give us peace when we resolve to live humbly and gently in state of war 

peace is something for which all of us deeply hope and long yet peace sometimes seems so very elusive how can we effectively promote peace for ourselves and others francis de sales offered this advice let us 
do three things and we shall have peace first let us have thoroughly pure intention of desiring the honor and glory of god in all things second let us do the little we can for that end and according to the 
advice of spiritual companions third let us leave to god the care of all the rest letters to religious 60 

live in peace walk in peace share it with others peacefully work

how do feel about work how do feel about my job 
do see the value of work do see god in whatever work paid or unpaid in which am engaged 
are there ways in which need to improve my appreciation of work 
are there ways in which need to better integrate my experience of work or labor with the other aspects of my life 
does work have role to play in my spiritual journey 
how might need to have more positive view or attitude toward my place of work our lot in life 
in his book spirituality @ work gregory pierce observes popular culture presents work as at best tedious distraction and at worst rat race in which in the words of comedian lily 
tomlin even if you win you ' re still rat chapter page 18 
work it seems has become four letter word gregory pierce concludes that for most people work is alienating oppressive exhausting anything but spiritual ibid 
is work nothing more than punishment is work nothing more than bur den if so how can work possibly play any part in pardon the expression the working out of our salvation 
work is all the effort paid or unpaid that we exert to make the world better place 
perhaps one reason for this unfortunate dichotomy is that when we think of holy men and women throughout the ages we often recall sculptures drawings and paintings in which the 
saints look anything but active 
our most active and energetic saints are sometimes pictured doing nothing more strenuous than holding lily or gazing piously heavenward and while these images can be moving and 
inspiring and helpful for times 
of contemplation if one is searching for models of action and energy they can hold somewhat less appeal james martin sj in patrons and protectors more occupations by michael 
neill mcgrath consider the 
possibility that it is our understanding of work that is the problem not work itself 

popular culture presents work as at best tedious distraction and at worst rat race 
 
the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines work as physical or mental effort or activity directed toward the production or accomplishment of something 
something that one is doing making 
or performing especially as an occupation or undertaking duty or task 
by this definition all of us work throughout all our lives we are working on tasks responsibilities opportunities hopes dreams and relationships on any given day at any given 
moment young or old active or 
retired salaried or volunteer we are all engaged in some kind of undertaking be it great or small 
it is in this light that james martin writes perhaps the most overlooked fact from christian history is that jesus worked we can easily envision jesus being instructed by saint 
joseph the master carpenter in 
joseph workshop in nazareth jesus would have learned about the raw materials of his craft joseph would have taught his apprentice the right way to drive nail with 
hammer to drill clean deep hole in plank to level ledge or lintel ibid 
can we not see how the skills of craftsman patience diligence perseverance honesty and others would later serve jesus well in his greatest work that of accomplishing the will of god by proclaiming the kingdom of god 
gregory pierce suggests that we need to see and experience work as all the effort paid or unpaid we exert to make the world better place little closer to the way god would have things spirituality @ work page 18 
 
how can work play any part in the working out of our salvation 

our god is the god of creation we are called to reflect the image and likeness of this creating god we accomplish this most clearly when we work to make our world our offices 
our neighborhoods and our homes places that more perfectly mirror the justice and peace of god 
work god work is indeed our lot in life our reason for being our purpose for living as we see in the life of jesus himself this work can be tiring laborious and frustrating 
still what could be more rewarding 
than using all of our energies to make all our little comers of the world more reflective of the kingdom of god 
come on there work to do 
 
compassion and contrition 

how do experience sorrow 
what kinds of situations circumstances or experiences result in my feeling sorrow 
am compassionate person am moved by the situations or plights of others how do express that compassion 
am truly sorry for my sins and imperfections does my sorrow over my sins and faults motivate me to try to do better with god help 
do experience the dark side of sorrow do find myself getting down or negative 
what kinds of things tempt me to experience unhealthy sorrow what can do to resist the negative effects of sorrow 

blessed are the sorrowful 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are 
the sorrowful they shall find consolation blessed happy are the sorrowful isn this contradiction in terms 
not if we understand the proper meaning of sorrow as francis de sales did sorrow is an affection that makes us share in the suffering and sorrow of the ones we love sorrow 
makes others experiences of good and evil our own treatise on the love of god book chapter 
 
sorrow is an affection that makes us share in the suffering of others as well as owning our own suffering 
sorrow of this kind is the basis for empathy sympathy and compassion it is the result of being affected and impacted by the plights of others it is manifestation of our 
willingness to be moved by the struggles 
setbacks and calamities of those whom we encounter de sales wrote piety is virtuous sorrow which comes into our hearts in order to make us desire to deliver our neighbor from 
the evil that he or she endures treatise book chapter 
jesus challenge is obvious to the extent that we are moved by the plight of others and try to be source of consolation and support we too are more likely to find coorrow and 
setback in our own lives 

this sorrow of which jesus speaks is also an expression of contrition for our own sinfulness francis de sales remarked perfect penitence has two effects sorrow that separates 
us from sin and love which reconciles and reunites us with god treatise book ii chapter 20 

perfect penitence has two effects first it produces sorrow that separates us from sin second it opens us to love that reconciles us and reunites us with god 

there is an interesting flip side to this sorrow francis observed the throne of god mercy is our sorrow therefore the greater our sorrow the greater should be our confidence 
conferences ii page 19 as profound 
as our sorrow for our own sin may be this sorrow should indeed be ultimately overshadowed by our confidence in god long suffering and abundant patience with us and forgiveness 
of us put another way this sorrow 
at its best should be an expression of profound humility humility allows us to see the real good that god has planted in us conferences vi 76 sorrow for sin should lead us to 
reaffirm our god given dignity and 
to redouble our efforts in giving witness to our god given goodness by our thoughts feelings attitudes and actions 
however we need to be cautious like many things in life our sorrow needs to be balanced healthy sorrow can quickly become something unhealthy and debilitating francis de sales 
offered this advice in his 
introduction to the devout life sorrow can be either good or evil according to the ways in which it affects us true enough it can produce more bad effects than good ones it has 
two good effects compassion and 
repentance whereas it has six evil ones anxiety sloth wrath jealousy envy and impatience part iv chapter 12 
healthy sadness in an expression of our sorrow for sin or evil 
we know that we have tendency to avoid sorrow at any and all costs francis de sales reminds us that sorrow is helpful even necessary if we are to be truly happy in this life 
healthy sorrow allows us to display 
compassion for sufferings of others and to experience repentance for our sins and imperfections still we need to experience to practice—sorrow in ways that does not inhibit or 
retard our growth as sons and aughters of the living god 

remember it blessed are the sorrowful not the miserable how do we deal 
replace replacement nerve garden gardening gardener wear wearing wore divorce chill chilly orthopedic
has my faith in good caring and provident god been shaken by such tragic events as september 11 2001 
does my faith help me to deal with tragic events either public or private if yes how if no why not 
how do find comfort when am affected by things like sickness separation or death 
people claim that sharing sorrow or grief can lessen the pain is this your experience 
how do try to comfort those who suffer how have others tried to comfort me 
how would answer the question why do bad things happen to good people 

with tragic events 

as believers we try to see all the events of life with the eyes of god even those including suffering loss tragedy and depth our faith challenges us to believe that the redemptive and saving power of the cross 
of christ is present in all our experiences especially in those most painful but the terrible acts of terrorism that occurred on september 11 2001 have shaken our faith we wonder aloud or in the quiet of our 
hearts where was god on the morning of september 11th how could loving and all powerful god allow such horrible thing to occur why does god allow such terrible things to happen to good innocent people 
 
how do answer these and similar questions for others for that matter how do answer them for myself 

remember one attempt at explaining this mystery that heard when was in graduate school when you look at the back of tapestry all you see are knotted and gnarled threads that are intertwined in chaotic and 
unsightly fashion this appearance is confusing at best outright ugly at worst by contrast the front of the tapestry is beautiful masterpiece that soothes the mind heart and spirit 

when we come face to face with evil we are as it were looking at the backside of the tapestry of life we see its chaos sin pain suffering and injustice of course even in the midst of evil life has yet another 
side goodness justice freedom reconciliation and peace because of the victory of the resurrection over sin suffering and death good has and will triumph over evil despite the appearance at times to the 
contrary at the end of history it will be clear that
love will conquer all until the second coming only faith can find consolation in this truth 

still any attempt on our part to make sense of evil is ultimately unsatisfactory how much comfort can my explanation bring to grieving parents whose child has been killed by drunk driver how can the image of 
the tapestry of life console husband whose wife loses her fight with cancer leaving him alone to care for four young children 
months pass wounds heal life goes on and we try to go on with it even to the degree that peoples lives may return to normal at some point following the experience of tragic suffering injustice or loss are they 
ever really normal again people will still struggle to understand why terrible things happen to any of us 
francis de sales himself grappled with this issue he readily admitted that some mysteries are inscrutable exceeding our ability to grasp them fully this is especially true of destructive acts of nature or 
horrific results of the human ability to choose for francis de sales it is only in the next life that we will understand the mysteries and conflicts of this life 
 
however we must strive to be sources of consolation and strength to others when terrible sometimes unspeakable things happen to good people or to anybody for that matter in the end it is probably not our words 
no matter how informed or carefully crafted that will make healing sustaining difference in the lives of those men woman and children touched by tragedy no what ultimately helps are hands that reach out to 
them in love and arms that cradle them in their grief 

how ready are our hands our arms and our hearts to reach out to others 
being yourself 
is there harmony in my life among my faith my relationship with god my relationships with family and friends my work or do feel conflict 
do sometimes feel as though am just acting just putting on show rather than saying and doing what is really in my heart 
how transparent am willing to be am willing to allow people to know me to see who am 
where do my energies go are they scattered and dissipated or are they channeled toward being who god calls me to be 
do know who god is calling me to be or do need to spend more time with god in prayer and discernment 

being authentic 
salesian spirituality is lived from the inside out it begins in the heart and flows outward when love of god is inscribed in our hearts all of our actions will be authentically loving 
since the heart is the source of all our actions as the heart is so are they 
actions that do not flow from loving heart while they might be outwardly admirable are hollow 
person considers herself very devout because she recites daily multiplicity of prayers although immediately afterwards she utters the most disagreeable arrogant and injurious words in her home and among her 
neighbors still another draws alms out of his purse to give to the poor but cannot draw meekness out of his heart to forgive his enemies people such as these are commonly 
perceived as devout when in fact they are not a mess 
our spiritual life is not something extra not something added onto our everyday lives our spiritual life is integrated into every part of our lives 
st francis de sales taught that life of true devotion is authentic true devotion comes from the heart there is no conflict between the inside and the outside our spirituality permeates our whole being 
authenticity means that the love of god invades our soul takes root there grows and bears fruit 
we find model of authenticity in the life and ministry of jesus wherever he went jesus attracted people because there was something trustworthy about him something in his manner and message that touched people 
hearts his ministry reflected deep and intimate relationship with his father and was nourished by life of prayer jesus lived his life from the inside out it was precisely because of this congruity between 
jesus inside and jesus outside that he taught and spoke with authority people found jesus to be not only informative more importantly they found him to be believable 
authenticity for us means allowing the word of god to enter our heart and transform us life of faith love and service in imitation of jesus will be the fruit of that transformation the spirit will be able to 
work in and through us in ways that go far beyond our everyday expectations 
integrity is another way to think of authenticity our spiritual life is not something extra not something added onto our everyday lives our spiritual life is integrated into every 
part of our lives our actions give expression to the love that is in our hearts 
we are called to be holy and authentic whatever our state in life we need to know who we are and to be who we are 

be who you are and be that well 

when we are authentic we are in right relationship with ourselves there is integrity wholeness and harmony among all of the parts of the complex universe within us our focus is sharpened because our motives 
and actions are pure and unambiguous being authentic being real with ourselves enables us to be authentic to be real with others we can allow them to see who we truly are and to 
know who we truly are we in turn are better able to see and accept others for who they really are 
ultimately such authenticity such honesty such integrity allows us to accept the truth of who we are in the eyes of god accepting the truth of who we are better enables us with 
gods grace to accept the truth of who we might yet become 

the fruit of knowing and being authentic is inner harmony inner peace 

engrave and inscribe on your heart this holy sacred maxim live jesus am sure that your life which comes from the heart just as the almond tree comes 
no time 
how good am at living in the present 
are there things in my past upon which dwell too often what are they why do they hold my attention 
are there things in my future about which am anxious or distracted what are they why do they hold my attention 
living in the present is hard work it requires discipline but it is skill that can be developed with little simple steps what can do to better live each present moment to the fullest 
what in my past needs reconciliation and healing 
about what in my future do need faith and confidence 

like the present 
in his book entitled the seven secrets of successful catholics author paul wilkes observes ours is life lived in the present tense memories may be precious or 
painful plans lofty or low but all we really have 
to live is today each day each hour brings with it opportunities for our spirits to soar for us to become the people we know we can be 
do you have regrets about your past do you sometimes wonder how your life might be different if you had made different choices in the past do you frequently 
revisit painful or unresolved memories 
are you anxious about the future do you worry about the things that might happen in the days weeks and years to come do you spend time trying to anticipate what 
tomorrow will bring welcome to the human race it is natural to live with an eye to
the past it is natural to live with an eye toward the future however focusing only upon the past or the future robs you the time that really matters 
the present the struggle to live in the present is nothing new our lord jesus himself addressed it in matthew gospel mt 
25 34 when he said do not worry about your life who of you by worrying can add single hour to your life do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about 
itself each day has enough trouble of its own 
st francis de sales and st jane de chantal frequently counseled people who were either imprisoned by past sins struggles and failures or fixated upon future 
challenges trials or tribulations some especially tormented souls were consumed by both 
the remedy for scruples flowing from the past the day that is past must not judge the day present the day that is present must not judge the day past it is only 
the last day that judges all 
the remedy for anxieties flowing from the future let us be firmly resolved to serve god with our whole heart and life beyond that let us have no care about 
tomorrow let us think of only living well today and when tomorrow comes it will be called today then we can think about it 
living in the present is good psychology the present is the only place where you grow as you grow you can gracefully let go of painful past as you grow you can 
peacefully embrace an uncertain future in short you experience forgiveness and fortitude 

living in the present is sound theology there is no beginning or end for god there is only an eternal now to that end you are most like god when you live in the 
present as you grow in the image and likeness of 
god you open yourself to the power of god forgiveness as you grow in the image and likeness of god you open yourself to the promise of god providence 

in short you experience redemption 
maybe this is what st paul had in mind when he made the assertion tell you now is the time of god favor now is the day of salvation 

experience healing from the past experience confidence about the future above all recognize the opportunities that god brings each day each hour each moment to 
let your spirit soar to become more of the person who god calls you to be 

in the here and now in the present 
to forgive as god forgives 
how merciful and forgiving am do try to treat others with mercy leniency clemency forbearance and charity 
in what ways or situations am tempted to not extend mercy toward others 
how has god been merciful to me how has god been lenient compassionate kind and forgiving to me 
do try to forgive as god forgives 
what are some things in my life that make it more difficult or challenging for me to be merciful 

blessed are the merciful 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the merciful mercy shall be shown 
to them 
let us begin by first examining more closely our understanding of mercy itself it is defined as kind and compassionate treatment of an offender enemy prisoner or other person under one power clemency 
disposition to be kind and forgiving mercy emphasizes compassion in general way it suggests reprieve from fate of considerable severity without further implication american heritage dictionary new college 
edition 
synonyms associated with mercy include leniency clemency forbearance and charity 

from the heights of heaven jesus 
christ mercifully looks upon you and graciously invites you there 
 
we turn our attention to the gospel of matthew to understand the importance that mercy plays in our relationships with god and our relationships with one another the parable of the unmerciful servant unique to 
matthew is one of the sternest passages of the gospels it reinforces the duty of forgiveness by appealing to another motive the forgiveness granted by man to man as condition of forgiveness granted to man by 
god the jerome biblical commentary in the parable king ultimately cancels huge debt owed to him not by slave but high officer of state this same officer by contrast when confronting subordinate who owed him 
mere fraction of what the former owed the king refuses to hear the subordinate plea of mercy when word gets back to the king the official is condemned for his unwillingness to show mercy and is turned over to 
torturers 
 
mercy empathy and sympathy are closely related they enable us to enter the mind heart shoes or skin of another person they enable us to put ourselves in the place of another they enable us to truly know and 
 
the jerome biblical commentary concludes the conduct of the king is not model by which we should learn about the providence of god the detail that is most significant is the difference in the debt owed by the 
unmerciful servant and the debt that he claims the model is the forgiveness of god which knows no limit and neither should man forgiveness if man does not forgive he cannot expect forgiveness if he does not 
renounce his own claims which are small he cannot ask god to dismiss the claims presumably much greater against him ibid 
francis de sales places high premium upon the mercy of god he wrote god did not save us out of justice for anything we have done but according to god mercy treatise part chapter 18 god mercy not only saved us 
however but also enables us to be the people that god calls us to be god assists us to strive toward the life to which god calls us in this way god shows us divine mercy by not asking us to strive for 
something that is unobtainable 

god how merciful is god goodness to us in the end all of the good we do depends on god mercy 

how seriously do we think about the lord prayer when we pray it how conscious are we of the explicit link that we acknowledge that exists between god forgiveness of us and our forgiveness of one another how 
conscious are we of our obligation as followers of jesus to be as merciful with others as god is merciful with us 
make no mistake about it we are most human when we show mercy to others in fact we are most divine when we show mercy to others if that not motivation enough scripture is quite clear if we wish to enjoy god 
mercy we must extend mercy to one another from our hearts 
what are friends for 
who are the people in my life whom would describe as friends 
in what ways to they befriend me 
how do they help me to be the kind of person that god wants me to be 
are there any faults or imperfections in my friends that need to gently address 
are there any dimensions echoes or shadows of sin in my friend ships 
what kind of friend am 
do encourage my friends to do what is right and good in the eyes of god 
what faults or imperfections do need to address in myself 
in what ways must purify myself from sin or the affection for sin 

our growth in holiness 
in the salesian tradition having friends is more than just good or desire able thing true friends are irreplaceable allies in our efforts to grow in holiness drawing from the book of sirach st francis de sales 
wrote faithful friend is strong defense and those who find one have found treasure faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality those who fear the lord find one idl part chapter 

so important is the subject and nature of friendship that francis de sales devotes no less than six chapters of his introduction to the devout life to its consideration in part iii chapter 19 he observed love 
everyone with deep love based on charity but form friendships only with those who can share virtuous things with you the higher the virtues you share and exchange with others the more perfect your friendship 
will be 
 love everyone with great love but have no friendship except for those that communicate with you in the things of virtue 
three things must be present in order for relationship to be considered friendship all love is not friendship because we can love without being loved in such cases there is love but not friendship since 
friendship is mutual love and if not mutual it is not friendship second it is not sufficient for it to be merely mutual persons who love each other must be aware of their reciprocal affection if they are not 
aware of the affection it is not friendship third there must also be communication between them and this is the basis of friendship 
holy friendship speaks plain and sincere language it commends nothing but virtue and the grace of god the only foundation on which it subsists 
francis identified three levels or kinds of friendship each of which is recognized by the focus of the exchange between or among the friends being considered if this participation is in matters of knowledge 
the resulting friendship is certainly very praiseworthy it is still more so if you have virtues in common namely prudence temperance fortitude and justice if your mutual and reciprocal exchanges concern 
charity devotion and christian perfection god how precious this friendship will be 
friends then when at their best walk with and encourage one another along the road to salvation 
of course like lots of things in life even friends aren always at their best sometimes our friendships don exactly draw us closer to god or to the things of god francis addressed this reality as well there is 
hardly anyone who is entirely free from imperfections everyone has enough bad inclinations of their own without burdening oneself with others’ friendship requires us to aid and assist one another to be free 
from every kind of fault while we must meekly put up with friend faults we must not lead them into faults much less imitate their faults 
when it comes to sin however friendship takes no prisoners as to sins we must neither occasion them nor tolerate them in our friends wrote de sales it is either weak or sinful friendship that watches our 
friend perish without helping him that sees the other die of abscess and does not save her life by opening it with the lance of correction genuine living friendship cannot continue in the midst of sin 
the more exquisite the virtues that are the focus of your communications the more perfect also shall your friendship be 
friends are for our growth in health happiness and holiness on this earth in order to better prepare us to share together the gift of eternal life in heaven 
st jane described spiritual friendship this way nearly four hundred years ago to the sisters of the visitation if we are closely united one with another we shall walk with great strides to perfection 
god grant us make us such friends as we walk together with great strides along the road to perfection 
five steps 
how much serenity do experience at this point in my life 
what are the areas of my life in which am experiencing the greatest need for serenity 
of the five steps that francis de sales offers which one do find most attractive why 
of the five steps that francis de sales offers which do find most challenging why 
do make time and space for prayer even the simplest forms of prayer during an average day 
what temptations in my life sorely try my attempts to practice serenity 
what practices or attitudes do find most helpful in my attempts to be even tempered 

to spiritual serenity 

serenity composure equanimity these nouns describe the state of person who is calm or centered and who is not easily agitated the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines it as the quality 
of being calm and even tempered having composure which comes from the latin for even tempered or impartial the ability to remain centered or even tempered in the midst of the demands and challenges of every 
day life is tremendously important quality and frequently enough highly elusive one while there is no easy or painless way to acquire this quality st francis de sales offers us five step program that can 
increase our ability to practice and experience serenity 

be on the watch for those temptations that weaken our resistance to sin and / or dissuade us from doing good –

step one choose to live life of devotion make conscious decision to spend each day doing what is right and good do what is right and good readily diligently and frequently st francis de sales writes true 
devotion perfects all things every vocation becomes more agreeable when united with true devotion care of one family becomes more peaceable love of husband or wife more sincere service to one employer more 

step two prayer prayer helps us to remain centered prayer helps us to remain anchored prayer helps us to deal with what happens around us while avoiding agitation inside us 

develop practice and strengthen those habits that support your resolve to live life of devotion 
make time for personal prayer practice the awareness of the presence of god prepare your day anticipate all that you must accomplish or might encounter today make an examination of conscience twice day once 
around noon the second in early evening reflect on scripture or other spiritual reading as part of larger commitment to prayer make use of the sacraments eucharist reconciliation and when appropriate anointing 
seek the grace and courage you need to lead life of serenity in the midst of life activities 

step three practice virtue develop practice and strengthen those habits that support your resolve to live life of devotion in the salesian tradition some of the more important virtues include 

prayer helps us to remain centered prayer helps us to remain anchored while avoiding agitation 

step five rest retreat renewal take / make opportunities for spiritual time out in the midst of each day activities where possible make an actual retreat every year take time make space to examine your progress 
on the road to devotion seek forgiveness for your failings give thanks for your successes above all find ways to remind you of the things in life that really matter and that lead to serenity in the hereafter 
gentleness 
do i see the value of gentleness 
do i have real difficulties inbeing patient and gentle with others 
do i have real difficulties inbeing patient or gentle with myself 
how do i handle setbacks and disappointments in my life 
how do i respond or react when things don ' t go my way 
what are the things that push my buttons and tempt me to lose my cool with myself 
what are the things that push my buttons and tempt me to lose my cool with others 

forgotten virtue 

in world in which the pace of life has become more frenetic and hectic we seem to be lot less patient and lot more prone to anger with one another any wonder we have so many ways to describe this behavior this 
person went postal that person exhibited road rage so and so had meltdown 
we really seem to have lost our sense to say nothing of the practice of gentleness 
jesus himself spoke of the importance of gentleness in matthew gospel 

take my yoke upon your shoulders and learn from me for am gentle and humble of heart 

gentleness is not very popular virtue or value these days in some ways we have ourselves to blame gentleness is often translated as meek which is perceived and even defined in some places as being spineless 
weak pushover or wimp 
small wonder that gentleness has fallen on hard times in our time 
jesus is not calling us to weakness in fact he is calling us to kind of strength and tenacity that can only result from taking up his yoke that is embracing all the challenges that come each and every day to 
those who attempt to live god centered life 
here it seems to me is the rub we grow impatient and angry with others when we experience conflict disappointment or difficulties with others because we expect that nothing and no one should interfere with our 
plans for life small wonder therefore when others faults sins and imperfections seem to conspire to stand in our way 
life is not perfect other people aren perfect god forbid even am not perfect 

sad to say there is an ever deeper reality that we need to confront sometimes the person with whom we are ultimately angry and impatient is ourselves 
why is gentleness such an important virtue simply because life is not perfect others aren perfect not perfect when we live our lives so intolerant of others and our own imperfections we look for and experience 
nothing but trouble 
what burden 
st francis de sales struggled with anger and impatience in his own life he had sense of urgency in his personal and professional endeavors that sorely tempted his practice of gentleness just as he learned that 
he could not force himself or others to grow in holiness he also recognized that it was only when he was able to graciously embrace life heartaches disappointments frustrations and failures that he could truly 
hope to work through and overcome them 
the paradox only when we can accept the burdens of life does life cease to be so burdensome before we can expect life to get better we must first accept life as it is 
the practice of this virtue needs to start at home we need to begin with ourselves we need to accept the reality of our sins our weaknesses our faults and failings we need to ask god for the grace to move 
through and beyond them without beating up on ourselves our energies are better used by cooperating with god saving grace than by being in constant state of frustration or rage 

only when we accept the burdens of life does life become less burdensome 

likewise we need to be gentle toward one another especially the people we know and love the most in truth these are the people whose faults and failings are most obvious to us therefore it is all the more 
important that we acknowledge that they too are not perfect but rather are works god’ works in progress 

moving forward let drive learn live and love gently 
 
first things 
what can do to tie my heartstrings closer to god how can friends help me 
how do feel about letting go and taking francis advice to live one day at time leaving the rest to god care 
is it difficult for me not to worry about things which cannot control 
have been hurt over something in the past which hinders me from being all that can be today how do feel about honestly facing that hurt and moving on so that can grow closer to god 
how do feel about preparing for the day planning what will do and how will go about doing it do feel that it is practical and possible to direct all my intentions towards growing closer to god 
respecting the dignity of persons is often about forgiving and forgetting forgiving is gift you give yourself which becomes the start or impetus for forgetting and in the end healing how then is respecting the 
dignity of another healthy thing for me 

first 
our lives are filled with choices should we do this or should we do that should we go here or should we go there 
indeed our complicated lifestyles often bring conflicting demands which frequently can become too much for us to handle how often have we thought to ourselves if life would just slow down little could get 
things done easier but the question remains how can slow myself down and make better live each moment as it comes 
francis de sales tells us that the salesian spirit is deeply rooted in our efforts to grow in grace through the little day to day experiences of life de sales knew that stress anxiety and even panic are not 
the answer to either accomplishing things or finding peace he compares our frenzied lives to caged bird and our finding peace to bird who is free the former flutters his wings so much that he entraps himself 
all the more but like the second little bird without constraints when we stop the wing flapping we soar closer to god we can start this growth process by praying and prioritizing our daily activities 
first we should take time everyday to pray francis writes that when little bees are caught in storm they take hold of small stones so that they can keep their balance when they fly prayer like the stones can 
balance us it helps us to make the best use of each day each moment as it comes 
eventually as we fly we free ourselves to see that our vocation or our calling in life is our means to holiness imagine being holy by just doing our everyday jobs de sales terms this process living in the 
present moment and he teaches that everybody can achieve it and achieve it well 
god has not placed perfection in the multiplicity of acts we perform to please him but only in the way we perform them which is simply to do the little we do according to our vocation in love by love and for 
love 
slowing down our pace and living more simply can still permit us to engage in the busyness of everyday life but it is anew sense of peace which helps us to stop dwelling on the past or being anxious about the 
future 
de sales was busy bishop and professional man in his introduction to devout life he writes that lawyer must go from prayer to the courtroom the merchant from prayer to his store homemaker from prayer to her 
responsibilities each person he writes needs gentleness that will not cause distress this gentleness helps us pray and work better and to see that both are gift from god 
st jane de chantal was wife widow mother single parent businesswoman and later nun indeed jane was one busy lady when for example she responded to god call to transition from widowhood to founding the sisters 
 of the visitation de sales warned her that she would come under some serious criticism both from her family and friends he was quite correct still she moved on with her life she was truly lover of god finding 
peace in everyday simplicity and prayer 
even when we seek to live in the present moment we may regret the past or fret about an uncertain future and sadden ourselves 
sometimes even when we seek to live in the present moment we may regret the past or fret about an uncertain future and sadden ourselves de sales paraphrases st paul cor 17 10 when he states that human sorrow 
is both blessing and curse like compass needle which always points north regardless of the ship course if we will aspire toward god de sales says those changes of life will not unsteady us though sadness can 
appear negative it can instill in us sense of repentance and compassion and lead us to virtue as we strive to overcome it 

salesian spirituality invites us to trust in god providence either god will protect us from misfortune or god will give us the strength to bear it with confidence we can cast our cares on god 
because he cares for us 

in the midst of all the things that fill each day let put first things first 
easier said 
what is my notion of justice 
do my actions and attitudes promote justice 
am too critical of others injustices but too lax regarding my own 
how do give good example to others of the importance of promoting justice in the lives of others 
in what areas of my life do need to be more effective in pursuing justice 
what injustices might need to recognize in my own life 
from whom might need to seek forgiveness 
how far am willing to go in promoting justice 

than done 
we all want justice we all want justice for ourselves we all want justice for those we know and love we all want justice hopefully for all people 
what does it mean to be just the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines it as honorable and fair in one dealings and actions consistent with what is morally right righteous suitable or 
proper fitting to conform with moral righteousness in action or attitude 
god is the ultimate model and source of all justice perhaps no where else do we see this proclaimed so clearly in scripture as we do in the book of psalms psalm awake my god decree justice psalm god will 
govern the people with justice psalm 
god is the ultimate model and source of all justice 
16 the lord is known by his justice psalm 33 the lord loves righteousness and justice psalm 89 14 justice is the foundation of your throne psalm 99 the king is mighty and loves justice psalm 101 will sing of 
your love and justice of course it is lot easier to simply talk about our desire even our demand for justice than it is to make it real in our own lives and in the lives of others 
francis de sales knew of the difficulties of making justice real when he wrote of the virtue of zeal in his treatise on the love of god in this selection he identified three means or levels of promoting and 
doing what is just the firsthod is not surprisingly the most popular we can promote justice by pointing out other failure to do so this is obviously the easiest because while it demands that we recognize 
the injustices of others it does not require us to do the same of ourselves consumed with do as say not as do mentality we run the risk of being blind in our own supply 
it is lot easier to simply talk about our desire even our demand for justice than it is to make it real in our own lives and in the lives of others 
concerns as it relates to promoting justice thishod believed de sales is the least effective way to promote justice 
the second way to promote justice is
to be less concerned about what others are doing or not doing and to demonstrate our passion by doing acts of great virtue in order to give good example by suggesting remedies for evil encouraging others to 
apply them and doing the good opposed to the evil that we wish to eradicate tlg book ten chapter 16 insofar as this requires us to not only talk the talk but walk the walk francis claimed that few of us are 
anxious to do 
the third the most excellent and the most challenging level or method of promoting justice consists in suffering and enduring many things in order to prevent or avert evil almost no one wants to exercise this 
kind of passion for proclaiming and accomplishing all that is just 

this most demanding but most powerful means of working for justice requires that we be willing to risk everything for what is righteous and just sometimes even life itself no where do we see this risking for 
what is righteous more clearly than in the person of jesus himself no where do we see the passion and price for pursuing what is just more powerfully than on the cross of calvary st francis de sales wrote our 
lord passion appeared principally in his death on the cross to destroy death and the 

no where do we see this risking for what is righteous more clearly than in the person of jesus himself no where do we see the passion and price for pursuing justice more powerfully than on the cross of calvary 

sins of humanity to imitate this method is perfection of courage and an unbelievable fervor of spirit 

the merit of one passion for justice is measured by the willingness to do and suffer for what is right how does my passion measure up 
tools 

what virtues do seem to practice the best at this point in my life 
in what situations are they helpful and effective 
in what situations have they been more difficult or problematic fit 
with which virtues am less comfortable or adept 
what virtues might god be calling me to acquire and practice more at this point in my life 
what things may god be calling me to craft or build at this time in my life which tools seem most necessary or appropriate to the tasks 

of the trade 

my father was builder he built cars for chrysler he built helicopters for boeing vertol what remember most were all the things he built around the house cabinets shelves shutters molding trim and other things 
he was passionate about building he was good at it too 
as boy sometimes sat for hours on stool and watched him create things at his workbench he had tools lots of tools each had its own unique purpose and function 
in the years that observed him build learned three things there is tool for every job there is job for every tool and there no one tool that does it all 
didn inherit my father gift for working with wood yet as enter more deeply into the heart of salesian spirituality more deeply appreciate the wisdom that guided all of my father endeavors in the introduction 
to the devout life francis de sales writes 

frequently the
great fault of those undertaking the practice of virtue is to stubbornly insist upon using particular one in all circumstances 

as useful as saw may be you can drive nails with one as sophisticated as drill press is you shouldn try to cut lumber with one as simple and effective as hammer may be you don use one to cut glass 
the art and discipline of salesian spirituality is about acquiring and mastering as many of the virtues as possible it also challenges us to learn how to match each virtue with the situation relationship or 
circumstance at hand 
retiree bye cancel conceal painter planting plantings programing programmer
pot pothead insured insurer engineer engineered
we must resist the temptation to become attached to or infatuated with favorite virtue 

and try to make it fit every task or job in life after all if all we ever use is hammer eventually everything in life tends to look like nail 
we are created in the image and likeness of god the master craftsman and the master builder we are called to build the
kingdom of god on this earth precisely in the particular state stage and place in life in which we find ourselves through the inspiration and guidance of the holy spirit we must craft relationships families 
and communities that promote justice and peace reconciliation and healing love and life 

as we attempt to acquire the tools and knowledge needed to live life of virtue we look to the humble gentle compassionate and patient jesus as our teacher guide and companion 

we can force one tool to do it all we need to apply the tools that each situation requires and so to practice discipline that requires the utmost flexibility 

we must keep our minds in tranquility in order to do everything in its season observed st jane de chantal there is time for every tool 

four virtues are absolutely essential in helping to build the kingdom of god 
humility be humble enough to know that there are many tools for living that we can learn from god and one another gentleness we need to let the tools we acquire do the work we must not try to force them 
flexibility we need to select the right tool for the job the right job for the tool we can get attached to select favorite patience creating worthwhile things on earth takes time if rome wasn built in day 
imagine the time required to build something that will last forever in heaven 

in the spirit of st francis de sales and st jane de chantal may we follow the example of our savior who is the son of god and who perhaps not coincidentally was also the son of carpenter 
pursuing perfection 
what does being perfect mean to me 
what does being perfect look or feel like 
how do go about the pursuit of perfection am calm centered and balanced do approach perfection in neurotic or compulsive manner 
for whom do seek perfection god glory or my own 
how does my desire for perfection impact upon my relationships with others 
what are the areas in my life most in need of being perfected or purified what are the best ways of me to address this need in my life right now 

peacefully and patiently 

the salesian tradition holds the human person in high esteem notwithstanding the effects of original sin we are created in the image of god redeemed by jesus christ and inspired by the holy spirit we are good 
by design we are destined for glory 
of course the road to glory has its share of potholes we frequently fail to do the good to which we are called we often do the evil that we are called to avoid in short we don always measure up to our god 
given dignity or destiny 
st jane de chantal believed in the 

we are good by design we are destined for glory 
possibility of human perfection however she was very clear as to the motive for seeking perfection do you think it is to please your understanding or to give you satisfaction no it all must be for the glory of 
god alone making you pliable humble cordial and frank toward others 
conferences 
the problem with pursuing perfection 
is that while we may begin this endeavor with the aim of being more of who god calls us to be our efforts can result with our simply being more full of ourselves true perfection should lead to humility and 
gentleness false perfection leads to pride and arrogance 
the art and discipline of pursuing perfection for st jane de chantal is to pursue it without obsessing about your progress think about it isn the best way to get the most out of leisurely car ride is to get to 
the point where you are enjoying the ride so much that you forget that you are driving 
st jane wrote am pleased to see that you are cutting back on all of your self scrutiny and that you are more peaceful about your desire to make progress eagerness about becoming perfect comes from self love 
always be on guard against this beg of you 
put another way an inordinate desire to be perfected by the will of god can actually be not so camouflaged attempt to glory in one own will and preference such compulsion can be the source of great pain and 
perplexity in our lives observed st jane this is all about your over eagerness to attain the true happiness that you desire you lack the patience and docility to do the will of god who alone can grant you the 
progress and perfection for which you are striving for those who truly wish to pursue perfection they must correct this over eagerness and anxiety 
pursuing perfection needs to be less about us and much more about god it is about our relationship with the father son and spirit seen in this light true christian perfection is all about focus the way to 
perfection is very narrow but it is solid short simple and sure and soon leads the soul to its ultimate goal total union with god 
patience has lot to do with pursuing perfection st francis de sales remarked know that patience is the one virtue that gives us the greatest assurance of our reaching perfection while we must have patience 
with others we must especially have patience with ourselves 
those who aspire to the pure love of god need to be more patient with themselves than with others 
another secret to the discipline of pursuing perfection includes accepting our imperfections st francis de sales observed we have to endure our own imperfections in order to attain perfection say endure 
patiently not love or embrace them humility is nurtured through such endurance 

in the end pursuing perfection is about leaving the results of our efforts in the hands of god said st jane we must be as satisfied to feel powerless idle or inert before god as to be full of life with ease 
and devotion the whole matter of our union with god and our perfection is to be content either way 
step by step 

in what ways are my days frenzied and hectic 
are there specific moments in my day that are fertile with holiness moments that are straw waiting to be spun into gold 
is it possible to lead this kind of life in my busy world today how 
what are some practical things that can do to help me apply francis de sales advice to go into my heart from time to time during the course of the day 
how can living in the present moment be powerful means of growing in holiness how can it help me to be faithful to all the things in my busy life 

meeting life demands 

in hectic world of frenzied activities multiple commitments and looming deadlines the thought of walking gentle prayerful path might seem idealistic and unattainable more than ever we need to practice 
francis de sales spirit of gentleness and calm in the midst of all our busyness 
his world lacking the gadgets the multimedia and the rush that pervade our era was nonetheless jam packed with the 
how good to let providence guide you step by step 
responsibilities demanded of bishop spiritual director pastor and prolific writer francis had trained himself to walk gently and calmly through the busyness of the most hectic days keeping part of his heart 
focused on god he wanted his spiritual children to do the same it is here philothea1 that want you to firmly follow my advice for it deals with one of the surest means for your spiritual advancement remember 
to withdraw frequently into the solitude of your heart even though you may be in the midst of conversations and affairs 
the latest saint among the followers of salesian spirituality leonie frances de sales aviat learned to do this to stay in god presence in the midst of busyness 
how good to let providence guide you step by step 11 she advised her oblate sisters 
from the moment she followed god will for her and consented to begin the congregation of the oblate sisters of st francis de sales her days were filled with multitude of activities the young working girls 
needed the constant attention of the sisters to supervise and guide them in their factory work the boarders needed the daily maternal care of the sisters in preparing the meals running the house and managing 
funds when sometimes not even sow could be found in the convent purse 
even sunday the proverbial day of rest was devoted to the sunday clubs with the sisters providing the girls with games activities and time together this constant devotedness to the working girls and the 
boarders to managing the newly founded schools and to organizing the sunday clubs left our saint with little leisure time for herself how did leonie aviat fare in the midst of all this busyness 
she like francis de sales learned to use the countless unforeseen events that thwart the planned agenda of each day as little stepping stones to greater union with god 
she mastered the wonderful spiritual secret of spinning straw into gold by taking the very things that could annoy or aggravate and transforming them into events fertile with holiness by surrendering them 
gently to god she followed st francis de sales ideal of sanctifying each present moment and instructing her sisters to live in the present moment in order to receive all the graces which it brings 

we must make serious effort to train our hearts to stay focused and centered in the midst of busy activities practicing gentle surrender to all the happenings of the day 

so what is the great secret of walking gentle prayerful path we must make serious effort to train our hearts to stay focused and centered in the midst of busy activities practicing gentle surrender to all the 
happenings of the day 

has not jesus himself challenged us to this gentleness he even offers himself as model learn of me that am gentle of heart and you will find rest for your souls matthew 11 28 29 

and so let us learn like francis de
sales and mother aviat to turn all the little daily annoyances the traffic jam the delayed air flight the impatient clerk the lost keys into grace filled moments when our hearts turn briefly to god to calmly 
surrender all of this into his hands holding our hearts gently in his presence one step at time 
finding your niche 
what does it mean to be follower of jesus 
what is the state of life in which find myself 
what is the stage of life in which find myself 
how might be called to follow jesus at this point in my life 
how might be called to practice devotion at this point in my life 
how might the voice of god be speaking to me in the circumstances events and relationships of my every day life 
what do believe to be my niche at this point in my life 

god dream for you 
ray kinsella is the main character in the movie field of dreams 1989 whose world is turned upside down when he hears voice telling him if you build it he will come and build it he does that and so much more 
but near the end of the film it is 
someone else the character thomas mann who is asked to join the baseball players beyond the field ray is understandably upset and when he asks the ghost of shoeless joe jackson why he can join them the ghost 
simply but firmly responds you re not invited imagine how john the baptist must have felt as st francis de sales wrote john spent twenty five years in the desert without coming to see jesus even once then 
after baptizing jesus he does not get to follow him but stays behind to accomplish his appointed task stopp selected letters page 74 
all of us are called to follow jesus
but not in the same way john wasn invited to join jesus that invitation was extended to others john way of following jesus as it turned out was to stay home and to lead others to jesus 
to be sure all of us are called to follow jesus to live as christ lived however not all of us are called to follow jesus in the same way consider chapter nine of matthew gospel in one scene verse jesus heals 
paralytic telling him to pick up your mat and go home by contrast when he encounters matthew verse jesus says follow me 
using the language of the salesian tradition while all of us are called to live devout life each of us is called to do that in ways that fit the state and stage of life in which god has placed us in his 
introduction to the devout life francis
each of us is called to live devout life in ways that fit the state and stage of life in which god places us 
wrote devotion must be exercised in different ways by the gentleman the worker the servant the prince the widow the young girl and the married woman not only is this true but the practice of devotion must be 
adapted to the strength activities and duties of each particular person part one chapter 
in part two of the introduction francis observed among god servants some dedicate themselves to serve the sick others to help the poor others to spread knowledge of christian doctrine among children others to 
reclaim souls lost and gone astray others to beautify churches and decorate others others to restore peace and concord among other people 
to be sure some people are called to follow jesus by leaving behind all that is familiar some people are called to practice devotion by undertaking some special ministry half world away some people are called 
to follow jesus by giving their life for the gospel 

for most of us however following jesus is about staying home for most of us following jesus is about seeing all that is familiar with new eyes for most of us practicing devotion is about entering more deeply 
into our relationships with family neighbors coworkers and friends for most of us growing in our love for god and others is about lovingly tending to the fields of dreams which are the circumstances and events 
of everyday life 
in that respect the movie field of dreams is about finding your niche 
following jesus is about tending our own unique fields of dreams 
for one person it was about forsaking baseball for career in medicine for writer it was about venturing into the unknown to get the story of lifetime for another it was about growing in his love for his wife 
his daughter and the opportunity to be at peace with the spirit of his father 

francis de sales wrote we must stay in our own ship to make the journey from this life to the next stopp selected letters 251 for each of us following jesus is about finding our unique god given niche in life 
and sticking to it 
seasons of the soul 

how much change do experience in my life 
how comfortable am with change do deal well with change why 
do deal poorly with changes in my life are there any feelings or moods that find especg one day never exactly resembles another some days are cloudy some rainy some dry some windy variety gives great beauty 
to the universe ially frustrating or problematic why 
how much confidence and trust do have in god no matter how my heart is 
where might need to grow more comfortable with the seasons of my soul 
in what in whom do place my trust 

the need for confidence 
in the fourth book of his introduction to the devout life chapter 13 st francis de sales begins with the following observation god keeps this wonderful world in existence amidst constant change thus day passes 
into night spring into summer summer into autumn autumn into winter and winter into sprin
it is the same with us francis continues 
we are never in the same state our lives flow on earth like the water that surges and swirls in perpetual diversity of movements sometimes we are lifted up by hope sometimes cast down by fear
sometimes bent to the right by joys sometimes to the left by sorrow not one day nor one hour is exactly the same 
indeed how diverse how fluid and how varied are the seasons of the human heart of the human mind and of the human soul in so many ways heraclitus greek philosopher 500 was right when he said that the only 
constant is change 
these seasons of the soul challenge us in two ways 
we need to accept embrace and learn from all of the seasons of our lives 
and we nevertheless need to find some source of constancy in order to effectively deal with the changing tides of the ocean within us that is our thoughts feelings and attitudes 
st francis offered advice regarding the former in letter to st jane de chantal letters of spiritual direction 148 written in 1608 you would like it to be always spring or summer but no you have to experience 
interior as well as exterior changes only in heaven will everything be springtime as to beauty autumn as to enjoyment and summer as to love there will be no winter there but here below we need winter so that 
we may practice self denial and the countless small but beautiful virtues that can be practiced during barren season 
just as every season of the year plays in our particular role in god plan for our world so too all the seasons of the heart have their place to play in god plan of salvation for us joy sadness success setback 
faith fear anxiety confidence all can teach us something more of who we are and who god calls us to be 
who wouldn always like to be happy and fulfilled who wouldn like to avoid sadness and emptiness nevertheless every season of the soul has its own voice that needs to be heard 
where can we hope to find the stability to deal with the seasons of the soul francis de sales wrote we must try to keep constant and unchanging mind though everything turns and changes about us and within us 
we must always remain firm our eyes fixed on god seeking god and moving towards god whether we are in sadness or joy in consolation or bitterness in peace or in trouble in light or in darkness in temptation or 
tranquility in liking or disgust 
take confidence in god unchanging love for us 
in dryness or warmth scorched by the sun or refreshed by the dew yet the highest point of our heart like the compass of ship should always be turned to god our creator and our savior our unique and sovereign 
good 

our spiritual path may be filled with uncertainty god’ plan for us may be full of surprises some consoling some maddening our minds our hearts our lives may not be as calm or predictable as we might like 

the challenge for us is to believe that in all and every season of the soul it is the same loving god who creates us redeems us and inspires us to take confidence in god constant unchanging and eternal love 
for us 
the power 

which of the qualities of happy healthy and holy conversation above most appeal to you 
which of the qualities of happy healthy and holy conversation above least appeal to you 
which dimension do you believe you do the best 
which dimension do you believe you need to develop the most 
are there any you would add 
why or why not 
on scale of one to ten how would you rate your communication skills at this point in your life 

of words and mean spirit 

whether in public or private speak from your heart speak from your soul mild should it be necessary to contradict anyone or oppose another opinion we must do it in ways that do not inflame the other temper 
says francis de sales nothing is ever gained by harshness or again correction is naturally bitter but when mixed with the sugar of loving kindness and warmed by the 
fire of charity it becomes more acceptable gracious even cordial not a mess 

where you practice this gentleness is just as important as how when you need to correct someone it is better to put it off little and make the correction in private and with kindness observes 
st jane de chantal in addition do so without nagging 
whether in conflict or correction keep it short and sweet 
unaffected say what you mean mean what you say st jane de chantal writes let there be nothing in your manner of speaking or writing that smacks of affectation in truth 
would rather have you appear unskilled than be considered affected mess 

the more straightforward the better 
sincere say what needs to be said in as genuine manner as possible st francis de sales remarks fidelity plainness and sincerity of speech are assuredly great ornament of christian life for st jane de chantal 

how do you strike the balance between your work and recreation 
how much time do you actually take each year each week each day to deal with tension to address your stress to prevent burnout 
how faithful are you to refreshing your body 
how faithful are you to refreshing your mind 
how faithful are you to refreshing your heart 
how faithful are you to refreshing your soul 
are there any changes that you need to make at this time in your life to have better balance between work and play 
no way 

all work and no play makes jack dull boy 
not only might it make jack dull it might cripple his attempts to be happy healthy and even holy 
make no mistake growing in holiness making real in our own lives the love of the god in whose image and likeness we are created is serious business it requires hard work it requires discipline 
it is actually defect to be so strict austere and unsociable that one never permits oneself recreation time 
it requires self examination it requires commitment 
as francis de sales would say it requires devotion 
but salesian spirituality also recognizes the value of relaxation of taking time out of catching your breath of making time for play in fact relaxation is not only permissible it is necessary francis de sales 
claims it is actually defect to be so strict austere and unsociable that one neither permits oneself nor others any recreation time 
the introduction to the devout life 1609 contains ample evidence of the gentleman saint appreciation of the important role that recreation plays in the pursuit of fully human god centered life he says from 
time to time we must recreate in mind and body 
he continues to take the air to go for walk to enjoy friendly chat to play music or sing or hunt are such honest diversions that the only thing needed to utilize them well is simple prudence which gives to all 
things their rank time place and measure 
to be balanced we need to know our limitations st jane once wrote in the context of letter to member of her community must run for have little leisure and my arm and hand are starting to tire and hurt even 
though ve just begun to write not able to do as much as used to 
 from time to time we must recreate in mind and body 
in his book touching the ordinary robert wicks identifies practices that can help us establish and maintain balanced life get enough sleep eat right practice leisure pace yourself learn to laugh focus on 
values practice self appreciation be involved but not too involved have support group escape on occasion be spontaneous avoid negativity establish good friendships practice intimacy 
of course there are also the spiritual practices pray participate in the life of the church celebrate the sacraments read scripture and other material that nourishes the soul 
our lord jesus christ spent virtually his entire public ministry meeting the needs of others healing teaching feeding challenging forgiving in short working but the gospels that document christ work ethic also 
clearly document those times when he withdrew from his activities to rest to renew to enjoy an other hospitality to spend time with friends all helpful in rededicating himself to doing the will of god 
how faithful are you to refreshing your body mind heart and soul 
there are plenty of ways to achieve balance between work and play livelihood and leisure pay and play consider them in personal prayerful manner choose those consistent with the state and stage of life in 
which you find yourself at this time realize that as your life changes so too may your means for achieving this happy healthy and holy balance 

as you travel along the highway of life take your foot off the gas sometimes ride with the windows down pullover on occasion use the rest stop check out the scenic overlooks balancing work and play will not 
only help you to reach your destinations in one piece but it will actually enable you to really enjoy the trip 
anger 

what is your experience of anger 
are there situations or issues in your life that tap into your anger more than others if so what are they what steps might you take to understand why these things tend to push 
your buttons more readily than others 
how successful are you at naming and managing your anger 
what strategies might you employ for getting better handle on your anger 
are there any relationships in your life that have been damaged by anger are there any steps you can take to repair the damage 
yea 
volatile subject 

ever been angry of course you 
have anger is fact of life 
sometimes volatile fact of life 
like any emotion it cannot be denied or suppressed nor should it be recklessly unbridled it needs to be understood 
anger is not sinful however how we deal with it or fail to deal with it can have sinful results 
it is better to attempt to find way to live without anger rather than pretend to make moderate or discreet use of it 
we seldom plan to grow angry anger is an intense response or reaction to an injury or injustice either actual or perceived as such it often catches us off guard 
herein lies the difficulty precisely because of its spontaneity and intensity anger can quickly get the upper hand…and get out of hand anger is as it were an uninvited guest that can quickly become the master 
of the house once admitted it is with difficulty driven out again it enters as little twig and in less than no time it grows big and becomes abeam 
francis de sales counsels us it is better to attempt to find way to live without anger rather than pretend to make moderate or discreet use of it as long as reason rules and peaceably exercises chastisements 
or corrections people can approve and receive them however when accompanied by anger or rage this same reason is feared rather than loved 

when it comes to anger don try to fight fire with fire 
 
jane de chantal suggests try to calm your passions and live according to sound reason and the holy will of god 
it is better to let anger cool before making decision or taking some action 
unbridled anger can be very destructive sometimes however the ways in which we react to being angry are worse than the anger itself many are greatly to blame who on being overcome by anger are angry for being 
angry in so doing they keep their hearts drenched and steeped in anger francis de sales continues it frequently happens that by endeavoring with violence to restrain our anger we stir up more trouble in our 
heart and being thus agitated the heart is no longer master of itself 
when is comes to anger don fight fire with fire 
still we all fail in this regard despite our best efforts we make decisions take actions and speak words in anger hurting others and ourselves in the process 
what can we do to repair the damage as soon as you perceive yourself guilty of an act of wrath repair it immediately by an act of kindness toward the person with whom you were angry as they say wounds are most 
easily cured when they are still fresh 
repeatedly indulging in anger can lead to tragic results when we brood over injuries when we revisit old hurts when we hold onto resentment anger ceases to be simply an emotion it becomes way of life 

avoid acting in anger avoid speaking in anger above all avoid wallowing in anger 

heed these words from the book of sirach wrath and anger are hateful things yet the sinner hugs them tight should person nourish anger against others and expect healing from the lord as stone falls back upon 

for holy living 

salesian spirituality is optimistic it affirms the innate god given dignity of each person it believes in the possibility of living happy healthy and holy life 
salesian spirituality is relational growing in holiness does not occur in vacuum rather striving for christian perfection always takes place within the context of our relationship with god ourselves and one 

blessed are hearts that bend for they shall never be broken 
fifth live in the present don dwell in the past don obsess about the future carpe diem that is seize today and master the moment to advance well st francis de sales recommends we must apply ourselves to make 
good way on the road nearest to us and to do today journey 
sixth roll with the punches pick your battles be steadfast on principle but flexible in detail blessed are hearts that bend observes st francis de sales for they shall never be broken 
seventh do little simple things well why wait for some one time opportunity to do one great thing and risk missing the countless opportunities each day to perform simpler ones with great attention passion and 
zeal we cannot always offer god great things says st jane de chantal but at each instant we can offer little things with great love 
eighth remain focused on your own happiness health and holiness you can give what you don have we can be so concerned about others welfare that we neglect our own st francis de sales 

we cannot always offer god 
great things but at each moment we can offer little things with great love 

cautions us do not sow crops of good intentions in your neighbor garden rather cultivate your own with diligence 
ninth strive for balance avoid extremes salt and sugar are both excellent things claims st francis de sales but too much of either spoils the dish food for thought 

finally make and maintain good friendships don be lone ranger seek out others in friendship who can support you encourage you understand you and challenge you in your desire to grow in happiness health and 
holiness the book of sirach 16 says it best faithful friend is the medicine of life and of immortality 
 
recalling god’ presence 

what are common occasions in which can achieve good on typical day 
what are some common occasions of temptation or sin for me on typical day 
how well do plan each day how well do remain centered in god presence when my plans for the day go awry 
am grateful for the times that am able to remember god presence throughout the day 
what are some ways that can recall god presence that fit into my daily routine 

throughout the day 

all this took place to fulfill what the lord had said through the prophet the virgin shall be with child and give birth to son and they shall call him immanuel name that means god with us matt 22 23 
immanuel god with us god who is always with us god who is with us all ways yet why is it that god sometimes seems so distant so illusive so remote does god forget us 
no god can never forget us however we can forget god…and we frequently do 

consider that god gives you this new day to bring you closer to eternity 

salesian spirituality offers us practical approach for recalling god presence throughout the day rather than look for god who dwells in faraway place this spiritual recollection us that god dwells precisely 
where we find ourselves in the rhythm of each day 
first upon waking embrace the gift of new day thanking god for having preserved you doing the preceding night 
second consider that god gives you this new day to bring you one step closer to eternity intend to make good use of this new day 
third foresee what business what affairs and what situations for serving god you will encounter on this day says st francis de sales and to what temptations of offending god you will be exposed in other words 
plan your day anticipate the opportunities that you will have for accomplishing some good be aware of those circumstances in which you may be tempted to do otherwise 
fourth resolve to do your best in embracing this new day both those experiences that 
 ask for god grace and make new start 
you anticipate and those that may surprise you acknowledge your need for god grace to accomplish good and to avoid evil this day 
fifth during the day retire into the solitude of your heart while you are outwardly engaged in business or association with others says francis de sales in short stay centered simple movements of the mind or
heart in the midst of any activity achieve this 
sixth make brief exanimation of conscience at midday are you living out your resolutions for living the day well ask for god grace to continue your efforts have you been less than successful so far ask for god 
grace and make anew start 
seventh make more detailed examination of conscience at the end of the day thank god for having preserved you during the day examine your actions and attitudes give thanks to god for what was good ask for 
forgiveness for that which was sinful 
finally ask god to protect you during the night to give you restful sleep and to help you embrace tomorrow with renewed enthusiasm and zeal 
as practical and powerful as these practices are you should not spend inordinate amounts of time upon them rather says st francis de sales they must be made briefly and fervently 
perhaps st jane de chantal best describes the kind of awareness and attitude that these practices seek to establish as for the will of god good pleasure which we know only through 
lovingly unite your will to the divine the events of life as they occur if these events benefit us we must bless god and unite ourselves to the divine will which sends them if something occurs which is 
disagreeable physically or mentally let us lovingly unite our will in obedience to the divine will which sends it 

by approaching the rhythms of each day with prayerful outlook and intention our daily triumphs and tragedies do not obscure the presence of god no they become the very places in which we encounter the divine

flexible life 
author scott peck md opens his book the road less traveled with simple yet universal truth 
life is difficult 
why what makes life difficult is that the process of confronting or dealing with life challenges is painful one challenges depending on their nature evoke in us frustration or grief or sadness or 
loneliness or guilt or regret or anger or fear or anxiety or anguish or despair 

discipline is the basic set of tools we require to deal 

since life poses an endless series of challenges life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy 
the temptation to avoid life challenges to turn away from opportunities for growth that can be found in grief or loss the desire to withdraw from the world the desire to withdraw from ourselves 
what do we need to counter this temptation 
discipline 
dr peck asserts discipline is the basic set of tools we require to deal with life challenges 
now be honest when you hear the word discipline you think rigid lock step inflexible right 
well time to expand your definition extraordinary flexibility is required for successful living in all spheres of activity health demands an extraordinary capacity to flexibly strike and continually restrike 
delicate balance between conflicting needs goals duties responsibilities et cetera 
successful people are those who are ready for anything both that for which they plan as well as that which is unexpected 
this is the essence of discipline it all about knowing when to take hold and when to let go ultimately it about knowing how to do both 
health happiness and holiness ultimately rely upon being disciplined enough to be extraordinarily flexible it is truly kind of freedom st francis de sales observes the effects of this freedom are great inner 

this interior discipline this rolling with the punches this willingness to deal with life on life terms not ours will make you grow in perfection and detachment more than you can imagine observes st jane de 
chantal 
she writes to friend who in fact chose to scrap something into which he had invested much time and energy believe that it was god who inspired you not to go on with your original plan in this assure you you 
have certainly followed the true spirit of our blessed father francis de sales for as you know he wished us to be courageous in our undertakings and flexible in letting them go when god in his good pleasure 
indicates that we should 
be courageous in your undertakings and flexible in letting them go… 
the words of country song come to mind you ve got to know when to hold em know when to fold em know when to walk away know when to run 
what gift the ability to pursue what we have planned for life the ability to accept what life has planned for us the ability to do both 
that discipline that flexibility that freedom 
that very good news 
what is 
do you believe that you are good 
what does being holy look or feel like to you 
are there any dimensions of salesian spirituality as outlined in this brochure that you find particularly nourishing or attractive 
what aspects of salesian spirituality as outlined in this brochure do you find most challenging or confrontational 
how might god be calling you to live jesus at this stage of your life 
salesian spirituality 

it is way of living the gospel as learned lived and shared by st francis de sales 1567 1622 and st jane de chantal 1572 1641 its first disciples were the sisters of the visitation of holy mary community of 
contemplative women established by these two saints in 1610 their vision continues today lived by people of all walks states and stages of life one cannot hope to adequately plumb the depths of this 
spirituality in brief pamphlet what follows are some of the more salient features of salesian spirituality 
god is love and all creation is an outpouring of that love all creation has been made for christ with christ and through christ 
all creation should be treated with respect and care jesus is the model for all fully human living 
you possess divine dignity and are thus worthy of profound respect god has testified that you are good worthy of divine love and mercy 
despite your weakness and sinfulness god loves you so much that god sent his only son to become human 
you are called to be holy that is to grow in union with god 
pursuing holy life is called devotion that is doing what is both commanded and counseled by god promptly actively and diligently 
the pursuit of holiness must be practical it must transform your attitudes attributes and actions 
acknowledge your sins and failing learn from them but do not dwell on them 
god gives you talents and abilities gifts that should be discovered developed and used for the good of others 
relationships are essential to living fully human that is holy life 
each moment of each day comes from the hand of loving god and is graced for your salvation the only time you have is each present moment don live in the past don dwell on the future 
living each moment to the fullest with an eye to loving god must lead you to show compassion for others 
the challenge of each moment is discerning god will that is the particular unique way that god may be calling you to love god yourself and others god will is frequently communicated through the events 
circumstances and relationships in which you find yourself 
god seldom requires you to perform great or extraordinary feats 
god always challenges you to perform everyday actions with extraordinary attention and enthusiasm he little virtues of patience humility gentleness simplicity honesty and hospitality are powerful means for 
growing in holiness 
all prayer and meditation must lead to action 
the motivation with which you perform some action may be far more important and powerful than the action itself 
freedom is one of the most precious and powerful gifts that god gives you you are to use that freedom to grow in conformity to god will 
intellectual learning prayerful reflection social interaction work play and all things creative should be valued as graced by god and viewed as means for growing into fully human person each new day is anew 
beginning new opportunity for growing in holiness 
let your passion be disciplined 
let your discipline be passionate keep things in perspective 
develop sense of humor 

welcome to salesian spirituality 
may it help you to become holy whole human person may it enable you to live jesus to allow jesus to live in you and to love through you 
 
they shall possess the earth 
on scale of one to ten how gentle am 
how am tempted to overreact to things and people in life 
how am tempted to under react to things and people in life 
how gentle am in the face of my own sins faults and imperfections 
how gentle am in the face of others sins faults and imperfections 
how important or unimportant is it for me to get my way 
in what areas of my life might need to become more gentle 
do enjoy my life here on earth how aware and engaged am in each day hour and moment of life 
do treat myself and others with respect and reverence 

the gentle 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the gentle they shall inherit the 

about this virtue it is in fact one of the two great pillars of salesian spirituality drawn from the words of jesus who described himself as gentle humble of heart mt 11 29 
do not be over eager be careful to serve god with great gentleness for this is the right way of setting about god service do not want to do everything but only something and no doubt you will in fact do much 
how sweet is patience when compared with revenge gentleness compared with anger and vexation humility when compared with arrogance and ambition wrote st francis de sales gentleness perfects us with respect to 
 our neighbor it stands out among all the virtues as the flower of charity introduction to the devout life part chapter 11 part iii chapter 
this gentleness this respect this reverence for ourselves and others is rooted in humility which in turn is rooted in our relationship with god profound humility toward god should produce gentleness toward our 
 neighbors this in turn should foster kindliness of heart we should accommodate ourselves to others restraining our vigor to suit the pace of others conferences xiii pp 240 242 
the acid test of our gentleness is how we respond 0r react when others injure us if we are proud puffed up and enraged when we are stung and bitten by detractors and enemies it is sure sign that neither 
humility nor gentleness are genuine in us but only apparent and artificial introduction part iii chapter 
being gentle is about living with purpose and direction in ways that avoid both passivity and aggression either with regard to ourselves or others francis wrote do not be over eager be careful to serve god 
with great gentleness for this is the right way of setting about god service do not want to do everything but only something and no doubt you will in fact do much selected letters 135 
gentleness is rooted in humility in our relationship with god 
how does this enable us to inherit the earth by being gentle by being self disciplined by being self possessed we are better able to respond to life rather than react to it we can then truly take hold of lif find ourselves e 
as it is now and dream of how it might be with god grace in the days to come

sample files you can download sample files that relate to excerpts from microsoft office excel 2003 inside out
from microsoft office online this article uses the file treeorders xls 
although microsoft excel includes a multitude of built - in worksheet functions chances are it doesn ' t have a
function for every type of calculation you perform excel's designers couldn ' t possibly anticipate every calculation
need of every user but they did provide you with the ability to create your own custom functions in the same way
that a macro lets you encapsulate a sequence of actions execute that sequence with a single command a
custom function lets you encapsulate a sequence of calculations so that you can perform those calculations with
a single formula 
custom functions like macros use the visual basic for applications vba programming language they differ
from macros in two significant ways first they use function procedures instead of sub procedures they start
with a function statement instead of a sub statement and end with end function instead of end sub second 
they perform calculations instead of taking actions certain kinds of statements such as statements that select
and format ranges are excluded from custom functions in this article you learn how to create and use custom
functions 
getting started
suppose your company offers a quantity discount of 10 percent on the sale of a product provided the order is for
more than 100 units in the following paragraphs you ' ll build a function to calculate this discount 
figure 1 shows an order form that lists each item the quantity the price the discount if any and the resulting
extended price

creating custom functions - excel - office com page 1 of 6
http //office microsoft com/en - us/excel - help/creating - custom - functions - ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
figure 1 in column f we want to calculate the discount for each item ordered 
note the workbook used in this example treeorders xls is included in the sample files download 
to create a custom discount function in this workbook follow these steps 
press alt+f11 to open the visual basic editor vbe and then choose insert module a new module
appears as shown in figure 2 
1 
in the new module enter the following code to make the code more readable use the tab key to indent
lines the indentation is for your benefit only and is entirely optional the code will run with or without
indentation after you type an indented line the vbe assumes that your next line will be similarly indented to
move back out that is to the left one tab character press shift+tab 
2 
function discount quantity price 
if quantity >= 100 then
discount = quantity price 0 1
else
discount = 0
end if
discount = application round discount 2 
end function
figure 2 choosing insert module adds a new module to the workbook 
using custom functions
now you ' re ready to use the new discount function press alt+f11 to switch back to the worksheet shown in
figure 2 select cell f9 and enter =discount c9 d9 excel calculates the 10 percent discount on 200 units at
$47 50 per unit and returns $950 00 
creating custom functions - excel - office com page 2 of 6
http //office microsoft com/en - us/excel - help/creating - custom - functions - ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
in the first line of your vba code function discount quantity price you indicated that the discount function
would require two arguments quantity and price when you call the function in a worksheet cell you must include
those two arguments in the formula =discount c9 d9 c9 is the quantity argument and d9 is the price
argument now you can copy the discount formula into f10 f15 to get the worksheet shown in figure 3 
figure 3 this worksheet shows the result of the discount custom function 
what's happening
let's consider how excel interprets this function procedure when you press enter excel looks for the name
discount in the current workbook and finds that it is a procedure in module1 the argument names enclosed in
parentheses—quantity and price—are placeholders for the values on which the calculation of the discount is
based 
the if statement in the following block of code examines the quantity argument and determines whether the
number of items sold is greater than or equal to 100 
if quantity >= 100 then
discount = quantity price 0 1
else
discount = 0
end if
if the number of items sold is greater than or equal to 100 vba executes the following statement which
multiplies the quantity value by the price value and then multiplies the result by 0 1 
discount = quantity price 0 1
the result is stored as the variable discount a vba statement that stores a value in a variable is called an
assignment statement because it evaluates the expression on the right side of the equal sign and assigns the
result to the variable name on the left because the variable discount has the same name as the function
procedure the value stored in the variable is returned to the worksheet formula called the discount function 
if quantity is less than 100 vba executes the statement
discount = 0
finally the following statement rounds the value assigned to the discount variable to two decimal places 
discount = application round discount 2 
vba has no round function but excel does therefore to use round in this statement you tell vba to look for
the round method function in the application object excel you do that by adding the word application before
the word round use this syntax whenever you need to access an excel function from a vba module

http //office microsoft com/en - us/excel - help/creating - custom - functions - ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
understanding custom function rules
a custom function must start with a function statement and end with an end function statement in addition to
the function name the function statement usually specifies one or more arguments you may include as many as
29 arguments using commas to separate them you can also create a function with no arguments excel
includes several built - in functions—rand and now for example—that don ' t use arguments as you ' ll see
later in this chapter you can also create functions with optional arguments—arguments that you can either
include or omit when you call the function 
following the function statement a function procedure includes one or more vba statements that make
decisions and perform calculations using the arguments passed to the function finally somewhere in the
function procedure you must include a statement that assigns a value to a variable with the same name as the
function this value is returned to the formula that calls the function 
using vba keywords in custom functions
the number of vba keywords you can use in custom functions is smaller than the number you can use in
macros custom functions are not allowed to do anything other than return a value to a formula in a worksheet or
to an expression used in another vba macro or function for example custom functions cannot resize windows 
edit a formula in a cell or change the font color or pattern options for the text in a cell if you include action 
code of this kind in a function procedure the function returns the #value ! error 
the one action a function procedure can take apart from performing calculations is to display a dialog box you
can use an inputbox statement in a custom function as a means of getting input from the user executing the
function you can use a msgbox statement as a means of conveying information to the user you also can use
custom dialog boxes or userforms—a subject that is beyond the scope of this introduction 
documenting macros and custom functions
even simple macros and custom functions can be difficult to read you can make them easier to understand by
entering explanatory text in the form of comments you add comments by preceding the explanatory text with an
apostrophe for example figure 4 shows the discount function with comments adding comments like these
makes it easier for you or others to maintain your vba code as time passes if you need to make a change to the
code in the future you ' ll have an easier time understanding what you did originally 
figure 4 the discount custom function now includes comments 
an apostrophe tells excel to ignore everything to the right on the same line so you can place a comment to the
right of a vba statement you can also insert comments between the statements in a macro or custom function 
for example you might begin a relatively long block of code with a comment that explains its overall purpose and
then use inline comments to document individual statements 
another way to document your macros and custom functions is to give them descriptive names for example 
rather than name a macro labels you could name it relmonthlabels where rel indicates that the macro uses
relative references and monthlabels describes the type of label the macro creates using descriptive names for
macros and custom functions is especially helpful when you ' ve created many procedures particularly if you
create procedures that have similar but not identical purposes 
creating custom functions - excel - office com page 4 of 6
http //office microsoft com/en - us/excel - help/creating - custom - functions - ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
how you document your macros and custom functions is a matter of personal preference it doesn ' t matter which
method you use as long as you document them documentation is most important for long and complex
procedures for procedures that you look at only once in a while and for procedures that will be maintained by
other people 
creating custom functions with optional arguments
some of excel's built - in functions let you omit certain arguments for example if you omit the type and future
value arguments from the pv function excel still computes the result because those arguments are optional 
your custom functions can also make use of optional arguments 
for example suppose you want to create a custom function called righttriangle that uses the pythagorean
theorem to compute the length of any side of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides the
equation that expresses the pythagorean theorem is a2 + b2 = c2 in which a and b are the short sides and c is
the hypotenuse given any two sides you can use this equation to solve for the third side 
in a general - purpose triangle function you want to accept three arguments one for each side of the triangle but
make each argument optional so that the user of the function can omit the argument that the function should
solve for the following code does the trick 
function triangle optional side1 optional side2 _
optional hypotenuse 
if not ismissing side1 and not ismissing side2 then
triangle = sqr side1 ^ 2 + side2 ^ 2 
else
if not ismissing side1 and not ismissing hypotenuse then
triangle = sqr hypotenuse ^ 2 - side1 ^ 2 
else
if not ismissing side2 and not ismissing hypotenuse then
triangle = sqr hypotenuse ^ 2 - side2 ^ 2 
else
triangle = please supply two arguments 
end if
end if
end if
end function
the first statement names the custom function and the optional arguments side1 side2 and hypotenuse the
following block of code contains a series of if statements that use the vba ismissing function to test whether each
possible pair of arguments has been supplied and to calculate and return the length of the unknown side 
if not ismissing side1 and not ismissing side2 then
triangle = sqr side1 ^ 2 + side2 ^ 2 
this code tests for the presence of side1 and side2 the ismissing function returns true if the argument has not
been supplied if side1 is not missing and side2 is not missing excel computes the square root of the sum of the
squares of the two short sides and returns the length of the hypotenuse to the worksheet 
if fewer than two arguments are supplied the following statement returns a text string to the worksheet 
triangle = please supply two arguments 
now let's see what happens when we use this custom function in a worksheet formula the formula =triangle
 3 4 returns 5 
the hypotenuse argument is omitted so the function returns the square root of 32 + 42 you could also write
the formula =triangle 3 4 but the second comma is not necessary the formula =triangle 4 5 returns 3
because the side1 argument is omitted the formula =triangle 4 5 also returns 3 
the function as written has at least two flaws first if the user supplies all three arguments the function behaves
as though the third argument were omitted you might prefer to have it return an error message second the
creating custom functions - excel - office com page 5 of 6
http //office microsoft com/en - us/excel - help/creating - custom - functions - ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
function accepts negative and zero arguments even though triangles cannot have sides of negative or zero
length 
you can eliminate the first of these defects by adding the following if … end if block immediately after the
function statement 
if not ismissing side1 and not ismissing side2 and _
not ismissing hypotenuse then
triangle = please supply only two arguments 
exit function
end if
note that this block includes an exit function statement this saves the function the trouble of searching for
missing argument when it has already discovered that none are missing 
you can use a similar if … end if construction to check for arguments less than or equal to zero returning an
appropriate error message and exiting the function if any are found note that other kinds of inappropriate
arguments text for example will cause the function to return one of excel's built - in error constants if you call the
function and offer a text argument the function returns #value ! because it attempts to perform arithmetic
operations on a nonarithmetic value 
how much error trapping you add to your custom functions depends of course on how much work you want to
do and how you plan to use the function if you ' re writing a function for your personal use you might not need to
deal with every conceivable aberrant use if you write the function for others you ' ll probably want to eliminate all
possibility of error—or at least to try to do so 
making your custom functions available anywhere
to use a custom function the workbook containing the module in which you create the function must be open if
that workbook is not open you get a #name ? error when you try to use the function even if the workbook is
open if you use the function in a different workbook you must precede the function name with the name of the
workbook in which the function resides for example if you create a function called discount in a workbook called
personal xls and you call that function from another workbook you must write =personal xls ! discount not
simply =discount 
you can save yourself some keystrokes and possible typing errors by selecting your custom functions from the
insert function dialog box your custom functions appear in the user defined category an easier way to make
your custom functions available at all times is to store them in a separate workbook and then save that workbook
as an add - in an xla file in your xlstart folder the xlstart folder is a subfolder of the folder containing your
excel files when you start excel the program opens any documents it finds in xlstart to save a workbook as
an add - in choose file save as or file save then choose microsoft excel add - in from the files of type
list 
if your user - defined functions are stored in an xla file that is present in memory you don ' t have to specify the
name of that file when you call a function if the xla file is saved in your xlstart folder it will be present in
memory whenever you run excel

introduction
high - speed commercial aircraft require a surface treatment for titanium ti alloy that is
both environmentally safe and durable under the conditions of supersonic flight a
number of pretreatment procedures for ti alloy requiring multi - stages have been
developed to produce a stable surface among the stages are degreasing mechanical
abrasion chemical etching and electrochemical anodizing these treatments exhibit
significant variations in their long - term stability and the benefits of each step in these
processes still remain unclear in addition chromium compounds are often used in many
chemical treatments and these materials are detrimental to the environment recently a
chromium - free surface treatment for ti alloy has been reported [ 1 ] though not designed
for high temperature applications in the present study a simple surface treatment process
developed at nasa/larc [ 2 ] is reported offering a high performance surface for a
variety of applications this novel surface treatment for ti alloy is conventionally
achieved by forming oxides on the surface with a two - step chemical process without
mechanical abrasion this acid - followed - by - base treatment was designed to be cost
effective and relatively safe to use in a commercial application in addition it is
chromium - free and has been successfully used with a sol - gel coating to afford a strong
adhesive bond after exposure to hot - wet environments phenylethynyl containing
adhesives were used to evaluate this surface treatment with sol - gel solutions made of
novel imide silanes developed at nasa/larc [ 3 ] oxide layers developed by this
process were controlled by immersion time and temperature and solution concentration 
the morphology and chemical composition of the oxide layers were investigated using
scanning electron microscopy sem x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and
auger electron spectroscopy aes bond strengths made with this new treatment were
evaluated using single lap shear tests 
experimental
the adherends of primary interest in this study were ti - 6al - 4v alloy there were two
types shiny and dark ti - 6 - 4 the former was cleaner and processed with shorter
annealing time 15 min at 788ûc than the latter 45 min at 788ûc other metals studied
included aluminum and stainless steel acetone and methanol were used as solvents for
degreasing for all the metals alumina grit - blast and alkaline peroxide solution 1m
h2o2á0 5m naoh were used to prepare reference specimens the materials for the new
acid - base process were sulfuric acid solution 9m h2so4 and alkaline perborate
solution 0 5m nabo3á1m naoh as the acid etchant and oxidizing agent respectively 
sol - gel solutions were prepared prior to acid - base treatment [ 3 ] peti - 5áapeis/teos
and ppeids were used as the sol - gel solutions dipping was used for each treatment 
first after solvent degreasing the sulfuric acid was used to generate a fresh ti surface 
next an alkaline perborate solution was used to form an oxide on the surface ultrasonic
washing in distilled water was used between each treatment dipping time for each acid
and base treatment was varied in order to develop various surface morphologies the
principal dipping time was 10 min the sequence of the acid and base treatment was also
varied for examples acid - base and base - acid - base sequences were tried a sol - gel
solution was applied to the pretreated metals for 3 min immediately after drying them in
an oven at 100ûc for 10 min the sol - gel coated metals were placed in the oven at 110
and 220ûc for 30 min each 
single lap shear specimens were bonded at 371ûc under 50 psi for an hour using a
phenylethynyl containing imide adhesive tape fm - x5 cytec bond strengths of the lap
shear specimens were tested using astm d1002 an sem jms - 6400 xps 5400 - 
xps and aes 610 scanning auger system were used to analyze the surface
morphology and chemical composition polished sections of the ti - 6 - 4 alloys in an epoxy
molding resin were used for edx and x - ray mapping study using the sem 
results and discussion
fig 1 shows lap shear strengths for the specimens treated with the alkaline peroxide rt
for 10 min subsequent to the mechanical abrasion while the rt strength with only gritblast
did not exhibit resistance in the hot wet environment those with additional alkaline
peroxide treatment raised both initial and hot - wet strengths significantly this helps to
prove the efficacy of using an oxidizing agent alkaline peroxide to develop a durable
oxide layer against hostile environments although mechanical abrasion is desirable to
produce a rough and fresh surface there is a limit for this application to complex
substrates so that mechanical abrasion was replaced by sulfuric acid etching in addition 
alkaline peroxide was replaced by alkaline perborate to produce a safe and stable
oxidizing agent perborate eventually liberates hydrogen peroxide at temperatures up to
60ûc lap shear strengths with grit - blast/alkaline peroxide and sulfuric acid/alkaline
perborate treatments are compared in fig 2 the strengths are almost the same for both
treatments although the new acid - base treatment exhibits slightly better resistance in the
hot - wet environment lap shear strengths for grit - blast/pasa - jell treatment with a
phenylethynyl containing adhesive peti - 5 have also been reported which were 7110
psi rt strength and 5950 psi rt strength after a 3 - day water - boil [ 4 ]

ti - 6 - 4 alloy specimens subjected to the acid - base treatment with a variation in
time and temperature were analyzed using microscopy acid etching was fairly effective
in degreasing tacky contaminants and the degree of degreasing was proportional to
etching time according to optical microscopy examination it was difficult however to
quantify the degree of etching due to the intrinsic non - uniform contamination of the
metal on the other hand base treatment as an oxidizing agent was very successful in
developing a fresh oxide layer the thickness of the oxide layer increased with both time
and temperature round platelets < 2µm in diameter with a broad size distribution were
developed during the base treatment the shape and size of the platelets were most likely
dependent on the processing conditions of the ti alloys such as heat treatment rolling 
and cleaning the shiny ti - 6 - 4 treated with the alkaline perborate at rt 10 min produced
what appeared to be a single layer of the platelets with the periphery being more angular
compared to the dark ti - 6 - 4 which formed thicker and more round platelets the role of
the shape size and thickness of the platelets remains unknown a surface having a thick
oxide layer usually affords a thinner sol - gel coating compared to a nominal mono - layer
oxide surface this thicker oxide layer results in lower strengths essentially the same
trend was observed with temperature variation higher temperature 60ûc tended to
develop a non - uniform multi - layer oxide because perborate dissociates very rapidly into
hydrogen peroxide at 60ûc to become more reactive than at125 rt a 60ûc treatment of
the dark ti - 6 - 4 afforded 4254 psi rt strength and 4034 psi rt strength after a 3 - day
water - boil this was almost 40% lower strength than for the shiny cleaner ti - 6 - 4 
analyzing these data a 10 min exposure at rt in the perborate/base was selected as an
optimum condition 
aes depth profile revealed an oxygen peak at the interface between the metal and
sol - gel layer probably representing a fresh oxide layer developed during base treatment 
the thickness was less than 200 nm based on aes which corresponds to the value from
sem ca 150 nm this oxygen peak was also observed at an edx line map of a metal
treated by the alkaline perborate solution at rt for 10 min as shown in fig 4 x - ray
mapping of a metal treated by an acid - base process rt for 10 min illustrated that the
aluminum composition slightly increased while the titanium and vanadium vanished
rapidly at the outermost metal surface this is seen in fig 5 from which the interface of
the al map appeared distinct compared to the diffusive interfaces of the rest of the
sample this observation was further supported by edx line mapping it is speculated
that an oxide layer developed by the alkaline perborate has aluminum compounds such as
aluminum oxides which may provide a more durable interface after being chemically
bonded with silane groups of the sol gel layer

agent single lap shear specimens were prepared and tested an example of the tested
aluminum specimen is shown in fig 6 failure occurred in the metal rather than in the

conclusions
a simple surface pretreatment process for ti - 6 - 4 alloy was developed at nasa/larc to
meet requirements of high - speed commercial aircraft application this process may offer
both environmentally safe and durable bonding at low cost under the conditions of
supersonic flight this novel surface treatment for ti alloy is conventionally achieved
with a two - step chemical process without mechanical abrasion in addition it is
chromium - free and has been successfully used with a sol gel coating to afford a strong
adhesive bond it exhibits excellent durability for hot wet environments with
approximately 90% retention of initial strengths an oxide layer developed by this base
treatment can be controlled by time temperature and concentration the morphology and
chemical composition of the oxide layer was investigated which revealed formation of
aluminum oxide compounds it is expected that this process will establish a low cost and
high performance surface for not only high - speed commercial aircraft but also for other
commercial applications with any metal adherend

how long was she planning to leave him this way ? was it even possible for her to 
wake him she would jostled him after he collapsed to the ground while trying to 
move him into a more comfortable position , and he had not stirred . she could cut 
the vine and sever the connection but doing so might be as damaging to him as 
abruptly severing mia connection with meno had been to mia no she did not dare risk it 
so the answer was as long as it took she would wait did not mean she had to like it

not deliberately there was a lot of leakage from everyone when we first set up the

what he and the other prevos dubbed the quantum connection that existed between 
them for it went beyond any existing form of communication network or data 
transfer all the way to the cusp of consciousness sharing

as if the lashes were glued together . her eyes watered it stung but after 
considerable coaxing her eyelids opened a sliver  light seeped in through a 
hazy  glycerin coated filter  yet even with the haze her irises recoiled 
forcing her lids closed 
a little daunted she paused to take stock of her situation in other ways . she 
felt cool fabric beneath her palms and softness beneath her head , evidence she 
lay on a bed . not surprising . now that she listened more closely , there were 
noises , but nothing noteworthy . merely the sounds of living . 
she steeled herself and tried again , forcing her lids open and blinking rapidly to 
try to clear the gooey haze . 
it was so damn bright . but gradually blurry images solidified : the rail of a 
hospital bed ; a long window to her left ; beyond the bed , a closed door . 
as the harshness of the real world came 
disconnect from non-existing homegroup if you have used it .  frank : you probably do not need to worry about this 
2.1. all pc's : check network profile and network discovery and share settings 
sometimes this selection to change between private and public network profile is missing from settings / networks page . 
in that case profile must change by powershell . right click windows icon ( start button ) and open powershell ( admin ) 
and use following commands to get interface index number and change profile to private ( or public ) : get - net connection profile 
set - net connection profile - interface index < index number > - network category private 
2.2. all pc's : check network discovery and share settings 
3. all pc's : set start type to automatic and start following services that allow pc's to be visible on network . ( reboot ) 
push win key and type " services " , locate these services . 
- function discovery provider host 
- function discovery resource publication
- ssdp discovery
- upnp device host
4. setting shares .
4.1. check your current shares .
open file explorer and type \ localhost to address bar to see what shares are made in this computer .
4.2. create new share ( here i use folder " test " ) .
( setting " turn on sharing so anyone … " in step 2.2. make share for folders in c: users automatic . )
folder is now shared and network share path is : \ pcnametest
4.3. safe way to share folders .
create user account to all users on your network to whom you want to give access to shared resources .
use same user id and password which they have on their own computers .
right click " test " and open properties and select security tab to see current settings .
default security settings are shown in next picture .
those settings allow access to shared folders only for those users who have user id on that computer .
image
4.4. sharing folder " test " to everyone " ( very unsafe setting ! think carefully do you need to select this ! )
if you want that everyone have access to that share then go to security tab and :
- click edit
- on permission dialog click add .
- new dialog open and you can add " everyone " to that list
- when back to permissions dialog select which rights you want to give to " everyone " .
now anyone on your home network should have access to shared folders without credentials or having user account on your computer .
5. now when click network on file explorer all your pc's should be visible in computer and network sections .
this should be cover the essentials to sharing your data over local network . this share is not limited to c: users folder , every folder can be handled like shown in steps 4 .
now your pc's should visible , but if not then try to reset all network settings :
go to settings / network & internet / status , scroll down to find " network reset , on next window click " reset now " button .
it will takes about 5 min to perform this reset and then pc reboot automatic .
when you sign in first time you get notification something like " do you want your pc to be access by other computers " , click yes for that .

guide to etching specialty alloys 
specialty alloys with high resistance to corrosion have challenged many laboratories to refine the way they etch alloy samples for microstructural evaluation the big problem is that the 
alloys resist the etchants just as they do the corrosive conditions encountered in service 
katharine b small david a englehart and todd a christman

etching superalloys in preparation for microscopic examination is extremely challenging because of their inherent corrosion resistance over the years carpenter engineers have developed 
guidelines for the most effective procedures for etching a wide range of iron nickel and cobaltbase alloy systems the following discussion offers guidelines for processing stainless steels 
high temperature alloys tool and alloy steels and magnetic and expansion alloys 
etchant selection selection of the proper etchant depends largely upon alloy composition heat treatment and processing the etchants for metallographic examination are solutions of acids and 
other chemicals that are applied selectively to attack a highly polished surface thus permitting microstructural examination three basic methods have been developed to etch alloy samples 
immersion the sample is immersed in the etching solution until the preferred structure is developed samples may be immersed in stain etchants to highlight specific microstructural features 
swabbing the sample is swabbed with cotton that has been immersed in the etchant electrolytic etching a dc source or a rectifier serves as the power supply and the specimen acts as the 
anode in the electrolytic cell power requirements can be adjusted as needed member of asm international 
depending on sample size anodetocathode spacing and electrolyte etchant rules 
the following rules should be observed to reveal a true and representative microstructure 
1
 if the specimen is mounted an adherent mount is very important separation between the specimen and the mounting compound can result in bleeding of the residual etchant or water and subsequent staining 2 
a good metallographic polish is a must the sample must be free of scratches disturbed metal and any kind of embedded contaminants 3
 the specimen must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before etching oil and any polishing compounds must be removed 4 yea 
after etching the sample should be rinsed in hot water followed by an alcohol rinse and should then be dried under hot air note an alcohol rinse can dull wash out a stain etch samples 
with cracks must be thoroughly dried to prevent bleeding 5
 if additional etching time is required the specimen should be rerubbed for a few seconds on a final polishing wheel if this is not done flashing can develop in certain alloys necessitating 
a complete repolish however flashing does not develop and rerubbing is not required if the alloy being etched forms no passive oxide layer or if the specimen is etched electrolytically 
rerubbing is usually mandatory only with alloys requiring the use of ralph’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia and hcl + h2o2 etchants morecomplete specimen preparation instructions are readily 
available in the literature etchants and alloys 
table 1 lists 28 common etchants along with their compositions and guidelines table 2 lists various specialty alloys suggested etchants for each and application notes these tables can 
help you to quickly select the appropriate etching procedure for a particular alloy additional etchants are reported in astm specification e40799 standard practice for microetching metals

progressively more aggressive formulations if a weaker etchant is tried first and it does not yield satisfactory results the investigator need only buff the surface slightly to return a good 
polish for examination with a stronger etchant 
on the other hand if the first etchant attempted is too strong far more preparation is required to restore the surface to a workable condition therefore it is usually good practice to start 
with the weakest solution 
reasons for etching 
if the intent is to evaluate nonmetallic inclusions and sulfide distribution morphology the sample is best examined in the aspolished condition the reason is that etching can remove various 
inclusions and attack structures such as ferrite stringers in an austenitic matrix 
however if the search is designed to examine grain structure precipitation or coldwork deadvanced materials & processes february 2008

formation the sample must be etched 
the condition of an alloy and its heat treatment also must be considered in the selection and application of etchants therefore even if the alloy grade and analysis are known it is 
important to know whether it has been annealed aged cold worked tempered and or is in the ashardened condition 
corrosionresistant alloys 
special techniques are required to effectively prepare highly corrosion resistant alloys for microstructural examination prominent in this group are alloys such as biodur ccm plus 
alloy mp35n alloy mp35n is a registered trademark of sps technologies inc and custom age 625 plus alloy uns n07716 
because these nickelbase and cobaltbase alloys have superior corrosion resistance they should be etched with waterless kalling’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia or ralph’s if these do not 
work hcl + h2o2 may be suitable in any case these alloys usually should be etched slowly 
all require a fresh polish to avoid flashing which would require a complete repolish best results are achieved by lightly rerubbing one or two samples at a time on the final polishing 
wheel normally a 005micron alumina slurry 
the challenge with these alloys is to offset their natural tendency to selfpassivate rapidly in the presence of oxygen therefore to effectively process these grades specimens must be etched 
immediately after final polishing they should be rinsed dried and etched without delay 
when etching these highly resistant alloys the etchant should be prepared in advance of the polishing process this advance planning will minimize the length of time between polishing and 
etching thus permitting a more effective microstructural evaluation 
stainless steels duplex structures are to be examined then glyc
austenitic ferritic precipitation hardenable eregia should be applied and for a shorter time and martensitic stainless steels should be etched ferritic ralph’s reagent normally provides 
with various reagents to reveal features of interest a good etch for general structures in ferritic stain
austenitic when etching austenitic stainless less steels waterless kalling’s and glyceregia also steels particularly annealed material that concan yield good results even after a good polish 
tains few grain boundary precipitates dic illuscratches may still be visible they may or may mination better shows the grain structure and not be a problem helps find coldwork deformation 
waterless precipitation hardenable ralph’s is usually kalling’s reagent reveals the general structure best for the precipitation hardenable stainless of many austenitic stainless alloys 
steels however vilella’s reagent will work fine if 
other agents such as glyceregia or acetic glyca light etch is preferred etching time varies beeregia may be required to reveal retained ferrite cause the alloy in the aged condition reacts 
more and carbide precipitation quickly to the etchant the higher the aging tem
if the only goal is to determine grain structure perature the quicker the response an alloy aged in an austenitic stainless the etching process at 1100°f 590°c etches darker and more quickly 
should start with a more aggressive etchant howthan one aged at 900°f 480°c ever if features other than grain boundaries such the annealed structure in ph stainless steels as carbides ferrite 
stringers second phases and requires either an aggressive etchant for a short 
microscopy methods five light microscopy methods of illumination are suitable for microstructural examination table 3 
 brightfield illumination 
 darkfield illumination 
 oblique illumination 
 differential interferencecontrast dic 
 polarized light 
dic using brightfield microscopes that change the way light is deflected gives a threedimen
sional image the brightfield image is changed by inserting a beam splitting prism polarizer + analyzer to separate and recombine the image to provide a threedimensional effect 
this is the ultimate in light optical microscopy showing grain boundaries very clearly in highly 
corrosionresistant alloys it is the most effective means of showing relief in structures and is capable of identifying the effects of cold work and mechanical damage compared with the other 
methods dic provides increased image contrast the wellequipped laboratory should have all 
five because their capabilities are complementary their role in microstructural evaluation cannot 
be overestimated darkfield oblique and differential interferencecontrast illumination methods can aid in delineating grain boundaries and other microstructural features that are only weakly visible in bright 
field illumination a polarizing filter can be used in conjunction with a stain etch to enhance color 
contrast in darkfield microscopy the grain seen is dark and the grain boundaries light with the bright
field microscope the grain is light and the boundaries dark oblique illumination shines light at an 
angle on the surface producing shadows on microstructural features 
table 3 — light optical microscopy methods 
method description 
brightfield illumination the most commonly encountered method of illumination in which the light reflection 
is perpendicular to the specimen being viewed generally microstructural features such 
as grain boundaries are dark and matrix regions are bright 
darkfield illumination the light is obliquely reflected back through the objective so that what appears bright 
and dark in brightfield illumination is reversed in darkfield illumination 
oblique illumination the illustration source is decentered at an oblique angle producing shadows on 
microstructural features this method is extremely helpful if the operator knows the 
illumination direction thereby knowing which features are raised and which are recessed 
by the shadow orientation 
differential a beamsplitting prism polarizer and analyzer are inserted into the light path producing 
interferencecontrast shadowing variations that reveal height differences in the microstructural features 
 dic 
polarized light the light is passed through a polarizing filter and can be adjusted to enhance the color 
contrast obtained with stain etchants 
36 advanced materials & processes february 2008 time or a less aggressive etchant for a longer time for example ralph’s reagent would etch in a few seconds or vilella’s which is less 
aggressive would etch more slowly 
martensitic vilella’s reagent is preferred for martensitic stainless steels etching time and response vary depending on whether the alloy has been annealed hardened or tempered annealed 
samples usually require the longest etching time because everything is in solution with not much to be seen 
it is best to stop etching while the specimen is still on the light side etching has gone too long when the sample starts going black a little experience will help the examiner to stop 
etching at the right time hardened and tempered samples usually require less etching time than annealed stock 
hightemperature alloys 
etching procedures for hightemperature alloys can vary greatly depending on condition of the material and what type of evaluation is required hightemperature alloys are typically more difficult 
to etch than austenitic stainless steels because they exhibit different aging conditions with a range of aging responses phases and precipitates 
if uncertain about which etchant to use start with glyceregia and increase in severity until the required structure is revealed this procedure requires only the final polishing step between etchants 
instead of a complete repolish glyceregia should be mixed at time of use as it becomes more aggressive with the passage of time 
waterless kalling’s another choice works well with alloys such as waspaloy uns n07001 pyromet alloy 718 uns n07718 and pyromet alloy a286 uns k66286 it can be stored and is thus more convenient than glyceregia 
stain etchants and electrolytic etchants can show specific aspects of structure in hightemperature alloys stain etchants used with immersion techniques have been effective in highlighting structural 
features such as second phases 
if the etchants for hightemperature alloys do not work hcl + h2o2 may be suitable just as they are for stainless steels precipitation can be evaluated via brightfield microscopy but dic is better for 
showing grain structure 
other alloy families 
tool and alloy steels nital 2 to 5% is useful for showing carbide structure in tool and alloy steels but reetching the treated sample afterward with vilella’s darkens the matrix and provides a 
clearer view of the microstructure many times samples can be etched with nital examined and then etched with vilella’s without repolishing alloy condition will determine etching time 
magnetic and expansion alloys most magnetic and expansion alloys can be treated as suggested for one of the stainless steel families or the tool and alloy steels for example nife alloys should be 
prepared by the procedures for austenitic stainless steels many of the alloys exploited for their dc magnetic properties such as stainless type 430f can be etched via procedures for ferritic 
stainless steels others such as fe and si core irons can be etched like low alloy steels with nital 
general tips some etchants such as waterless kalling’s can be made in bulk and stored other reagents such as glyceregia and acetic glyceregia must be prepared each time they are needed both glyceregia 
solutions undergo a continuous chemical reaction as they age becoming very aggressive in less than one hour special care must be taken then because the aggressive solution can affect etching time and 
procedure generally it is a good idea to use the solution as soon as possible after mixing 
as shown in tables 1 and 2 many different etchants can be successful for specific alloys and special circumstances when examining basic microstructure however the choice of reagent does not have to be 
difficult 
with a little experience and a good understanding of what features need to be evaluated the examiner may find that a few etchants will serve the intended purpose the majority of the time in order of 
increasing strength those etchants are nital villelas ralph’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia waterless kalling’s and hydrochloric acid + hydrogen peroxide 
health and safety 
all the referenced etchants are designed to attack the surface of the steels and alloys being analyzed therefore all the etchants contain chemicals that are hazardous to handle store use and discard 
the user of these etchants is responsible for developing appropriate procedures to address all hazardous aspects as required by appropriate health safety and environmental practices and regulations 
individual chemical material safety data sheets msds should be consulted as a starting source for information users are further cautioned that mixtures of the individual chemicals may result in different 
and possibly more significant risks which they are obliged to assess prior to application standard etchant texts contain additional safety and use information

bmi resin infusion material descriptions raptor resins supplies several varieties of bmi resins bmi1 is a tacky semisolid material at room temperature it can be crushed into a powder but the particles 
are tacky and will sinter together at temperatures above 60ºf the resin can be melted and poured at temperatures above 160ºf it is quite fluid at 200ºf at 275ºf the viscosity is typically 35 centipoise 
the resin is not very reactive until temperatures exceed 275ºf thus bmi1 is a very high flow resin well suited to liquid infusion in an oven or autoclave a minimum cure temperature is 350ºf with a post 
cure or 375ºf with no post cure bmi1 requires a minimum pressure of about 15 psig to cure voidfree 
bmi1 powder is advanced to a higher viscosity than standard bmi1 so that the powder is stable and not tacky at room temperature it has a viscosity at 275ºf of about 2000 cps 
bmi2 is a catalyzed version of bmi1 with similar handling and viscosity characteristics it becomes significantly reactive at 230ºf at 275ºf the viscosity is typically 35 cps bmi2 is high flow resin but 
because it is more reactive than bmi1 it has significantly less flow capability it can be cured at 325ºf without pressure to make voidfree laminates bulk bmi2 resin should not be heated above 250ºf 
without continuous temperature monitoring due to the possibility of uncontrolled exotherm bulk resin is much more prone to exotherm than laminates that contain 60% inert fiber the hazards from an 
exotherm are low however because bmi2 will not begin to decompose until its temperature exceeds 800ºf but exotherm temperatures can exceed that 
gore tex membrane is a very stretchy white teflon film that is only a few thousandths of an inch thick similar to teflon pipe thread tape it is laminated to a polyester fabric with a fine weave to

weigh the preform to determine how much resin to add to the preform divide the preform weight by 1resin content then multiply by resin content for example 38% = 038 
for a 12 x 12 panel add 30 grams of resin to account for losses in two layers of carbon paper flow media and edge bleed if peelply is used add the same amount of resin as the weight of peelply 
agging procedure 
a crosssection of the bagging scheme that is used for the powder infusion process is shown below bagging scheme for powder infusion process 1 	
place preform layup onto releasefilm covered tooling plate nonporous teflon impregnated fiberglass is a preferred release film carbon fiber in contact with aluminum tools should be avoided due to a 
galvanic reaction that generates hydrogen gas an fep or other film can alternatively be used to separate the laminate from an aluminum plate one may want to use a peel ply on bottom surface depending 
on the desired surface finish and if it will be used for bonding 2 	
place vacuumbag sealant tape around the preform leaving a gap of 1 2 to 1 between the tape and preform if a square edge is desired on the panel silicone rubber strips may be placed against the edge 
of the panel sealant tapes can offgas during cure and should not contact the panel 3 	
place peelply on top of the preform followed by the perforated armalon sheet this sheet acts as a flexible pressure plate to improve panel thickness uniformity excess resin stays above the sheet and 
is easy to remove 4 	
place two sheets of carbon paper over the perforated sheet the carbon paper is very thin but highly permeable so it allows resin to flow to all the perforations and prevents the perforations from 
being sealedof by the gore tex membrane above the resin the carbon paper is one inch smaller than the perforated sheet so that resin does not flow over the edge of the sheet and sealoff paths to 
remove the residual lowpressure air in the preform no vacuum is perfect 5 	
distribute the preweighed bmi powder on the carbon paper fairly evenly then sweep the powder in the center of the panel towards the edges the powdered resin melts first on the bag side away from 
the preform making the powder layer thinner in the center causes resin to flow though the perforations toward the center of the preform first the resinflow though the preform will be from the center 
toward the edges which helps to sweep residual air toward the edges 6 	
remove the backing paper from the sealant tape and place the gore tex membrane over the resin seal the membrane to the sealant tape so resin cannot leak through wrinkles the gore tex membrane is 
laminated to a woven fabric the side with the woven texture should not be in contact with the resin 7 	
place sealant tape around the periphery of the tooling plate for the final vacuumbag 8 	
place breather material over the gore tex membrane within the bounds of the sealant tape 9 	
seal the vacuum bag in place with appropriate vacuum connections check for vacuum leaks this cure process is somewhat sensitive to the quality of the vacuum better vacuum means less residual air 
in the preform that can become trapped by joining flowfronts

vent vacuum resin packaging raptor resins supplies bmi resins as solid material in metal cans generally a one quart can will contain 2 lbs a gallon can will contain 8 lbs and a 5gallon can will contain 40 lbs making 
crushed resin 
solid resin may be removed from the can by crushing the resin this is best done with a section of metal pipe or round bar about one inch in diameter hammers or objects with corners and sharp edges can tear holes in 
the can the can of resin should be below 60ºf but can be at 0ºf or below simply strike the side of the sealed can hard enough to dent the can start near the top of the resin because the crushed resin needs space into 
which to move work around the can and downward until the desired amount or resin is crushed 
the resin can then be transferred to a plastic bag this method can remove almost all of the contents of the can with very little residue with suitable technique the transfer can be done with very little exposure of 
the cold resin to humid air once in the bag larger chunks of resin can be crushed further if needed this is best done with a flat plate so that the bag is properly supported and is less likely to be punctured the 
crushed resin should be kept below 60ºf until used condensation of moisture on the resin can be avoided by not opening the plastic bag until there are no signs of continuing condensation on the outside of the bag it 
may be helpful to wipeoff any previous condensation of course condensation is highly dependent on ambient humidity melting resin in the can 
all resins are very poor conductors of heat but there are ways to melt them quickly belong 
one method is the heated follower plate pump this consists of a heated plate that is lowered into the top of the can which melts a thin layer of resin on contact the melted resin is drawn to the suction of a pump in 
the center of the plate this suction actually forces the plate to follow the level of melting resin in the can the hotplate usually has a seal or wiper to wipe the walls of the can free of any resin residue on cans 
smaller than 5gallons the lip of the can will need to be cutoff using a canopener this method of melting resin exposes the resin to the minimum amount of heat for the minimum amount of time resin in the can that is 
not used has not been exposed to any heat at all the disadvantage is that the equipment is expensive requires maintenance and cleaning and it may require more resin to prime the pump than is used in making the part 
ovens can be used to melt resins in cans only air circulating convection ovens with good air flow should be used for resin melting the goal is to pump heat as quickly as possible into the resin without over heating 
it this is very different from keeping contents at a uniformly controlled temperature which is what some ovens are designed for transferring quantities of heat requires high air flow or velocity so an oven with a 
strong blower is preferred higher air temp will increase melting rate but this is limited by the maximum resin temperature allowed 
melting resin in a can is very different than heating a block of metal metals are good conductors of heat so there will usually not be a great temperature difference between the surface and the center resins in 
comparison are poor conductors of heat and therefore warm very slowly when conduction is the main mechanism for heat transfer natural convection currents flowing inside the can are the main mechanism for heat 
transfer when melting bmi1 or bmi2 
for natural convection to occur the resin viscosity must not be too high natural convection starts at about 150ºf for bmi1 and bmi2 when a can of resin is placed in a 200ºf oven the outside layer of resin will 
quickly heatup and melt hot resin is lower in density than cold resin so the cold solid resin in the can sinks in the melted resin layer this process continues until the resin is completely melted but during most of 
this process there will be 200ºf resin at the top of the can and a cold solid shrinking lump of resin at the bottom of the can this shows how important it is to have very good air flow against the bottom surface of 
the can because this is where most of the heat transfer needs to occur the can should not be placed on the bottom of the oven or on a solid shelf cans in ovens should be kept sealed or at least covered because 
heating is not desired on the top surface just the prevention of heatloss also bmi resins react slowly with oxygen in the air 
a hotplate could also be used but for several reason this does not generally work well there is usually a gap between the plate and the can due to the bottom rim of the can which leads to poor heat transfer the sides 
of the can do not warm until long after the resin on the bottom is melted so the solid resin cannot sink to come into contact with the can bottom there are heat losses out the sides and top of the can 
pouring molten resin from a can may get very messy if the proper technique is not used aluminum foil can be used to make a disposable pouring spout on the lip of the can the foil should be wrapped over and under the 
inside lip of the can so it is held securely in place it should also extend partway down the outside of the can this prevents resin drips from running down the side of the can and keeps the lip of the can clean so 
that it can be easily resealed this technique also allows resin to be accurately and cleanly dispensed onto a balance to make preweighed resin plaques for preform impregnation remove the foil before the resin freezes 
or you will need to warm the can again to remove the foil 
often a thick coating of resin will remain in the can because it freezes before it can be drained out this can be broken loose and added to another can or the can may be drained completely in an oven cutting off the 
lip of the can with a can opener will allow more complete draining chapter 6 dynamic mechanical analysis 
61 introduction 
the transport behavior of two series of penetrants namely esters and alkanes in a polymeric adhesive has been investigated by means of mass uptake and infrared experiments basic structureproperty relationships 
between the molecular structure and chemical nature of a penetrant were derived it is seen from figure 11 that the structure of a penetrant strongly influences its transport and mechanical properties then it is 
necessary to relate both the chemical structure and transport properties of these penetrants to their effects on mechanical properties of a polymer 
chemical structure in this chapter the effects of transport on the dynamic mechanical relaxation of the r flex 410 polymeric adhesive are discussed the presence of a low molecular weight has been known to drastically 
affect the mechanical relaxation of a polymeric system accelerated testing procedures based upon principles of timetemperature superpositioning proposed by williams landel and ferry1 were devised to create 
doublyreduced master curves of the observed mechanical response the diffusion phenomenon was introduced via the creation of a diffusiontime shift factor this enabled the prediction of the dynamic mechanical response 
of the polymer as a function of temperature and exposure time to a penetrant based upon fundamental properties of both the penetrant molecule additional information regarding the molecular relaxation distribution and 
the effects of penetrant has also been discussed 
62 background 
dynamic mechanical analysis 
dynamic mechanical properties refer to the response of a material as it is subjected to a periodic force these properties may be expressed in terms of a dynamic modulus a dynamic loss modulus and a mechanical damping 
term typical values of dynamic moduli for polymers range from 1061012 dyne cm2 depending upon the type of polymer temperature and frequency 
for an applied stress varying sinusoidally with time a viscoelastic material will also respond with a sinusoidal strain for low amplitudes of stress the sinusoidal variation in time is usually described as a rate 
specified by the frequency f = hz = rad sec the strain of a viscoelastic body is out of phase with the stress applied by the phase angle d this phase lag is due to the excess time necessary for molecular motions 
and relaxations to occur dynamic stress s and strain e given as 
 1 
s = s o sin t + d 2 
e = eo sin t where is the angular frequency using this notation stress can be divided into an inphase component so cosd and an outofphase component so sind and rewritten as 3 
s = so sin t cos d + so cos t sin d dividing stress by strain to yield a modulus and using the symbols e´ and e´´ for the inphase real and outofphase imaginary moduli yields 4 
s = eoe'sin t + eoe cos t 
s o 	s o

e ' = cosd e = sindeo eo 6 
e = eo exp it s =soexp t +d i 
ss s
 oid o
 7 e == e = cosd+ i sind = e ' +ie 
eeo eo 
equation 7 shows that the complex modulus obtained from a dynamic mechanical test consists of real and imaginary parts the real storage part describes the ability of the material to store potential 
energy and release it upon deformation the imaginary loss portion is associated with energy dissipation in the form of heat upon deformation the above equation is rewritten for shear modulus as 
 8 g = g ' +ig 
where g ' is the storage modulus and g ' ' is the loss modulus the phase angle d is given by 
g 
 9 t and = 
g ' 
the storage modulus is often times associated with stiffness of a material and is related to the young’s modulus e the dynamic loss modulus is often associated with internal friction and is sensitive 
to different kinds of molecular motions relaxation processes transitions morphology and other structural heterogeneities thus the dynamic properties provide information at the molecular level to 
understanding the polymer mechanical behavior timetemperature superposition 
due to the viscoelastic nature of polymeric materials the analysis of their longterm behavior is essential this has been the topic of many studies dealing with polymers234 for a viscoelastic polymer the 
modulus is known to be a function of time at a constant temperature the modulus is also a function of temperature at a constant time according to this timetemperature correspondence long term behavior 
of a polymer may be measured by two different means first experiments for extended periods of time can be carried out at a given temperature and the response measured directly this technique becomes 
increasingly time consuming due to the long response times of many polymers the second method takes advantage of the principles of timetemperature correspondence wherein experiments are performed over a 
short time frame at a given temperature and then repeated over the same time frame at another temperature the two methods are equivalent according to the principles of timetemperature superpositioning 
these principles for studying longterm behavior of polymers have been well established by williams landel and ferry1 and have been eloquently explained and demonstrated by aklonis and macknight5 the 
methods of timetemperature superpositioning ie reduced variables are used to accelerate the mechanism of a relaxation or molecular event by either increasing the temperature or increasing the stress 
in the experiment a classic example of such a procedure is given below3 where the stress relaxation modulus from a tensile test is plotted as a function of time over an accessible time scale for various 
temperatures a reference temperature of to=25°c was selected and the modulusversustime curves for the remaining isotherms were horizontally shifted towards this reference until an exact superposition 
is accomplished 
shifting of each isothermal curve results in a much larger smooth continuous curve known as a master curve it can be seen that this procedure results in a dramatic increase in the range of the time 
scale the inset below is known as the shift factor plot the shift factor at represents the magnitude of shifting along the xaxis necessary for a specific isotherm to superimpose on its neighbor in the 
final master curve with respect to a given reference temperature the log at versus temperature plot should be a smooth monotonic curve provided the mechanism of relaxation remains the same during the 
process an inflection in the shift factor plot would be indicative of a change in the mechanism of the process thus invalidating the procedure the actual graphical procedure can be mathematically 
described for a shifted isotherm t1 as 
 10 e to t = e t1 
t 
a
t 
this implies that the effect of changing temperature is the same as multiplying the time scale by a factor at ie an additive factor to the log timescale 
the criteria for the application of timetemperature superpositioning have been described in detail in ferry’s text4 the first criterion is that all adjacent curves should overlap over a reasonable 
number of data points the second criterion is that the same values of the shift factor must translate all of the viscoelastic functions finally the shift factor must follow one of the wellestablished 
relationships the shift factor is usually described either by the wlf equation or the arrhenius relationship the wlf equation named after its founders williams landel and ferry1 is described as 
 c t t 
 11 	log a = 1 g tc2 + t tg 
and is associated with the transition plateau and terminal regions of the time scale the constants c1 and c2 are material dependent parameters that have been associated with fractional free volume 
nd the empirical doolittle expression and are defined as b 2303 fg and fg af respectively the values of c1=174 and c2=516°k were originally thought to be universal and are still widely used5 the 
glassy region of a polymer is accurately described by the second form of the shift factor namely the arrhenius form eq 12 where 
e = activation energy kj mole 
r = gas constant 
t = temperature °k 
tref = reference temperature °k 
e 11 
 12 log at = 2303 t
r tref 
povolo and fontelos6 proposed a very rigorous approach to determine whether or not ttsp is applicable to a set of experimental data by analyzing their relation to each by a scaling method it was 
shown through examples how superpositioning of curves seemed apparent when in reality the experimental curves did not lead to a scalar relationship 
methods of accelerated testing may be applied to any variable that accelerates the process without changing the mechanism of the process being measured some common variables are temperature frequency 
rate humidity filler content ph and chemical polarity 
the use of multiple shifting variables such as temperature and composition may also be used to create a doublyreduced master curve as in the previous descriptions it is necessary that the variables do 
not alter the mechanism of the process monitored it is also imperative that the variables of interest are additive only and are independent of each other 
multivariable shifting has been utilized in the evaluation of stressstrain data for a butadiene elastomer by changing temperature and filler content7 values of initial young’s moduli and of the ultimate 
propertiesstress at break strain at break and the strain energy densitywere evaluated at different temperatures and strain rates and were all superimposed using the wlf equation with c1=886 and c2=1016 
and a reference temperature of –25°c a double reduction in variables was done using an analogous form of the wlf equation for filler volume fraction to create a single master curve this allowed the 
prediction of stressstrain behavior as a function of both temperature and filler content differences in the apparent activation energy terms obtained from shifting the initial modulus and from 
shifting the ultimate properties were assumed to be a measure of the interfacial strength between the polymer and filler surface this composite strength increased greatly as the filler content increased 
values of the initial moduli proved to be dependent only upon filler content since changes in filler particle size showed no effect however this generalization did not apply to the ultimate properties 
in which case dewetting occurred the extent of dewetting was greater for larger filler particles than for smaller ones 
a similar study was also performed by sumita et al8 on nylon 6 with varying contents of ultrafine fillers the yield stress was evaluated at different rates as a function of temperature and filler content 
temperature shift factors for both the neat and filled systems exhibited an arrhenius behavior with a transition coinciding with a crystal transition of nylon 6 doublyreduced master curves of yield 
stress were created for filler compositions ranging from 0% to 20% indicating that the effects of strain rate and filler content were interconvertable with regard to yield stress resulting values of 
yield stress were interpreted in terms of the dispersion strength theory to describe the effects of filler size and content 
another type of compositional shift factor was utilized in a study of semicrystalline poly vinyl alcohol and nylon 69 stress relaxation tests were performed in tension on both materials with different 
degrees of crystallinity over a range of temperature 22°c to 77°c and humidity log e t versus time curves could be shifted along the time axis using temperature and relative humidity as variables 
superposition of the variables was valid except for in the extremes of very high and low humidities and temperatures this study concluded that the application of timemoisture superposition was valid 
when temperature conditions were near those of the polymer transition region 
temperature and moisture were also used as shift variables in the analysis of low molecular weight poly vinyl acetate by emri and ravsek10 samples were tested in torsion at temperatures from 20°c to 
36°c and moisture contents of 0% to 3% water doubly reduced master curves demonstrated the application of timemoisture superposition of pvac for the conditions given 
kohan11 has also shown the temperaturehumidity equivalence for the yield stress of various nylons nylon6 66 610 temperatures were varied from –40°c to 100°c and humidity levels tested ranged from 0% 
to 100% each of the polymers showed similar trends in behavior with regard to temperature and humidity however the extent to which the relative humidity affected the yield stress varied from polymer 
to polymer for instance the properties of dry nylon610 were similar to those of nylon66 at 50% relative humidity unfortunately no interpretation of the different humidity dependencies was made in 
terms of the individual polymer structures 
a very indepth look at the application of reducedvariables to the composition of plasticizers within a polymer was undertaken by schausberger and ahrer12 the materials utilized in this study were 
two grades of polystyrene mw=385 kg mole mw=2540 kg mole two commercially available plasticizers dioctyl sebacate and dioctyl phthalate and one oligomericlike 12diphenylethane were incorporated 
into the polystyrene samples in compositions ranging from 0% to 25% weight frequencytemperature master curves of the dynamic shear storage and loss moduli were constructed for the two neat polymers 
with reference temperatures of 160°c and 180°c respectively additional frequencytemperature master curves were created for the polymers containing various compositions of plasticizer the magnitude 
of relaxation strength was shown to depend upon the square of the weight fraction of the plasticizer the wlf constant c1 exhibited a decrease with increasing plasticizer content while c2 increased 
with increasing plasticizer content the dynamic moduli curves of varying plasticizer concentrations could be superimposed on each other all curves were shifted along the log frequency axis to a 
reference curve of zero concentration and the number of log frequency units translated was designated as a concentration shift factor these concentration shift factors were observed to roughly follow 
a power law relationship with the weight fraction of plasticizer a more accurate description of the relationship between plasticizer concentration and the concentration shift factor was given by a 
generalized free volume model of fujita and kishimoto13 in which polymerdiluent interactions were ignored this model was extended to describe the effect of the plasticizer on decreasing the number 
average molecular weight of the system the use of shear geometry was very important in this analysis since any heterogeneity within the polymerdiluent system would be in a sense averaged out during 
the experiment furthermore the actual shear testing arrangement minimized the surface area through which a diluent could evaporate out of the sample using this procedure the loss of any diluent due 
to evaporation was observed to be negligible 
recent work by shepherd and wightman14 on a silicone adhesive sealant investigates the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the sealant peel fracture energy from a number of different 
substrates doubly reduced master curves were constructed allowing the prediction of crack growth rates as a function of fracture energy temperature and relative humidity of the silicone sealants 
the above discussion demonstrates the utility of multiple shifting variables based upon the principles of timetemperature superpositioning in a variety of applications the current study attempts to 
extend the concept of a compositional shift factor to incorporate the kinetic process of diffusion the concept of a diffusion time shift factor will be introduced to correlate the observed mechanical 
properties with the diffusion process this in conjunction with the temperature shift factor allows for prediction of the mechanical properties of the adhesive as a function of temperature and 
iffusion time simultaneously 
63 concept of distribution of relaxation times 
the concept of relaxation time as it applies to polymeric materials has been described in many texts5151640 typical response of a polymeric material can not be described accurately with a single 
relaxation time unlike that of a liquid material this inability to be described by a single relaxation time is a result of its viscoelastic nature and is one of the characteristics that give polymers 
their unique properties in order to demonstrate the concept of multiple relaxation times for polymers it is necessary to describe the development of this concept from the fundamental theories from 
which it originated mccrum et al40 and t park17 have both given a very thorough description of this development based upon their reviews two basic categories of models describing single and multiple 
relaxation times will be discussed below 
the most simple relaxation model is that described by debye via molecular modeling18 the time decaying function in the debye model is described by the following exponential 
 t 
 13 	f t = exp t 
where f t is the decay function and t is the single relaxation time based upon this model equations such as the one shown below may be derived to permit fitting of experimental data to evaluate the 
relaxation time t 
e e 1
 14 	8 = 
e s e8 1+ it 
where e is the complex dielectric constant 
es = the relaxed dielectric constant and 
e8 = the unrelaxed dielectric constant 
in simple terms es and e8 can be described as the dielectric constants at very low and very high frequencies respectively their difference is directly ese8 is directly related to the relaxation 
strength the previous expressions of the debye model like many of the following empirical models were originally formulated for dielectric properties however in the current study the primary 
concern is the study of dynamic mechanical relaxations in a shearing mode of testing fortunately the development of relationships for dynamic mechanical relaxation parallels that of dielectric 
relaxation 40 so the mechanical analogue of equation 14 described above is given by 
g g 1
 15 	8 = 
gs g8 1+ it 
all ensuing relationships describing the development of relaxation models will be described in terms of shear moduli g 
this model is far from being able to accurately describe the broad relaxation range of polymers however as will be seen it forms the basis for other more accurate empirical models for describing the 
relaxation distribution 
advances in more accurately describing the relaxation distribution of polymers were made in the work of cole and cole19 these researchers described the response of a polymer to a stress in terms of 
multiple relaxation times the time decaying function for a multiple relaxation model was assumed to be a linear summation of the time decaying function for a single relaxation model equation 16 
t 
f t t 16 t a exp i

i where a ti is the fraction of a single relaxation time mechanism with relaxation time ti based upon the colecole model it has been shown1719 that the expression describing dynamic mechanical data may 
be written as

g g 1+ it a 
s 8 o 
where to is considered as a central relaxation time about which all other relaxation times are distributed and a is a fitting parameter with limits of 0=a= 1 this equation reduces to the debye 
expression for a=0 as can be seen by comparison with equation 15 as the deviation from a single relaxation time model becomes greater a 1 the dispersion becomes broader than that for a single 
relaxation time but remains symmetrical about to=1 cole and cole19 proposed a method of graphically representing the effects of multiple relaxation times which now bears their name a colecole 
plot consists of constructing an argand diagram or complex plane plot in which g ' ' is plotted against g ' ’ the expression derived by them can be expressed as

this model represents a depressed semicircle whose center is below the abscissa as shown in figure 61 increasing deviation from a single relaxation time is represented by a depression of the 
semicircle values for to and a can be found experimentally using the following expressions

the colecole empirical equations describe dispersion and absorption curves as being symmetrical about the position to=1 however the behavior of real polymers is characterized by loss curves with a 
high frequency broadening modification of the colecole model was proposed by davidson and cole20 in order to encompass the skew in the colecole arcs incorporation of this concept resulted in the 
following empirical equations

the colecole and coledavidson models are empirical relationships that have been designed to fit experimental data by describing the symmetric and asymmetric relaxation time distributions 
both of them may be described as single parameter models havriliak and negami21 devised a two parameter empirical model that combined the concepts of both the colecole and coledavidson models

the hn expressions are the most versatile empirical relationships due to the existence of two fitting parameters therefore they have often been used to empirically fit dielectric 
data 172223 as well as dynamic mechanical data24 the dynamic mechanical loss moduli determined experimentally in the current study will be fit in the frequency domain using the hn 
formalism a program that has been written by park17 will be utilized for this purpose and is listed in appendix f of this text 
a time decaying function is mathematically very difficult to derive based upon the havriliaknegami expressions however a methodology proposed by boese and kremer22 involves the use of a 
fourier transform of the general expression for dynamic relaxation response as shown below252627

using equations 32 and 33 the time decaying function can be numerically evaluated from the modulus versus frequency data the functional form of the hn description has been 
used to evaluate the g ' ' term in equation 33 typical decay time functions evaluated in this manner are shown for the dielectric response of poly hydroxybutyrate 17 phb at different 
temperatures figure 63 in the current study time decaying functions for loss moduli versus frequency data have been evaluated using a program that is given in appendix g17 which is 
based upon the hn formalism 
the time decay function created using the hn parameters may be compared with the wellknown kohlrauschwilliamswatts kww function the kww function28 is an empirical function that can 
describe the nonexponential time decaying behavior of many relaxation processes it is described by the following expression 
 ß
 t 34 f t = exp1 t
 o 
 
where to is the time at which f t decays to 1 e and the exponent ß describes the breadth of the distribution in the limits of 0 =ß=1 it has been shown29 that as ß increases from 0 to 1 the 
distribution of relaxation times changes from a broad symmetric distribution to a sharp asymmetric one the kww decay function has become widely used to model many relaxation processes in 
polymers 303132 the ß term has been associated with a coupling parameter n=1ß describing the degree of intermolecular cooperativity associated with a relaxation process303133 
in the current study kww expression equation 34 has been fit to the time decay function created using the hn parameters to evaluate to and ß for the dynamic 
mechanical response observed experimentally fitting of equation 34 has been done using a nonlinear program detailed in appendix h17 
the concept of a mean relaxation time is a useful parameter that can describe and compare the average relaxation behavior of different materials it has been shown1734 that an expression for 
the mean relaxation time can be deduced from the kww expression as

equation 37 is the expression that will be used for evaluating mean relaxation times <t> for each of the polymer dynamic mechanical experiments in the current study the mean relaxation 
times will be evaluated as a function of exposure time to different solvents together all of the parameters described above will be utilized to investigate the effects of solvent and exposure 
time on the relaxation behavior of the r flex 410 adhesive system particular attention will be paid to the ß parameter of the kww function to describe the changing cooperative nature of the 
relaxation process 
64 temperaturefrequency master curves as described earlier in this study the mechanical properties of the rogers r flex 410 adhesive have been tested dynamically using a sandwich shearing 
geometry this particular testing mode and geometry were chosen due to the low tg and poor structural rigidity of the material dynamic mechanical data at temperatures in increments of 3 °c 
ranging from –65 ° to 280 °c has been obtained a total of eight frequencies 01 03 13 1030 50 and 100 hz were swept at each temperature 
samples were exposed to the penetrants for various times ranging from 1 to 105 minutes at room temperature then they were weighed their thicknesses were measured and they were placed between 
the shear plates the plates were clamped intimately to the surface of the samples so as to insure contact and to minimize penetrant evaporation an excess of penetrant was also placed inside 
the testing chamber to lower the penetrant activity within the sample samples were quickly cooled down to 65°c and then heated to the final temperature of 280 °c the transition of interest for 
the neat polymer was = 32°c and the boiling points of most penetrants were = 100 °c thus the majority of penetrant remained within the sample as confirmed by measuring the penetrant mass at t

figure 64 dynamic loss moduli as a function of frequency for polymer sample exposed to decane penetrant for 105 minutes 
each experiment consisted of a data set of approximately 60 isothermal curves the concept of timetemperature superpositioning ttsp was used to create a frequencytemperature master curve for the sample 
each isotherm was shifted left or right along the log frequency axis relative to a reference isotherm in order to achieve maximum overlap of the data the reference isotherm was chosen as tref =50°c 
which is approximately the peak position of the middlemost frequency 3hz for the neat material shifting was done so as to ensure that each curve matched the slope of its immediate neighbor closest to 
the reference curve the number of log frequency units through which an isotherm was translated is termed as its temperatureshift factor and is designated as log at by convention shifts towards the 
right are designated as negative while those towards the left are positive shifts 
horizontal shifting essentially compensated for a change in the time scale of a process induced by changes in temperature it is known from the thermomechanical spectrum of polymers that a change in 
modulus coexists with a change in temperature and that thermal expansion decreases the amount of material per unit volume since modulus is defined per unit area deviations from purely horizontal 
shifting may be due to both of the above factors these deviations are manifested in the form of a vertical shift that involves translation of the isothermal curves along the modulusaxis it is often 
rectified by normalizing moduli by the changing density and temperature as535 
 38 e t1t t1 t1 = e t2t at t2 t2 
in the current study vertical shifting was used only when absolutely necessary and their magnitudes were very small as can be seen from a few examples in appendix 
k an example of the final master curve for a sample exposed to the penetrant decane for 105 minutes is shown in figure 65 the corresponding shift factor plot is given in figure 66 and shows a smooth 
transition with no discontinuities it follows the general shape expected from the theories of williams landel and ferry1 the low temperature tail of this plot exhibits an inflection due to the failure 
of ttsp at lower temperatures t = tg and not from any effects due to penetrant melting as shown in dsc scans also given in appendix k

figure 66 temperatureshift factor plot for polymeric adhesive exposed to decane for 105 minutes c1 and c2 values are 803 and 760 respectively 
188 in figure 65 the breadth of the loss modulus master curve indicates the broad spectrum of relaxation times due to the crosslinked nature of the polymer36 using frequencytemperature 
superpositioning the range of frequencies has now been expanded by a factor of at least 3 decades this enables a prediction of the material response at various frequencies usually unobtainable experimentally 
the data presented in figure 65 and figure 66 are representative of only one penetrant at one exposure time however the polymeric adhesive was exposed to each of the nine nalkane penetrants and 
each of the nine ester penetrants for up to six decades of time 100105 min the master curves were constructed using frequencytemperature superpositioning for each of these penetrants and each 
of the exposure times it is not possible to show all these master curves in this text for purposes of brevity however a few typical master curves and their corresponding shift factor plots are 
shown in the following pages figure 67 through figure 620 
the general form for the wlf equation has been described earlier as 
 c1 t tg 
 39 log at = 
c2 + t tg 
comparison to the empirical doolittle equation and an assumption of a linear expansion of free volume above tg provides physical significance to the constants c1 and c2 c1 can be given by 
b 2303 fg and c2 by fg af where b is the doolittle constant and fg is the fractional free volume at tg thus c1 and c2 values can describe the state of a material in relation to its free 
volume so changes in free volume are reflective of changes at the molecular level c1 and c2 constants may be found experimentally using a linearized form of the wlf equation based upon this 
linearized form a plot of 1 
log at versus 1 ttref yields a yintercept equal to 1 c1 and a slope proportional to c2 c1 example plots of this analysis are given in appendix k and tables of all c1 and c2 values for each of 
the penetrants and exposure times are given in table 61 through table 618 the quality of the fits were excellent with statistical r2 values greater than 098 there is no clear trend in the values 
of c1 and c2 determined for each penetrant and exposure time this result may be due to the range of data selected for the wlf constant evaluation regression of the data was limited to the range 
between tref and tref+100°c due to the validity of the wlf equation in this temperature regime and the fact that gross deviations from wlf behavior were observed in the shift factor plots at 
temperatures far below tg 
one question that needs to be addressed results from the complex nature of the diffusion process itself during transport of a penetrant into a polymer film a timedependent gradient in 
concentration exists throughout the thickness of the film in this analysis all dynamic mechanical properties are assumed to be average values from the entire thickness of the films ie homogenous 
distribution of penetrant this assumption is valid since the shear geometry of the test yields information resulting more from the entire thickness of the film also additional experiments were 
performed to see whether or not the observed mechanical response is affected by concentration gradients polymer films were exposed to different penetrants and exposure times they were then 
removed from the liquids and promptly sealed in airtight containers for various lengths of time up to one month for penetrant to equilibrate and become homogeneously distributed dynamic mechanical 
tests were then performed and results from the equilibrated and unequilibrated films corresponded extremely well as can be seen from some examples given in appendix k 
each set of experimental data superimposed very well to form a smooth master curve using temperature as the shift variable as mentioned earlier the magnitude of vertical shifting employed was very 
small the horizontal shift factor plots log at vs ttref also formed smooth functions of the wlf form each shift factor plot enables the prediction of the resulting master curve of the material 
response at a different reference temperature log f at 150 100 50 0 50 100 150 200 250

65 diffusiontime master curves 
in the previous sections the concept of frequencytemperature superpositioning was discussed this process has enabled the prediction of the material response over a huge range of frequency at a given 
reference temperature the assumption in constructing these master curves is that the mechanism of relaxation for the polyamide adhesive remains unchanged and that temperature changes only lead to changes 
in the rate of the relaxation thermorheologically simple the next step of this study which will be discussed in this section is the extension of this concept to the transport process in the 
adhesive this is often very difficult due to the changing nature of the polymer with time during such a kinetic process this type of behavior is usually termed thermorheologically complex and has 
been discussed in detail in the text by aklonis5 the possibility of this behavior is well considered and will be discussed in detail with respect to this work later in this discussion 
for ease of discussion the effects of increased exposure time on the dynamic mechanical spectra with respect to only one of the penetrants out of the 18 penetrants studied will be discussed below it 
can be seen from figure 621 that an increase in exposure time to the penetrant decane from 102 to 105 minutes shifts the mechanical spectrum towards higher frequencies since higher frequencies are 
analogous to lower temperatures this effect can be interpreted in terms of depression of the tg to lower temperatures due to plasticization by the penetrant this is typically what is expected on the 
basis of free volume theories373839

figure 621 frequencytemperature master curves for exposure times of 102 and 105 minutes to decane penetrant 
the master curves for the two different exposure times shown in figure 621 exhibit similar shapes and appear as if they may be transposable this introduces the concept of a potential shift factor 
based upon exposure time to a penetrant 
using a method similar to mccrum read and williams40 multiple curves were normalized with respect to their relaxed and unrelaxed moduli the loss peaks were assumed to arise predominantly from the 
motions of the polymer itself this is a valid assumption for the system studied due to the fact that the penetrants used are poor solvents high values with relatively low solubilities this 
assumption enabled the normalization by gmax thereby creating a common scale for comparison of the various experiments this procedure has now become widely accepted and is extensively used by several 
researchers a good example is the study by ishida et al41 on poly vinyl acetate and poly vinyl benzoate where this normalization has been utilized to create the master curves for the arelaxation of 
these materials 
for a given solvent each master curve representing a particular exposure time has been normalized to a common axis using the technique described above these normalized master curves for the penetrant 
decane are shown in figure 622 the normalized master curves of a few other penetrants representative of both the alkanes and the esters are given in figure 624 through figure 629 
then all the curves have been shifted with respect to an exposure diffusion time of 0 minutes to achieve maximum overlap the number of log frequency units by which each master curve was shifted is 
designated as a diffusiontime shift factor log adt the composite mastermaster curve resulting from the translation of all the diffusiontime master curves for decane shifted with respect to a 
reference time of 0 minutes is also shown in figure 622 the diffusiontime shift factors log adt calculated from figure 622 are plotted as a function of log exposure time in figure 623 the composite 
mastermaster curves corresponding to the previous examples are also shown in figure 624 through figure 629 
the diffusiontime shift factors log adt for the nalkane and ester penetrant series normalized with respect to their equilibrium diffusion times te are shown in figure 630 and figure 631 respectively 
it can be seen from these figures that all of the 40 or more diffusiontime shift factors within a penetrant series can be represented by a single curve this implies that the mechanism of polymer 
relaxation for each penetrant series is not altered by the presence of the penetrant

of a diffusiontime shift factor that has been introduced 
the shape of the curves in figure 630 and figure 631 closely resemble a sigmoidal statistical distribution this resemblance observed is especially good considering the difficult nature of the experiments 
the sigmoidal shape could possibly be related to the fact that diffusion processes are often modeled as being a result of statistical jumps via brownian motion42 
it was mentioned earlier that the mechanism of polymer relaxation is not altered by the presence of the penetrant while its rate is accelerated the presence of the penetrant causes the film to swell resulting 
in an increase in the free volume of the polymer matrix the effect of this free volume increase is to accelerate the rate of relaxation of the polymer this is analogous to the acceleration of the polymer 
relaxation by the temperature variable in the wlf theory43 
comparing the diffusiontime shift factor plots of the nalkanes and esters figure 630 and figure 631 respectively some major differences as a result of the ester functionality can be seen the magnitude of the 
ester shift factors approaches a higher value than that of the corresponding alkanes due to the increased solubility and plasticizing efficiency of the esters the slope of the linear portion for esters 
is also greater than that of the alkanes this is once again due to the higher diffusion rates and increased plasticizing efficiency of the ester penetrants the above two results can also be predicted based 
upon the results of the diffusion experiments that were discussed in the previous chapter those results showed that the diffusion coefficients and solubilities of the ester penetrants were larger than those 
of the corresponding nalkanes 
a double reduction in variables such as the one proposed allows for prediction of the dynamic mechanical response of the r flex 410 adhesive system as a function of temperature and exposure time to any 
of the penetrants studied however the utility of this procedure lies in relating the diffusiontime shift factor to the fundamentals of the diffusion process itself diffusion is a process in which the 
concentration of a penetrant in a polymer matrix increases as a function of time by nature of this process exposure time to a penetrant is related to its concentration via the diffusion coefficient 
therefore the diffusiontime shift factors log adt of the alkanes and esters can also be described as a function of concentration weight fraction as shown in figure 632 and figure 633 respectively 
thus if the diffusion coefficient of either type of penetrant at a given temperature is known its concentrationtime profile may be generated for any geometry by solving the appropriate boundary 
conditions for fick’s second law such a concentrationtime profile enables the correlation of the composition of a penetrant at any given exposure time this composition in turn can be used to evaluate 
the diffusiontime shift factor log adt of the penetrant at that exposure time then a knowledge of log adt in conjunction with the frequencytemperature shift factor log at can be used to construct the 
final master curve accounting for the effects of both temperature and diffusion 4

661 evaluation of hn and kww parameters 
in order to gain a deeper insight into the effects of the diffusion of the nalkane and ester penetrants the dynamic mechanical loss spectra were analyzed in greater detail segmental polymer 
relaxations occurring near the glass transition temperature typically involve localized motions of several backbone segments thus the shape of the viscoelastic dispersion is expected to be 
reflective of local molecular structure33 currently only a few studies are known that have attempted to relate characteristics of the relaxation dispersion to chemical structure in all of these 
studies changes in the 
chemical structure were induced by modifying the backbone of the polymer however in the current study the backbone structure of the polymer investigated has been kept unchanged instead the local 
environment of the polymer segments has been modified by the introduction of small molecular weight penetrants changes in the dispersion of the mechanical loss modulus spectra have been analyzed 
in terms of the ß parameter 
from the kww expression equ 34 the effects of penetrant absorption have also been investigated with respect to relaxation times and mean relaxation times of the polymer 
using the procedure described in section 63 the dynamic loss moduli data of each frequencytemperature master curve corresponding to a particular penetrant and exposure time has been fit to the havriliaknegami 
model of equation 26 the hn model parameters have been calculated from those fits 
using the havriliaknegami fitting parameters the timedecaying function f t autocorrelation function for each penetrant has also been evaluated the autocorrelation functions for the polymer at different 
exposure times to heptadecane hpd is shown as an example in figure 634 these functions describe the relaxation process of the polymer as a function of time the slopes of these functions are a measure of the 
relative rates of relaxation with reference to the inflection point it can be seen that the relaxation times become shorter as the penetrant exposure time increases the autocorrelation function f t of 
each polymerpenetrant system has been fit to the wellknown kohlrauschwilliamswatts kww time decay function equ 34 to yield the ß parameter and to presently described as the kww relaxation time quality of 
the fits was excellent with chi2 values ranging from 005 to 0003 in addition the gamma function described earlier equ 37 has been utilized to evaluate a mean relaxation time <t> for each system these 
parameters will be discussed in more detail later 15 10 5 0 5 10 log time sec 
figure 634 autocorrelation decay functions f t for polymerpenetrant system of heptadecane at various exposure times 662 kww beta parameter 
the ßterm in the kww stretchedexponential characterizes the degree of nonexponentiality of the relaxation function the kww ßterm has been physically interpreted by many researchers30314445 as a 
description of the extent of molecular coupling within a polymer mathematically the ßterm is described as 
ß= 1 n 
where n is designated as a coupling parameter this coupling parameter n has been shown4633
 to be proportional to the strength of the constraints or interactions with nonbonded neighboring segments in the polymer in this discussion the kww ßparameter will be used however its relationship to 
the coupling parameter n has been considered 
the experimental ß values from the kww nonlinear fitting analysis for the nalkanes are shown in figure 635 there is a general decrease in the magnitude of ß as exposure time to the alkane penetrants 
increases due to the difficult nature of the experiments the data shows some scatter as a result general linear trendlines have been drawn to aid in the comparison of the different penetrants the order of 
magnitude ~02 of the evaluated beta parameters implies that the dispersion in relaxation distribution is very large these small values of ß result in large values for the coupling parameter n indicating 
that the polymer segmental relaxations require a high degree of cooperativity 
this interpretation is similar to that of a fragile material as described by angell47 similar values of n have been calculated for the highly cooperative systems such as poly vinyl chloride 44 epon 
1004 epoxy resin44 and poly vinyl methyl ether polystyrene blends30 the decrease in ß observed in figure 635 is a result of the greater variations of local molecular environments45 of the polymer 
with time as penetrant molecules become increasingly dispersed within the polymer sample the distribution of penetrant molecules results in a spectrum of different local environments around individual 
polymer segments thus the distribution of relaxation times can increase regardless of whether or not the relaxation mechanism is the same 
as the size of the alkane penetrant decreases the magnitude of ß also decreases the larger decrease in ß for the smaller molecular weight penetrants is attributed to the higher degree of solubility 
of the smaller molecular weight penetrants this in turn results in a higher composition of the penetrant which further disperses itself amongst the different polymer segments creating a broader array 
of relaxing units the larger molecular weight penetrants exhibit very little statistical change from the typical values of ß˜ 027 for the neat polymer adhesive from the above discussion it can be seen 
that although the values of ß exhibit a slight decrease with increasing exposure time and decreasing penetrant size this decrease is not very significant 030 – 014 therefore the possibility that a 
change in relaxation mechanism could occur during the diffusion process is highly unlikely 
in the following paragraph the kww ßparameters obtained from the curve fitting of the ester penetrants will be discussed figure 636 shows a plot of ß as a function of log exposure time for the ester 
series for the larger molecular weight esters the values of ß decrease with increasing exposure time as was observed with the nalkanes however as the ester penetrants become more soluble the values of 
ß increase with exposure time which can be interpreted as a decrease in cooperativity 0123456 log time min

figure 636 kww beta parameter as a function of exposure time to ester penetrants 
the fact that the slopes of the lines become increasingly positive for the most soluble penetrants might be due to the fact that the higher degree of polarity results in a much higher degree of solubility 
the increase in polarity promotes better distribution of the smaller ester penetrants since the polymerpenetrant interactions are greater furthermore due to the higher levels of penetrant concentration 
the differences in solvent concentration between different areas of the polymer matrix are relatively less both of the above effects lead to an increase in uniformity of penetrant distribution as a result 
the distribution of relaxation times becomes narrower as the polymer segments now relax as similar cooperative units due to the greater uniformity in penetrant distribution 
as with the nalkanes the fact that the magnitudes of the ß values do not change significantly for the esters further supports the assumption that the polymer relaxation mechanism is not changing as a result 
of the transport process this assumption will be further supported by the behavior of the relaxation times for each polymerpenetrant system 
it is implicit in the coupling model of molecular relaxation304648 that timetemperature superpositioning is not valid for a system in which the ßparameter varies significantly the root of this implication lies 
in the fact that changes in the relaxation distribution are often associated with changes in the relaxation mechanism however the ßparameter itself has been shown to be highly sensitive to temperature49 proving 
that it is not always constant for a given system even though the relaxation mechanism remains unchanged 
the changes in ß observed in the current study are relatively small as described previously they are believed to result not from any changes in the relaxation mechanism but from changes in the time frames in 
which they occur throughout the polymer matrix furthermore this study is not a strict assessment of either the principles of timetemperature superpositioning ttsp or of the coupling model for relaxation thus 
the use of ttsp as an empirical method in the current study is valid and justified 663 molecular relaxation times in the previous section the kww ßparameter was discussed in detail with particular attention 
to the coupling model of relaxation a second kww parameter designated as the to also results from the nonlinear fitting procedure the kww to was described earlier as the time at which the time decaying function 
tdf decays to 1 e of its original value it is also designated as the apparent relaxation time in the following section this parameter to and the concept of a mean relaxation time <t> will be discussed 
the kww to and the mean relaxation time <t> for the nalkane series are plotted as a function of normalized time log t teq in figure 637 and figure 638 the corresponding plots for the ester series are shown in 
figure 639 and figure 640 the behavior of the kww relaxation time to and that of the mean relaxation time <t> converge towards a single curve for all members of the nalkane series it may be recalled that this 
is very similar in shape and behavior to the diffusiontime shift factors log adt plotted versus normalized time log t te this behavior indicates that each alkane penetrant affects the relaxation times of the polymer in a similar manner

divorce lawyer lawyers ex slept sleeping sleep sprung anymore rocker recline recliner replace repalcement
as for the nalkanes the exponential decay in relaxation times for the ester penetrants is shown in figure 639 and figure 640 as in the nalkane series all the ester penetrants converge towards a single 
function the normalized curves of figure 639 and figure 640 for the esters also follow the behavior of the normalized diffusiontime shift factor log adt plots described earlier in section 64 the relaxation 
times at equilibrium for the nalkanes and esters differ approximately by a factor of 2 this is the same difference that is observed between the diffusiontime shift factors at equilibrium for the esters 
and nalkanes this is expected since the diffusion of the penetrants alters the relaxation time of the polymer segments which is manifested as a variation in the dynamic mechanical response of the 
polymer 
the fact that the relaxation times for both the ester and alkane series each converge towards single functions fortifies the idea that the mechanism of relaxation remains unchanged throughout the transport 
processes the relaxation time analysis discussed above has enabled the evaluation of the parameters to and <t> that possess physical significance these parameters permit direct comparison of the effects 
of various penetrants as a function of exposure time they have also provided a clearer picture of the effects of the transport process on the relaxation of the polymer furthermore the behavior of the 
relaxation times and the discussion of the kww ßterm lend further support to the concept of the double reduction in temperature and diffusion time log adt proposed earlier section 64 3

67 summary in this chapter the concept of frequencytemperature superpositioning has been employed to create master curves of dynamic loss moduli versus frequency data temperature shift factor plots 
depicting the temperature dependence of the relaxation process were constructed from the master curves these temperature shift factors provided a means of predicting the viscoelastic response of the system 
under different conditions of frequency and temperature accelerated testing of this nature is based upon the premise that the mechanism of the relaxation process is unaffected by changes in temperature then 
the shifts associated with each isothermal curve is attributed to an increase or decrease in the rate of the process due to thermal changes 
comparison of the frequencytemperature master curves of various penetrants at corresponding exposure times led to the concept of a doublereduction in variables a newly developed shift factor designated as 
a diffusiontime shift factor log adt has been incorporated to describe the transport phenomenon and the effects of a penetrant on the polymer relaxation process diffusiontime shift factors for both esters 
and alkanes increased as a function of log exposure time the increasing values of log adt reflected the shifts in the relaxation spectra to higher frequencies ie lower temperatures normalization of the 
time axis by the respective equilibrium diffusion times for each penetrant resulted in a single curve for each of the penetrant series this behavior fortified the idea that the mechanism of mechanical 
relaxation remained unchanged during the transport process for both the esters and nalkanes however the rate of relaxation varied depending upon the chemical structure of the penetrants 
this doublereduction in dynamic mechanical data resulted in the consolidation of over 50 individual master curves into two single curves one each for the nalkane and ester series of penetrants these single 
curves for the alkanes and esters differ slightly from each other due to the differences in diffusion rate and plasticizing efficiency between the two series 
empirical models such as the havriliaknegami and the kohlrauschwilliamswatts function have been directly fit to experimental data these models have been used in conjunction with one another to evaluate 
wellknown quantities from modulusfrequency data the concept of cooperativity has been investigated in view of the discussion on transport properties slight changes in the distribution of relaxation times 
have been attributed to the presence or absence of homogeneities in penetrant dispersion throughout the polymer matrix analysis of these distributions in terms of the kww tkww and the mean relaxation time < t > 
has provided a physical description of the effects of penetrant within a polymer matrix on the dynamic relaxation process values obtained for these t’s supported the assumption of an invariant relaxation
mechanism that was used in the doublereduction procedure thus the existence of the diffusing molecule only aided in accelerating this relaxation mechanism 
the temperaturefrequency shift factors in conjunction with the diffusiontime shift factors allowed for a means of predicting dynamic mechanical response as a function of two independent variables temperature 
and exposure time in the next chapter this ability is further expanded by incorporation of the concepts established in the diffusion study of chapter 4

thanks thanks thanks for this i just finished reading the documentation this is fantastic stuff with the ever increasing complexity of microcomputers such as the cortex cores and 
systems manufacturers are providing development hardware and software systems based on c libraries to make using their chips easier such libraries reduce the requirement for chip documentation the 
conventional approach to providing support for development boards in forth has been to manually port the c library sources to forth the sockpuppet system takes a different approach by providing an interface 
solution between forth and c the forth system calls the underlying c libraries in turn this allows the details of the hardware to be abstracted away by the c libraries whilst 
allowing the forth system to provide a powerful uniform and interactive user interface 
the mpe arm cortex forth crosscompiler supports calling functions in c or any language that can provide functions that use the aapcs calling convention this is an arm convention documented in 
ihi0042f_aapcspdf calls with a variable number of parameters varargs are not supported 
the example code in both forth and c is available for the professional versions of the arm cortex cross compiler the example code provides a simple gui for an stm32f429i discovery board using 
sample c code provided by st and others the interface is defined for cortexm cpus only if you need an arm32 interface contact mpe 
this work is directly inspired by robert sexton's sockpuppet interface 
sockpuppet 
his contribution and permission are gratefully acknowledged 
10 31 2016 1227 pm each function that is exported from the c world to the forth world appears as one of a number of types of call these words are called externs you can handcraft these words in 
assembler but the compiler includes code generators for several techniques the call format and return values match the aapcs standard used by arm c compilers 
there are several ways to call externs they have their pros and cons and are discussed in following sections 
svc calls you just need to know the svc numbers svc calls provide the greatest isolation between sections of code written in other languages the functions foreign to forth are accessed by svc 
calls and or jump tables the example solution uses svc calls for most foreign functions regardless of the primary call technique used all techniques rely on a small number of svc calls jump table 
the base address of the table can be set at run time eg by making a specific svc call the calling words fetch the runtime address from the table given an index double indirect call a primary jump 
table is at a fixed address and contains the addresses of secondary tables which hold the actual routine addresses the fixed address and both indices must be known at compile time this technique 
is used by ti's stellaris parts and some nxp parts to accesss driver code in rom direct calls to the address of the routine you need to know the address at compile time 
there is a practical limit of four arguments if you use svc calls for the insulation between forth and c if you want this limit changed call mpe ! the other interface methods do not suffer from 
this limit 
it is a matter of convention between the forth and c code as to parameter passing order it can be changed by either side mpe convention is for the leftmost forth parameter to be passed in r0 this 
matches the aapcs code used by the hosted forth compilers such as vfx forth for arm linux we strongly suggest that you use the mpe convention in order to take advantage of future sockpuppet developments 
svc calls 
the examples use the mpe calling convention and are illustrated in assembler as well as by using the code generator 
svc 67 void bsp_lcd_drawcircle int x int y int r \ svc 67 draw a circle of radius r at position xy 
code bsp_lcd_drawcircle \ x y r \ svc 67 draw a circle of radius r at position xy mov r2 tos \ r ldr r1 [ psp ] # 4 \ y ldr r0 [ psp ] # 4 \ x svc # __sapi_bsp_lcd_drawcircle ldr tos [ psp ] # 4 \ 
restore tos nextendcode 2 of 14 
when the svc call occurs the cortex cpu stacks registers r0r3 r12 lr pc xpsr on the calling r13 stack with r0 at the lowest address the svc handler places the address of this frame in r0 r4 extracts the 
svc call number reloads the aapcs parameters from the frame and jumps to the appropriate c function in this case 
10 31 2016 1227 pm 
void bsp_lcd_drawcircle 
 uint16_t xpos uint16_t ypos uint16_t radius 
svc calls provide the highest insulation between forth and c but suffer from several issues 
the svc call mechanism is part of the cortex interrupt and exception system the assembler and or c side of this uses code written in assembler to allow the c routines called from a jump table to to be 
aapcs compliant the svc mechanism is inefficient compared to a direct aapcs handler because svc calls are part of the cpu interrupt mechanism you have to care how long a call takes playing games with 
cortex interrupt mechanism can fix this but is complex 
jump table 
in order to avoid the penalties of the svc call mechnism you can make an array of function pointers in c or assembler and call functions using an index into the table 
jumptable dd func0 dd func1 address of function 0 address of function 1 we still need to know the address of the jump table this is found using an svc call 15 and stored in a variable the jump table 
address could be hardcoded but given the horrors of perverting link map files and the like the overhead of a single svc call is preferable 
svc 15 void getdirfntable void \ define svc call that returns the address of the \ jump table variable jt \ addr \ holds the address of the jump tablejt holdsjumptable\ tell the cross compiler where the 
jump table address\ is held initjti \ initialise jump table callsgetdirfntable jt ! jti n int open const char pathname int flags mode_t mode if constructed in assembler the svc despatch table and 
the main jump table can be the same table it's just a question of what you put in the table double indirect call tables 
before use you have to declare the base address of the primary rom table used for calling rom functions for luminary ti cpus this will probably be

pin has no effect the pin s are specified using a bitpacked byte where each bit that is set identifies the pin to be 
accessed and where bit 0 of the byte represents gpio port pin 0 bit 1 represents gpio port pin 1 and so on returns 
none to call this function use the forth form port pins val rom_gpiopinwrite direct calls 
where the address of the routine is known at the forth compile time you can use a direct call
 dir addr int foo int a char b char c 
the forth word marshalls the parameters and calls the subroutine at target address addr the demonstration code provided here mostly uses svc calls to call the svc a small forth word puts the arguments 
into registers calls the svc and then returns a value if required svcs are identified by a number which corresponds here to an index into a a table 
the list must match the equivalents in the c code svc_syscall_table [ ] to ease sharing of data between the forth and c systems you can use the enum parser described in the interpreter directives chapter

observations of thermonuclear xray bursts from accreting neutron stars nss in lowmass xray binary systems can be used to constrain ns masses and radii most previous work of this type has set these 
constraints using planck function ts as a proxy both the models and the 
data are t with diluted blackbody functions to yield normalizations and temperatures which are then compared against each other here for the rst time we t atmosphere models of xray bursting nss 
directly to the observed spectra we present a hierarchical bayesian tting 
framework that uses stateoftheart xray bursting ns atmosphere models with realistic opacities and relativistic exact compton scattering kernels as a model for the surface emission we test our 
approach against synthetic data and nd that for data that are welldescribed 
by our model we can obtain robust radius mass distance and composition measurements we then apply our technique to rossi xray timing explorer observations of ve hardstate xray bursts from 4u 
1702429 our joint t to all ve bursts shows that the theoretical atmosphere 
models describe the data well but there are still some unmodeled features in the spectrum corresponding to a relative error of 1–5% of the energy ux after marginalizing over this intrinsic 
scatter we nd that at 68% credibility the circumferential radius of the ns in 4u 
1702429 is r = 124 ±04 km the gravitational mass is m = 19 ±03m8 the distance is 51 < d kpc < 62 and the hydrogen mass fraction is x < 009 
key words dense matter — stars neutron — xrays binaries — xrays bursts 
1 introduction 	can set constraints on the size of the emitting area for early work in this eld see eg ebisuzaki 1987 damen et al 1990 van 
the masses and radii of neutron stars nss encode valuable inparadijs et al 1990 lewin et al 1993 it was however only the 
formation about the properties of the matter in their cores lat
rossi xray timing explorer rxte that was able to produce 
timer 2012 lattimer & steiner 2014 which reaches several a large catalogue of observations to study see eg galloway 
times nuclear saturation density and has strong isospin asymmeet al 2008 since then a large number of bursts from dierent 
try and which therefore cannot be analyzed in terrestrial laborasources have been put to use for recent reviews see miller & 
tories hence detailed measurements of ns masses and radii are lamb 2016 suleimanov et al 2016 there are currently two 
invaluable in the study of cold dense matter and in particular the principal methods that are being used to infer the gravitational 
equation of state eos of the matter ie the relation between mass m and the circumferential radius r from burst cooling tails 
thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure and the energyboth of which stem from the earlier work the touchdown method density see miller 2013 özel 2013 miller & lamb 2016 for eg özel 2006 
özel et al 2009 güver et al 2010 özel et al 
recent discussions the reliability of such constraints depends 2016 and the cooling tail method eg suleimanov et al 2011a 
on the degree to which systematic errors can be controlled in poutanen et al 2014 nättilä et al 2016 suleimanov et al 2017 
many current analyses such errors are signicantly larger than both methods t the observed emission using planck function 
the formal statistical uncertainties see miller 2013 miller & and then compare the evolution of the observed temperature 
lamb 2016 as well as on the precision of the astrophysical and normalization to the predictions of models see however 
models that are applied to the data 
ku´smierek et al 2011 for an early attempt to circumvent the one type of source that has attracted considerable attention usage of planck function ts only these ts simplify model in this 
context is lowmass xray binaries lmxbs that exhibit comparison signicantly 
because the observed spectra are relfrequent thermonuclear xray bursts for reviews see lewin atively well described by thermal emission however because et al 1993 strohmayer & bildsten 2006 
by collecting obserneither model atmosphere spectra eg suleimanov et al 2012 
vations from these bursts and modeling how they cool down we nor the most accurately measured observed spectra miller et al 2011 are exactly planckian using planck ts as proxies throws away 
information and could even introduce biases 
here we present for the rst time simultaneous direct atmosphere model ts to a set of xray burst observations we begin by studying the constraints that can be obtained from synthetic data for 
which our model is a good description this allows us to assess the accuracy of 
our method and to explore possible biases in the results we then apply our method to data from ve hardstate bursts of 4u 1702429 we obtain interesting constraints on the mass and radius of this 
star and also study some of the previously neglected physical assumptions 
present in the tting procedures the lmxb system 4u 1702429 is a particularly good testbed for the tting as there has already been cooling tail modeling of the ve hardstate bursts from this source 
nättilä et al 2016 our initial analysis suggests that direct tting of 
detailed atmosphere models to data is a promising avenue for extracting neutron star masses and radii from xray burst data 
in sect 2 we present the theoretical basis for our analysis this section is split into two parts in sect 21 we describe how to model the emergent radiation and to couple it to the actual 
observations and in sect 22 we formulate the bayesian frame
work and present our hierarchical tting model we apply our model to synthetic data in sect 31 and then to real xray burst observations from 4u 1702429 in sect 32 in sect 32 we also present our new 
improved mass radius distance and composition constraints for the source 
in sect 4 we discuss our results finally we present our summary in sect 5 2 methods 
21 model for the emerging radiation 
suppose that radiation from a point on the surface of a ns is initially emitted with a local specic intensity i ' at energy e ' 
e ' 
as measured in the local frame of the emission assuming that the radiation propagates through vacuum to a distant observer that observer will detect this radiation at energy e where the energies are related by 
e 1 = 1 
e ' 1 + z 
where z takes into account both the rotationinduced doppler shifts and the gravitational redshift in the limit of low spin frequency 0 the external spacetime is schwarzschild and there are no 
doppler shifts and therefore the net redshift approaches 
 1 2
2gm 
lim 1 + z =1 2 
0c2r
where g is the gravitational constant c is the speed of light and m and r are respectively the gravitational mass and the circumferential radius of the ns a distant observer will measure a specic 
monochromatic intensity ie that is related to the original specic intensity i ' liouville’s theorem for photons see eg

e
the total observed monochromatic ux from the star as seen by a distant observer is then see eg nättilä & pihajoki 2017 
 
fobs e =iedo 4 where do is the solid angle that the surface element occupies on the observer’s sky in this paper we consider a uniformly emitting slowly rotating ns in this limit the observed ux is 
related in a simple way to the ux f ' emitted at the ns surface 
f ' e ' r8 f2 f ' e ' r f2 fobs e == 5 
 1 + z 3d 1 + zd 
where r8 = r 1 + z is the apparent ns radius d is the distance 
p 1
to the source and f ' e ' = 2p ie ' ' µ µdµ where µ is the cosine 
0
of the angle between the local normal direction and the direction of emission of radiation 
in general a burster is not expected to emit uniformly and rotation rates of known bursters extend up to 620 hz muno et al 2002 watts 2012 rotation introduces doppler shifts that vary over the 
surface of the star and therefore smear sharp spectral features such as 
line these shifts also broaden continuum spectra but such broadening can usually be neglected nättilä & pihajoki 2017 moreover the assumption of uniform emis
sion combined with slow rotation means that the observed ux depends on the surface ux and distance but not the angular dependence of the specic intensity this is not true in more general situations we 
employ these approximations because they allow us to simplify the 
general equation 4 and avoid the usage of computationally costly ray tracing to combine the ux from dierent parts of the star they also allow us to neglect a few potentially important but often unknown 
parameters such as the ns rotation frequency and the observer’s 
inclination angle as well as the unknown latitude dependence of the ux 
the gravitational acceleration at the ns surface is given by gm 
g = 1 + z 6 r2 
the shape of the emerging spectrum has a weak dependence on 
g the composition of the atmosphere also aects the spectrum via the energy dependence of the opacity which includes contributions from both true absorption and scattering for example for an 
atmosphere with a hydrogen mass fraction x the thomson scattering opacity is 
1 t ˜ 02 1 + x cm2 g 7 
assuming the thomson opacity and a spherically symmetric ux the outward radiative acceleration balances the inward gravitational acceleration at the stellar surface when the stellar luminosity reaches 
the eddington luminosity ledd which is dened by 
4pgmc ledd = 1 + z 8 t 
the actual critical luminosity is reached when the radiative acceleration r 
grad = f 9 c 
equals the surface gravitational acceleration g here r is the ux mean opacity equal in our case to the rosseland mean opacity 
 
f =f ' e ' de ' = ssbt 4 10 e 
is the bolometric surface ux te is the eective temperature of radiation and ssb is the stefanboltzmann constant at high j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
temperatures close to the critical luminosity the opacity is dominated by compton scattering and is smaller than t because of the kleinnishina eect poutanen 2017 resulting in a critical luminosity 
exceeding ledd by 5–10% suleimanov et al 2012 we will use the ratio 
grad g to measure the escaping ux from the star 
using eq 8 we can also introduce the bolometric edding
ton ux 
ledd gc 
fedd == ssbt 4 = 11 
4pr2 edd t 
characterized by the corresponding eddington temperature tedd the corresponding observed eddington ux then can be obtained integrating eq 5 over energies 
fedd = a fedd = a ssbtedd4 8 12 
 1 + z 4 
where a = r8 d 2 is related to the apparent angular size of the star and tedd8 = tedd 1 + z is the redshifted eddington temperature 
for the ux escaping from the ns surface f ' e ' we will use the spectra from the atmosphere models computed in suleimanov et al 2011b 2012 and nättilä et al 2015 these calculations are based on the 
stellar modeling program atlas kurucz 1970 1993 but modied to deal with 
high temperatures ibragimov et al 2003 suleimanov & poutanen 2006 suleimanov & werner 2007 and to take into account compton scattering suleimanov et al 2012 using an exact relativistic redistribution 
function see eg poutanen & svensson 1996 the models are computed 
in hydrostatic equilibrium using local thermodynamic equilibrium and assuming a planeparallel atmosphere structure because of these approximations our model is only valid when the atmospheric scale height 
is much less than the stellar radius which means that grad g 
must be less than and not too close to unity 
here we limit our model spectra to the range grad g = 
02 098 to avoid any physical complications occurring at low or high temperatures at high temperatures the scale height is too large and at low temperatures relevant late in the burst tails it is likely 
that ongoing accretion breaks the assumption that the observed 
radiation emerges only from the passively cooling neutron star surface in practise limiting grad g to such a range implies focusing on the rst ~ 10 seconds of the cooling tail the compositions computed by 
suleimanov et al 2012 were pure hydrogen x = 1 pure helium x = 
0 y = 1 and solar hydrogentohelium ratio x = 0738 with dierent metallicities 001 01 03 and 10 of solar here for simplicity we consider the atmospheres with a metallicity that is 001 of solar such a 
selection is possible and does not introduce a considerable error 
because metals will only aect the spectra at the very late stage of the burst when the atmosphere has a suciently low eective temperature suleimanov et al 2011b 2012 we on the other hand do not consider 
observations on such a late stage where this eect would play a 
role note also that exact selection of the metallicity does not play a key role here because we do not consider cold atmosphere models we use grad g > 02 for which photoionization edges start to dominate 
the spectral features in addition we consider surface gravities 
of log10 g = 140 143 and 146 with g is cgs units 
we use these models to obtain spectra with any given grad g log g and x by linearly interpolating or in the case of log g also linearly extrapolating the logarithm of the monochromatic uxes on the model 
photon energy grid the model parameter limits are grad g = 02098 
log g = 137149 and x = 01 we checked the accuracy of our interpolations by comparing our results against actual model spectra that were computed between the original grid points and found that the 
relative accuracy of the spectral energy ux was better than 1% 
of course what we observe is not energy ux but rather photon counts in energy channels we therefore convert our model spectra to photon counts by convolving them with a response function r i e of a 
detector 
8 cmi = td m e r i e de 13 0 
where m e is the photon number ux of the model at energy e and td is the observing time here the response function r is proportional to the probability that an incoming photon of energy e will be 
detected in channel i and is a discrete function ie a response matrix such that 
p ej 
r i e de 
ej1
rd i j = 14 ej ej1 
for an energy range ej1 to ej in addition one must take into account that the data might have a nonzero background in this case we t the observed background with some spectral model fbkg e so 
that our total model photon ux at energy e is 
fbkg e fobs e 
m e = + 15 ee 
the background ux is often estimated by observations prior to or after the burst but observational yu et al 1999 van paradijs & lewin 1986 kuulkers et al 2003 chen et al 2011 in’t zand et al 2011 
serino et al 2012 degenaar et al 2013 worpel et al 2013

genaar et al 2016 koljonen et al 2016 kajava et al 2017c and theoretical work walker 1992 miller & lamb 1996 bal
lantyne & strohmayer 2004 ballantyne & everett 2005 sug
gests that the burst can increase or decrease the background rate and even change its spectrum thus background estimates from times near the burst are unreliable and use of them could introduce bias 
this is one reason that we focus on bursts that occur during the hard 
spectral state for such bursts the persistent background emission is very weak 1% of the peak ux therefore although in practice we estimate the background using a 16 s observation prior the burst which 
we nd is described well by blackbody plus power law components 
bbodyrad and powerlaw in xspec the background modeling is unimportant because the emission is dominated by the burst radiation results supporting this kind of static persistent emission treatment were also 
presented in kajava et al 2017c where it is concluded that 
ven if the background emission varies during the burst it is unlikely to contribute more than 1% of the burst ux in the hard state in the soft state on the other hand one of the persistent 
emission components can brighten more than 10fold during the 
bursts kajava et al 2017a finally we note that we multiply both the background and the theoretical burst spectra by an interstellar absorption model similar to phabs in xspec to account for 
the nonzero neutral hydrogen column depth 
22 hierarchical tting model for m and r constraints 
next we construct a framework for comparing the emission models to the actual observations of xray bursts in order to do this we formulate a hierarchical model for a ns that has been observed to 
have nb bursts bk where k = 1 nb we denote the set of all bursts as gb 
={bk}kn=b1 each of these bursts bk has ns spectra which we label as s jk one for each time bin j the k ns <= 
set of all spectra in bk is similarly denoted as gs =sjkj=k 1 k 
each spectrum s jk consists of a set gc = nc jk with nc 
jk cdijki=1 jk measurements of counts cdi jk measured in the detector channel i for a single channel we can dene the likelihood function as l m i = p d|m h so that p d|m h is the probability of the 
data d given the model m and a set of assumptions h when the source of 
experimental noise is due to the number of events arriving at the detector the counting statistics are poisson distributed hence to estimate the model’s goodnessoft for one element cdi = cdi jk in some 
arbitrary burst bk and spectrum s jk we compute the likelihood for 
a poisson distributed data as 
cmi
 cmi cdieli = 16 
 cdi ! 
the joint likelihood for a single spectrum is then 
 
ls m = p cdi imax |m h =li 17 
i = imin i 
where i ranges from the rst detector channel imin to the last detector channel imax used in the analysis note that because in practice likelihoods can be extremely large or small we instead use log 
likelihoods in our analysis the joint likelihood for a
o
burst is lb = sls and the total joint likelihood for all bursts
o
is l = blb 
in the limit of high count rate the poisson distribution is well approximated by a gaussian distribution in this case the likelihood is proportional to exp 2 2 where1 
 
 cdi cmi 2 <= 
2 = 18 
icmi 
because 2 is proportional to the log likelihood the joint log likelihood for the spectra in a burst and the joint log likelihood for all bursts is the sum of the individual 2 values we caution that 
particularly in the higherenergy channels it can be that there are not 
enough counts that the poisson distribution is wellapproximated by a gaussian in this case 2 is not a good approximation to the log likelihood and this could contribute to the formally poor 2 we nd 
in section 32 when we analyze data from 4u 1702429 
it is also possible that we have underestimated the uncertainties in our data in this case it is typical in a bayesian analysis to introduce an intrinsic scatter sint into the system physically the 
intrinsic scatter can be understood to originate either from the 
instrument calibration error or from the uncertainty in the actual model used which as we recall is interpolated from tabulated points in the space of composition surface gravity and temperature the 
addition of intrinsic scatter is similar to the error expansions in 
frequentist methods where data errors are increased until the total 2 dof is around unity the underlying idea is that intrinsic scatter acts to quantify and penalize our ignorance 
1 this is known as pearson’s weighting when the statistical error in the denominator is taken from the model similarly one could describe the error with the help of the data counts as is done with 
the neyman’s weighting both of them are biased in the opposite 
directions estimators of the model parameters see humphrey et al 2009 
of the model by increasing sint the possible credible regions for other parameters also inate to take into account that the data are not fully described by the model mathematically this is done by 
convolving the original gaussian distribution ns x where s can be taken 
to be v cm in relation to the 2 formulation with another normal distribution with undened error sint it is standard to assume given no other knowledge that the errors can be added in quadrature s2 = 
s2 + s2 the likelihood in eq 16 
tot int
can then be replaced with 
li = ns nsint cdi cmi 
 
11 cdi cmi 2 = exp <=
 
 19 2 s2 + s2 
2p s2 + s2 int
int where marks the convolution of the two functions taking the logarithm simplies the latter expression to 
1 1 cdi cmi 2 <= 
ln li = const ln s2 + s2 20 
int 22 s2 + s2 <=
int from this we see that the expression reduces to 2 when sint 0 w 
some balance between the two terms and sint can only grow to some nite value where the previously unexplained 
scatter in the observations is then explained by the model 
the actual model spaces are then constructed hierarchically on top of dierent clusters of nested data groups such a model with nested hierarchy can be physically motivated by considering our problem at 
hand we have a neutron star that has some model parameters that can characterize it such as size distance this neutron star will then exhibit bursts that could also have some model parameters such as 
composition ignition depth the bursts however all share the same parameters that the neutron star has and hence in the model parameter hierarchy the burst parameters appear lower the bursts on the other 
hand are constructed of a series of snapshots in time that we call energy spectra again one individual spectrum could have parameters dedicated only to that one particular spectrum or share some parameters 
among the other spectra in the burst such a nesting of parameters we then call a hierarchical nested model in this paper 
in this work we consider four hierarchical models a b c and d presented in table 1 as an example we next go through the models in more detail at the top level of model awe dene 3 shared global parameters ns 
mass m radius r and distance d to the star the combination of m and r then gives us the surface gravity g and the redshift 1 + z these can be combined with the distance to give the quantity a which is 
proportional to the solid angle occupied by a ns on the sky in addition to these basic parameters we can set a global composition of the accreted matter via the hydrogen mass fraction x as is done in 
model b the next level in the model involves the dierent bursts bk gb for which we do not introduce any clusterspecic subparameters in this work going further in the hierarchy tree each spectrum of the 
burst s jk gs bk has always at least one individual k <= 
parameter to sample the eective temperature of the emerging spectrum as expressed through the parameter grad g in model c we also introduce the fraction s f that emits and we assume that j nättilä et al 
atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra table 1 parameters of hierarchical tting models 
model name global parameters burst parameters spectrum parameters assumptions 
gb gs k h <= 
model a m r d — grad g x = 0 s f = 1 model b m r d x — grad g s f = 1 model c m r d — grad g s f x = 0 model d m r d x sint — grad g s f = 1 
the emitting portion emits uniformly s f is a free parameter that enters the ux equation by modifying the apparent angular size a ' = s f a as we will see later on the real data are not fully described 
by the model to accommodate this deviation we in the end expand the model bby introducing a free intrinsic scatter to the system on the global scale we label this model d in contrast to models a to c for 
d we choose a nonuniform phenomenological distance prior this choice is motivated by the synthetic data results intrinsic scatter is always when present sampled as ln s2 as it is a scale parameter in the 
model int <= 
when a parameter is not free but has some xed value our model is said to have a set of physical assumptions h that implicitly enter the likelihood calculations the strictest set of assumptions h is 
imposed for model a which assumes constant uniform emitting area s f = 1 and known nonvarying chemical composition x = 0 or 073 in this work in model b the assumption of the chemical composition is 
relaxed similarly in model c we test the validity of the constant emitting area assumption 
on a purely theoretical basis one would expect a model with every parameter dened as free in the lowest hierarchy level to be the least informative by allowing both the hydrogen fraction x and the surface 
fraction s f to evolve freely in time for each spectrum we could check the assumption of constant uniform emitting area and constancy of the chemical composition in practice such freedom in the model is not 
however possible as x and s f are strongly correlated because they both affect the normalization of the ux while composition does have a slight eect on the shape of the spectral energy distribution the 
current data do not allow any meaningful constraints without the additional normalization dependency these freedoms could be slightly limited by making the composition vary only from burst to burst this 
would then allow us to study the time evolution of the composition on much longer timescales from burst to burst another possibility would be to introduce a burstspecic s f term into the model to allow 
variations between bursts for example by a changing accretion disk inner radius 
finally we sample the parameter model space using bayesian inference we introduce uniform prior distributions for m and r in the range 1022 m8 and 816 km respectively for the distance a uniform prior is 
taken in between d = 2 10 kpc for the model d we choose to sample not vd but d3 2 corre
sponding to a weakly informative prior of d for the distance that slightly favors larger values such a selection seems to remove the otherwise strong preference for smaller masses2 we discuss this 
selection further in sect 31 when the hydrogen 
2 in our case asserting an informative distance prior leads to a at posterior in mass however this will most likely also aect physical observables such as the ux thus even though we appear unbiased 
in mass we are now biased in the ux because of this the aforementioned distance prior is only imposed for this one model to study the possible eects it might have fig 1 synthetic spectra crosses with 
corresponding bestt atmosphere models solid lines for a dierent colors show spectra for varying grad g individual spectra are shifted by factors of 2 in the ydirection for clarity 
mass fraction is not xed we assume a at prior ranging from 0 pure helium to 1 pure hydrogen for the spectrumspecic nuisance parameters we take similarly uniform limits so that grad g = 02 098 and s 
f = 05 15 note that values of s f > 1 are also allowed as it might be possible that the apparent emitting area exceeds the one inferred from the star’s angular size a because of reection from the 
accretion disk lapidus & sunyaev 1985 we also do not impose any time relation in any of our models between neighboring time bins via adjacent grad g values every spectrum is free to attain any value 
in the prior range regardless of the adjacent spectra we then constrain the model parameters by sampling from the posterior distributions using markov chain monte carlo sampling to explore the parameter 
spaces we implement an aneinvariant ensemble sampler as discussed in goodman & weare 2010 see also guillot et al 2013 the actual implementation is heavily based on the bamr code steiner 2014a which on 
turn relies on the o2scl library steiner 2014b the ensemble sampler is similar to a normal metropolishastings algorithm but evolves not one but many parallel sample values called walkers together the random 
step for each walker is then done using a socalled stretch move algorithm where each walker makes a small step in the parameter space in relation to the whole ensemble acceptance is still performed using a 
metropolishastings scheme with correlated distributions this will improve the autocorrelation times of the chains tremendously allowing us to sample the parameter space more thoroughly in a shorter 
time 
fig 2 evolution of the normalized luminosity grad g for burst #1 of the synthetic data constraints on the surface fraction s f are also shown for model c which is the only one of our models in which this 
parameter is free the dotted black line with the scale on the right axis shows the corresponding standard deviation of the obtained parameter distributions the blue dashed line shows the input value used to 
create the data the darkness of the red coloring is proportional to the probability density this gure shows that when the tting model is consistent with the model used to produce the data we obtain parameter 
values that are accurate and precise 
3 analysis 
31 synthetic data 
we begin our analysis by applying the methods described above to synthetic data the mock data is created to resemble the observations from nasa’s rxte proportional counter array pca jahoda et al 2006 we 
produce data using r = 12 km m = 15 m8 d = 60 kpc and x = 0 these values are similar to those inferred from the ve bursts of 4u 1702429 that we analyze later see nättilä et al 2016 we also study similar ns 
con
gurations but with x = 073 which thus corresponds to solar composition to see how the composition aects the results the mock observations are created by computing the actual model spectra using the atmosphere 
models described in sect 21 in this process 20 spectra for each burst are created for 5 bursts in total so that grad g is linearly spaced between values of 02 and 
095 for each spectrum we convolve the model with an actual rxte pca response matrix compute the number of observed counts in each energy channel and then draw the observed number of counts from a poisson 
distribution centered around the real value for the background spectra we use the real background les from 4u 1702429 hard state bursts we increase the exposure time from 025 seconds to 05 seconds after 
10 time bins this procedure is commonly used for real data to keep the signaltonoise level per time bin approximately constant despite the decreasing ux we x the neutral hydrogen column depth to nh = 187 
× 1022 cm2 which again is similar to that of 4u 1702429 worpel et al 2013 fig 1 shows a set of spectra from one such synthetic burst 
next we t this synthetic data with dierent models to assess how well we expect to constrain each model parameter this also gives us information about the possible biases in the method given that we know the 
input values of the parameters from here on when we discuss credible regions we will always be referring to the highest posterior density regions first we study how well we can get information about 
nuisance parameters such as the normalized gravity grad g and the fraction s f of the surface that emits fig 2 shows the evolution of these parameters note also that our other parameters such as m r and 
d are allowed to vary freely when the surface fraction is xed we obtain the correct grad g with a precision of about 002 in units of grad as can be seen from the width of the 68% posterior distributions 
for models a and b if s f is taken to be free model c the uncertainty in grad g increases by an order of magnitude although the input value is within the uncertainty region s f is determined with a 
precision of about 10% the lower precision for s f is because only the spectral shape rather than the amplitude is used to match the model to the data 
as a next step we consider the parameters of greatest interest fig 3 shows the marginalized parameter distributions for m r d and x when sampled along with the 2dimensional posterior space projections 
fig 4 shows the mr projection in more detail we see that model a is able to recover the correct radius r = 12 km with an accuracy of about 07 km after marginalization over all other parameters the mass 
on the other hand is always underestimated and shows a bimodal structure that is familiar from cooling tail ts suleimanov et al 2011a poutanen et al 2014 nättilä et al 2016 suleimanov et al 2017 the 
input m r value is just at the boundary of the 95% credible region we determine the distance with a 68% scatter of about 06 kpc and no bias the sharp spike in the marginalized distance distribution near 
the maximum value originates from the solutions near the critical line where r = 4gm c2 mass and radius values on this line correspond to the solutions that are close to the maximum distance attainable 
for the system see eg appendix a of poutanen et al 2014 for more discussion 
when the hydrogen fraction x is a free parameter and the data are analyzed using model b we see that both the radius and the mass are now underestimated such an eect originates from the asymmetric x 
distribution which arises because the lower limit of x = 0 is set by physical assumptions for larger x we get smaller values of m and r than what we obtain using x = 0 in the m r plane our proper solution is 
now only inside the 95% credible regions of the posteriors due to the strong bias toward smaller masses for similar reasons the distance in this case is underestimated the hydrogen fraction is constrained to 
be x < 02 with 95% credibility 
when x = 073 there is a similar underestimation of the values of the parameters this is again caused by the connection between x d and m in this case the posterior for x is not symmetric around the true value 
because the distance has a maximum set by the observed ux level this causes x to favor larger values ie x > 073 and so the constraints on m and d are similar to the results from the model banalysis when x = 0 
ideally we would like the method to be free from any bias in m r d or x these parameters are not however our observables quantities closer to the observations include the redshift given in eq 2 which depends 
on m and r and the surface gravity g dened by eq 6 which is also a function of m and 
r the distance d and the hydrogen fraction x enter the system of equations via the ux eq 5 which in turn is limited by j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra fig 3 posterior distributions 
for the mcmc run with synthetic data for models a and b the top panels of the triangles show the marginalized parameter posteriors in arbitrary units here the dark and light orange shadings give the 68% and 
95% credible regions the lower panels show the projected twodimensional parameter posteriors against each other for these panels the solid line encloses the 95% credible regions the blue stripes show the 
original values of the synthetic data which were used to create the data r = 12 km m = 15 m8 x = 0 and d = 6 kpc if the composition is known the radius is precisely recovered when x is a free parameter the 
prior limit of x > 0 and the correlation of m x and d with each other leads to asymmetric posteriors around the true value and so the inferred radius is a lower limit fig 4 mass and radius posteriors for 
synthetic data created for r = 12 km and m = 15 m8 which are shown here with cyan crosses the left panel shows a spectral t with xed emitting area s f = 1 and hydrogen mass fraction x = 0 model a the right 
panel shows a spectral t with a free hydrogen fraction x model b in both panels the dotted line encapsulates the 68% the dashed line the 95% and the solid line the 997% credible regions the dashed blue 
lines show values of constant redshift 1 + z = 12 and 13 the dotted orange lines are the contours of constant surface gravity log g = 140 143 and 146 the solid green line shows the critical radius r = 4gm 
c2 the dark orange region at the topleft corner marks the region of parameter space forbidden by the requirement of causality haensel et al 2007 lattimer & prakash 2007 the input m r point is within the 
95% credible regions in both cases even when the hydrogen mass fraction is a free parameter 
the eddington ux 12 what we observe directly is the num
ber of counts which is related to the photon number ux of the source by eq 13 because of this all of our parameters are interconnected in a complicated fashion in bayesian inference it is typical to study 
such a system by dening some information criterion and then to minimize its value given the t parameters this would then give us a description of the least informative often multidimensional priors we elect 
to instead impose simple unidimensional priors for the system based on experience with our analysis of synthetic data what we have found is that m x and d are the most tightly connected parameters in the 
system hence imposing a prior distribution for one of them will strongly aect the rest in this work we have decided to optimize our results for m and x at the cost of introducing a nonat prior for d based 
on our dierent test runs we concluded that a prior of p d d1 2 which therefore slightly favors larger values of d produces the least biased constraints for m and x 
this leads us to propose a fourth and nal model model d which is an extension of model b in model dthe hydrogen fraction x is a free parameter but we also incorporate intrinsic scat
fig 5 posterior distributions for the mcmc run with synthetic data for the model d with helium and solar compositions the red solid line in 
v the d panel shows the prior distribution d that we used other symbols and legends are the same as in fig 3 with the inclusion of the weak distance prior we see that the t is better at 
recovering the original values if the hydrogen mass fraction is not exactly zero the true r m and x are recovered when a correct family of solutions is considered in many cases the incorrect 
highmass smallradius family of solutions is easy to discard on a physical basis as it is close to or inside the region ruled out by causality fig 6 mass and radius posteriors for synthetic data 
created for r = 12 km and m = 15 m8 which are shown here with cyan crosses the left panel shows the results for a pure helium composition x = 0 whereas the right panel shows the results for a 
solar composition x = 073 the symbols and legends are the same as in fig 4 even with a free hydrogen mass fraction x the true m r values are now more consistent with the 
constraints coming from the ts 
ter sint into the analysis and choose p d d1 2 using these assumptions we recover the input parameters for the synthetic data without any signicant bias when x 0 this is evident in figs 
5 and 6 where we use model d with synthetic data that have x = 0 left hand panels of both gures and x = 073 right hand panels of both gures we nd that when x is not exactly 0 we are able to 
reproduce the input radius without bias additionally if the second cluster of solutions at high masses is neglected we also reproduce the input mass hydrogen fraction and distance in practice 
this can be done by imposing a mass cuto of m < 20 m8 or by selecting only the lowmass solutions below the critical radius r = 4gm c2 for a pure helium atmosphere the sharp boundary at x = 0 
leads to asymmetric posteriors around the real value and so the estimates are always biased towards smaller or larger values an additional check is that the intrinsic scatter is driven toward 
small values which it must be because we created the data without any additional scatter 
for pure helium x = 0 model a we constrain the radius to be r = 113 ± 04 07 km at 68% 95% credibility the 
12+02 04 
mass is similarly constrained to be m = m8 thus 
02 02 
the input values are inside the 95% credible intervals the dis
54 + 03 07 <= 
tance is found to be d = kpc the hydrogen mass 
04 05 
fraction is constrained to be x < 005 009 which is consistent with the input value x = 0 similarly for the synthetic j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 120+07 11 22+01 01 
fraction results are r = km m = m8
09 21 07 10 
69 + 03 04 059+016 033 
d = kpc and x = most importantly 
08 16 004 006 
we see that the correct radius is obtained without any bias if the second highmass cluster of solutions is omitted by asserting an 
120 + 06 10 <= 
additional m < 2 m8 prior we obtain r = km m = 
09 22 15+04 04 69+04 04 059+015 031 
m8 d = kpc and x = 
03 04 10 16 005 007 
in this case both the radius and the mass are correctly recovered with 09 km and 04 m8 precision respectively even accounting for the mass imprecision when the composition is pure helium model d is 
still the best of our models in producing precise and unbiased estimates of the parameters

the count rate decreases by a factor of approximately 2 we double the exposure time so that the number of counts in each bin remains relatively high the rxte data were also deadtime corrected see for 
example nättilä et al 2016 which was of course not necessary for the synthetic data one should also notice that unlike the synthetic data the real observations have a varying quality due to the varying 
number of pcus between the ve bursts ranging from 2 to 5 active pcus some sample spectra from one of the bursts are shown in fig 7 we also show the evolution of each individual spectral 
parameter of each burst in fig 8 just as with the synthetic data we see that the normal
ized luminosity grad g is well constrained and the evolution of this parameter is strikingly similar to its evolution in the mock data in the model cts we see that the surface emitting fraction 
is constrained to be very close to unity for the entirety of this burst which provides some evidence that the full surface emits close to uniformly in this case 
fig 8 evolution of the normalized luminosity grad g for burst #1 from 4u 1702429 the surface fraction s f constraints are also shown for model c which is the only one of our models in which this 
parameter is free the dotted black line with the scale on the right axis shows the corresponding standard deviation of the obtained parameter distributions the strength of the red coloring is 
proportional to the probability density the constraints we nd using this real rxte data bear a clear similarity to the constraints from our synthetic data ts seen in fig 2 
as a nal test of our atmosphere model goodnessoft we can study possible systematic deviations from the model spectra in an individual energy channel level in fig 9 we show the ratio of the data 
and the bestt model ux from the model drun together with a channelspecic value dened as dm s ie dierence between data d and model m in units of standard error s for each of the ve analyzed 
bursts additionally table 2 shows the sum of 2 values for the bestt models there do not appear to be any signicant persistent structures in the residuals there is a slight decit of ux 
around 10 14 kev in the burst tails which corresponds to a ~ 5% dierence between the model and the data ~ 04 no such features are seen in the synthetic data ts it is therefore possible 
that this decit has a physical origin we discuss these deviations further in sect 4 our total 2 for model d is 31035 with 2438 degrees of freedom reduced 2 of 127 for the set of all 5 bursts 
r 
when all spectral energy bins with counts less than 20 are ignored the quality of the t is however decreased drastically by the lowcount channels and if we instead select 50 as our channel 
count cuto we obtain 2 = 25410 with 2122 degrees of freedom 2 = 120 
r 
for our actual parameter constraints we consider only models a and d because model b produced somewhat biased constraints with synthetic data and model c has too much freedom in its 
parameters particularly with the inclusion of the surface emitting fraction sf as a free parameter fig 10 shows the full posterior distributions and fig 11 shows the twodimensional m r 
posterior distributions in more detail for each model the precision of constraints is similar to what it was for the synthetic data we nd that r = 124 ± 04 06 km and

notes each column reports the total 2 dof and the value in the parentheses is the reduced 2r for the 4u 1702429 the bestt values are 
m = 157 m8 r = 1217 km d = 547 kpc and x = 010 in the case of synthetic data we have m = 15 m8 r = 12 km d = 6 kpc and x = 0 
when computing the 2 values we require that the number of counts in each spectral energy bin exceeds 50 in contrast to the synthetic data the real bursts also have a nonzero intrinsic scatter of ln s2 = 32 
this corresponds to about int <= 
30 counts per second per energy channel in reality the intrinsic scatter accommodates more local deviations such as the ones between 10 14 kev as seen in fig 9 such an error in the observed counts reects 
a ~ 1 5% deviation from the model ux depending on the grad g value higher grad g corresponds to higher temperature ie larger count rate for which the deviation is closer to the 1% level whereas the opposite is 
true for a small grad g 
4 discussion 
the measurements we present here result from the use of full atmospheric spectral models of thermonuclear xray burst cooling rather than the usual use of diluted blackbody ts this gives us access to additional 
information via the surface redshift and the surface gravity our new method also allows us to validate many of the assumptions that underlie previous work for example we nd that the eddington limit is reached 
and exceeded near the beginning of the cooling tail see fig 8 that shows the t results for the rst burst in our sample the remaining 4 bursts are almost identical hence this is the most direct validation yet 
assuming that the atmosphere models are correct that at least the bursts that we analyze here are photospheric radius expansion bursts moreover the dependence of the spectral shape evolution on the atmosphere 
composition allows us for the rst time to set reliable limits on the hydrogen mass fraction in the photosphere this is made possible by the fact that the temperature evolution of the atmosphere is dependent on the 
composition 
41 uncertainties and systematic errors 
by tting the atmosphere models directly to the data we can also assess the degree to which the models represent the data although we reiterate our caveats about the use of 2 particularly for model comparisons see 
also andrae et al 2010 we note that the model d t to 4u 1702429 has 2 dof = 25410 2122 see also table 2 whereas for a simple blackbody t 2 dof = 27163 2010 the blackbody ts are obtained using xspec version 1291 
arnaud 1996 with bbodyrad model thus the model atmosphere t has an additional 112 degrees of freedom but its 2 is 1755 smaller this kind of comparison is however not strictly fair because individual blackbody bestts 
minimize the quoted 2 value for channels with more than 50 counts whereas the results from the hierarchical modeling are obtained from the mcmc chain that deals with full poisson or gaussian likelihoods the bestt 
values are also very susceptible to the exact energy range used for the t and so the 2 values reported here are only indicative when an extra 05% calibration error is introduced as is advised for rxte spectral 
analysis shaposhnikov et al 2012 the 2 value also decreases in both cases by about 30 the main dierence here that we want to emphasize is that blackbody ts involve two parameters per spectrum temperature and 
normalization whereas direct spec
v in figs 3 and 5 the red solid line in the d panel shows the prior distribution d that we used both models are seen to produce posterior shapes that are similar to what we found in our synthetic 
data ts fig 5 both models also produce consistent estimates for the radius and distance tral tting only has grad g as a parameter for each spectrum this is true for models a b and d for model c 
the surface emitting fraction is also a free parameter for each spectrum in addition to the individual spectrum parameters there are 3 to 5 global parameters and thus the total number of model 
parameters is 1 × 116 + [ 3 4 ] mass radius distance and hydrogen mass fraction in some cases this means that when compared with the blackbody model the atmosphere model is able to reduce 
the number of parameters needed from ~ 230 to roughly 120 while retaining comparable accuracy 
nonetheless the formal statistical t is not good and this is reected in the nonzero value of sint in our model d ts hence it appears that there are unmodeled eects in the data an obvious candidate 
for such complications is the rotation of the star 
however because 4u 1702429 has a relatively small rotational frequency of 329 hz markwardt et al 1999 the eects are unlikely to be large for this star our preliminary studies show that the eect of 
rotational broadening of the spectrum is strongest at low and high energies and hence broadening might account for some of the deviations seen at e 3 kev and e >~ 12 kev in fig 9 the impact on the t 
quality ie 2 on the other hand is small because rotational broadening tends to smooth out the spectra without producing any sharp features nättilä & piha
joki 2017 hence disentangling the eects of rotation from the atmosphere model ts based on the t quality alone is hard 
as is the case for rotational smearing we cannot detect if there is nonuniform surface emission in the sense that the temperature varies across the surface this is because our model c j nättilä et al 
atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
which has a free surface emitting fraction s f can only capture eects where some part of the star is partially covered there have been detections of burst oscillations from 4u 1702429 that imply a 
nonuniform surface temperature markwardt et al 1999 galloway et al 2008 ootes et al 2017 however these have been detected only during the soft state bursts from this particular source ootes et al 
2017 and so it could be that the eect if it exists is small because it cannot be detected using rxte data 
another possible source of error is the treatment of heavy elements in the atmosphere nättilä et al 2015 showed that heavy elements can have a signicant impact on burst spectra most importantly heavy 
elements produce photoionization edges around e ~ 9 14 kev the metals are likely to originate from nuclear burning during the burst and might be brought to the surface layers of the star by convection 
weinberg et al 2006 malone et al 2011 2014 the spectral deviations are expected to appear mainly when the metals start to recombine at lower temperatures after the photosphere has cooled down the 
detection of such features in other sources with longer more energetic bursts in’t zand & weinberg 2010 kajava et al 2017b implies that they might also play some role in the shorter bursts analyzed here 
a third possible source of deviations involves the persistent nonburst emission which we currently assume to be constant during the t some recent studies indicate that this might not be the case even 
in the hard state ji et al 2015 degenaar et al 2016 kajava et al 2017c however the initial level of per
sistent emission for the 5 bursts from 4u 170242 is very low and we expect this eect to not have a very signicant impact on the observed radiation a crude estimate can be obtained by varying the 
background emission not with the full hierarchical model but with individual blackbody ts in this case the constraints come from the eddington limit and from the normalization ktail = rbb [ km ] d10 2 
in the burst tail here rbb is the black body radius r and d10 = d 10 kpc by varying the background emission with factors ranging from 05 to 2 we obtain constraints where the eddington ux is still 
accurately recovered but the apparent normalization in the tail is decreased or increased respectively the value of the normalization in the tail in this case is within 2% of the original value this 
is consistent with the fact that the persistent emission during the hard state is about 1% of the eddington ux whereas in the tail f ~ 05fedd and so a 2% scatter in the normalization k is expected as 
f = kt 4 the measured radius r scales roughly for the xed compactness as r t 4 
edd8 ktail fedd see eg eq a9 in poutanen et al 2014 so such a deviation in the normalization results in a ~ 2% scatter in the radius this means that uncertainty related to the persistent emission would 
then translate to about 250 m absolute error in our measured radius 
the nal possible source of error is the neutral hydrogen column density it only aects the lowenergy channels of rxte which can have an impact on the parameters deduced late in the burst tail near the 
eddington limit the radiation peaks at e ~ 10 kev but when the ns cools down the bulk of the thermal radiation moves to lower energies hence the eect is similar to the aforementioned persistent emission 
where the main eect is on the normalization in the tail of the burst when the value of nh is decreased the modeled lowenergy radiation is aected less by the absorption and so the inferred value 
of the normalization in the tail also decreases because the model ux is now higher unfortunately it is also in the rayleighjeans tail that the surface gravity of the atmosphere models has the 
greatest eect on the emergent spectra similar considerations as in the persistent emission case show that varying nh by a factor of 2 leads to an error in ktail of 5% that then translates to 
similar relative error in radius we do however note that the measured nh is usually obtained by other instruments that operate at lower xray energies where it is easier to measure the neutral 
hydrogen column density hence an uncertainty of a factor of 2 is certainly overestimating the error related to the value 
our consideration of error sources leads us to propose that the emission above f 05fedd should be the cleanest option for m r measurements however the high ux near f ~ fedd is not free of 
problems early in the cooling tail the count rates from the source are highest and so the detector is aected by the deadtime correction the most deadtime correction near the peak can be as high as 5% 
which would directly translate to error in the measured fedd this would again translate to similar uncertainty in the radius in reality of course the deadtime correction scheme proposed by the instrument 
calibration team should be quite eective at covering this eect and so errors as large as 5% originating from this are not expected to be safe the uxes between 05095 fedd should give the most stringent 
constraints this however decreases the amount of available data even more and for example here in this work we pushed the aforementioned limits to cover grad g = 02 098 that we still think are viable 
another option would be to try to model the varying background emission and also marginalize over some plausible hydrogen column density range to capture all of the known error sources it 
would be useful to perform such an analysis in the future all in all this shows that we are approaching the absolute measuring accuracy of the rxte satellite 
the bestt results are also robust against any systematic calibration error in the ux normalization because the constraints for r mainly originate from fedd and ktail in contrast to the 
redshift 1 + z and surface gravity g which have a much weaker eect the radius is mainly constrained by the temperature evolution of the burst only for an unknown systematic energyindependent 
shift aecting the observed spectra we still obtain r ktail fedd ktail kt4 1 t 4 where tedd8 is
edd8 edd8
the eddington temperature see eq a9 in poutanen et al 2014 and eq 12 this is a distanceindependent quantity which makes the derived radius independent of any normalization factor aecting the 
observed ux 
42 comparison and robustness of the constraints 
it is also interesting to compare our analysis of the 4u 1702429 bursts to previous constraints that were obtained using the cooling tail method by applying the cooling tail method to the same set of 
hardstate bursts that we analyze here nättilä et al 2016 measured the ns radius to be r ˜ 13 km for m = 15 m8 however their m r posteriors have a complicated bananalike shape see gure 4 in nättilä et al 
2016 and thus the in
ferred radius depends strongly on the assumed mass nättilä et al 2016 found that introducing priors on the eos leads to better constraints on the mass that is the assumption that all of the sources 
analyzed in nättilä et al 2016 in addition to 4u 1702429 they used 4u 1724307 and sax j181082609 originate from the same underlying eos helps pin down the mass they nd that at 68% probability m = 18 
± 03 m8 and r = 119 ±06 km assuming no phase transitions qmc+model a in their paper these constraints are in a good agreement with the values derived here which from model d are m ˜ 19 m8 and r ˜ 124 
km the compositions are also in good agreement nättilä et al 2016 assumed a pure helium composition x = 0 whereas here the t itself shows that x < 009 68% the distance constraints also agree well d = 
56 ± 09 kpc versus 55±04 kpc for the cooling tail and the direct spectral tting methods model a respectively note that our m r results are located away from the critical radius r = 4gm c2 see özel & 
psaltis 2015 for discussion if the constraints from fedd and a ktail are not consistent with each other3 then the mr solution is forced to obey this relation because no real solution exists this 
could happen for example if the model is applied to data that it does not describe such as data from softstate bursts where the behaviour of the cooling tail might not be totally determined by the 
ns surface alone see steiner et al 2010 poutanen et al 2014 kajava et al 2014 nättilä et al 2016 
if the true values of m and r are close to the r = 4gm c2 relation then it is very hard to distinguish this correct solution from an incorrect solution that is forced upon the system by a model 
that is inconsistent with the data hence if all of the mr solutions from multiple sources are located only at this line seeözel et al 2016 for such a situation it either means that the model is 
applied inconsistently to data that it does not describe or that all nss happen to have the same compactness m r = c2 4g 
another interesting aspect of our method is its ability to constrain the composition of the atmosphere as can be seen from the synthetic data ts it is possible to set limits for x with about 10% 
precision at 68% credibility this opens up a whole new window to the study of accretion physics because we can correlate the burst behavior against the composition of the accreted matter one should 
however note that the composition we probe here is the composition during the burst and so in theory the nuclear reprocessing might change the true composition during the measurement 
although x = 0 is still consistent with the data we can ask whether other aspects of the 4u 1702429 bursts are consistent with there being some hydrogen in the atmosphere one such consistency 
check involves the ratio of the uence of the persistent emission between bursts to the burst uence itself this ratio which is usually called a is a measure of the ratio of the gravitational specic 
energy release to the thermonuclear energy release because hydrogen fusion releases much more energy than helium fusion we expect a to be larger when there is less hydrogen present for 4u 1702429 
a ˜ 75 galloway et al 2008 whereas for 4u 1820303 a is in the range 125–155 haberl et al 1987 the neutron star in 4u 1820303 is usually assumed to have a nearly pure helium atmosphere cumming 2003 
so the lower value of a in 4u 1702429 is consistent with the presence of some hydrogen in the latter source note however that the values of a quoted here are the minimum values and might change from 
burst to burst bursts from 4u 1820303 also exhibit a fast rise and have short timescales both of which are believed to be consequences of fast helium burning whereas the 4u 1702429 bursts have longer 
durations and also longer rise times galloway et al 2008 neither of these ndings is con
clusive but they do point into the same direction there should be some traces of hydrogen in the 4u 1702429 atmosphere as is suggested by our analysis 
3 together fedd and a set the normalization of the model spectra because both depend on the distance they both rely on the assumption that it is only the ns surface that is emitting if this assumption 
is invalid then the observed values might not coincide with the theoretical values 
43 future prospects 
it is interesting to consider additional possibilities that are suggested by our new and detailed analysis one obvious extension is to include the pre phase in our tting to do this however we will need 
accurate atmosphere models of extended ns photospheres the advantage would be to increase the available data for analysis and it should also signicantly improve the measurements of m and r because the 
expansion must be heavily dependent on the redshift z and surface gravity g preliminary work into this direction has already been reported in medin et al 2016 their work also allows an independent 
validation of our atmosphere models our results agree well with theirs in the range grad g ˜ 02 1 implying that at least in the context of the mutual assumptions set by both computations the results 
are reproducible 
another important but computationally very expensive future prospect is to t all possible xray bursts to obtain m r constraints this would help to set groundbreaking constraints on the eos of the dense 
matter preliminary studies already validate the previous results that the atmosphere models are not applicable to the soft state bursts poutanen et al 2014 kajava et al 2014 lastly it is also 
important to understand why the models do not agree completely with the data and the physical origin of these deviations for this more work is needed in order to understand the physics and 
environments of the bursts better 
despite the uncertainty about the mass we have improved signicantly the constraints on the compactness of the neutron star our mass and radius measurements are encouragingly consistent with 
recent theoretical analyses of the eos of cold dense matter lattimer & prakash 2016 such a result give hope on the possibility of using astrophysical neutron star measurements to constrain 
better the behavior of the ultradense matter 
5 summary 
we have presented the rst direct atmosphere model spectral ts to thermonuclear xray burst cooling tails our method is a generalization of previous work in which black body parameters were used as a 
proxy to trace the evolution of the energy spectrum by tting the atmosphere models directly to the data we are able to extract more information from the data and also to test some of the physical 
assumptions made in previous analyses 
we nd that ts to synthetic data which are generated using the same model that we employ for our analyses reveal as expected a lack of bias and also show the prospects for precise measurements of the 
mass and radius when we apply our tting procedure to rxte data from ve hardstate typei xray bursts from 4u 1702429 in sect 32 the resulting posteriors bear a clear similarity to the synthetic data 
although the formal quality of the ts is worse than in the ideal case when we articially add intrinsic noise in our analysis of the 4u 1702429 data to produce a formally good t we nd that the radius 
is constrained to be r = 124 ± 04 km at 68% credibility for both models we employ the source distance is constrained to be between 
51 kpc < d < 62 kpc 68% combined credibility limits from model a and d we nd that the hydrogen mass fraction x for 4u 1702429 can be constrained to x < 009 at 68% credibility the highestprobability 
value is x = 006 rather than x = 0 
the mass seems to be the hardest parameter to constrain when we apply our two models to synthetic data model a typically underestimates m by ~ 01 m8 whereas model d shows even stronger underestimation 
for atmospheres with no hydroj nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
gen in them when x > 0 model d is seen to reproduce the mass when applied to synthetic data our analysis of the rxte data for 4u 1702429 yields similar results model a gives m = 14 ± 02 m8 whereas model 
dgives m = 19 ± 03 m8 if a bias similar to what we nd when analyzing synthetic data applies to the 4u 1702429 analysis then the real mass is expected to lie closer to the model d constraints we 
suggest therefore that the 95% credible interval of model d is a trustworthy limit and in this limit we nd that the mass for 4u 1702429 lies in the range 14 < m m8 < 22

what is an lvdt ? 
the letters lvdt are an acronym for linear variable differential 
transformer a common type of electromechanical transducer 
that can convert the rectilinear motion of an object to which it is 
coupled mechanically into a corresponding electrical signal lvdt 
linear position sensors are readily available that can measure 
movements as small as a few millionths of an inch up to several 
inches but are also capable of measuring positions up to ± 20 
inches ( ±0 5 m ) 
figure 1 shows the components of a typical lvdt the 
transformer’s internal structure consists of a primary winding 
centered between a pair of identically wound secondary windings 
symmetrically spaced about the primary the coils are wound on 
a one - piece hollow form 
of thermally stable glass reinforced polymer encapsulated 
against moisture wrapped in a high permeability magnetic shield 
and then secured in a cylindrical stainless steel housing this coil
assembly is usually the stationary element of the position sensor 
the moving element of an lvdt is a separate tubular armature 
of magnetically permeable material called the core which is free 
to move axially within the coil’s hollow bore and mechanically 
coupled to the object whose position is being measured this 
bore is typically large enough to provide substantial radial 
clearance between the core and bore with no physical contact 
between it and the coil 
in operation the lvdt’s primary winding is energized by 
alternating current of appropriate amplitude and frequency known 
as the primary excitation the lvdt’s electrical output signal is 
the differential ac voltage between the two secondary windings 
which varies with the axial position of the core within the lvdt 
coil usually this ac output voltage is converted by suitable 
electronic circuitry to high level dc voltage ( 0 - 5v ) or current 
 ( 4 - 20ma ) or digital ( rs - 485 ) signal that is more convenient to use 
stainless steel housing and end caps

how does an lvdt work 
figure 2 illustrates what happens when the lvdt’s core is 
in different axial positions the lvdt’s primary winding p is 
energized by a constant amplitude ac source the magnetic flux 
thus developed is coupled by the core to the adjacent secondary 
windings s1 and s2 if the core is located midway between s1 and 
s2 equal flux is coupled to each secondary so the voltages e1 
and e2 induced in windings s1 and s2 respectively are equal at 
this reference midway core position known as the null point the 
differential voltage output ( e1 - e2 ) is essentially zero 
as shown in figure 2 if 
the core is moved closer to 
s1 than to s2 more flux is 
coupled to s1 and less to 
s2 so the induced voltage 
e1 is increased while e2 is 
decreased resulting in the 
differential voltage ( e1 - e2 ) 
conversely if the core is 
moved closer to s2 more flux 
is coupled to s2 and less to 
s1 so e2 is increased as e1 
is decreased resulting in the
differential voltage ( e2 - e1 ) 
figure 3a shows how the 
magnitude of the differential 
output voltage eout varies 
with core position the 
value of eout at maximum 
core displacement from null 
depends upon the amplitude 
of the primary excitation 
voltage and the sensitivity 
factor of the particular lvdt 
but is typically several volts 
rms the phase angle of this ac output voltage eout referenced 
to the primary excitation voltage stays constant until the center 
of the core passes the null point where the phase angle changes 
abruptly by 180 degrees as shown graphically in figure 3b 
this 180 degree phase shift can be used to determine the 
direction of the core from the null point by means of appropriate 
circuitry this is shown in figure 3c where the polarity of the 
output signal represents the core’s positional relationship to the 
null point the figure shows also that the output of an lvdt is 
very linear over its specified range of core motion but that the 
sensor can be used over an extended range with some reduction 
in output linearity 
figure 3 
the output characteristics of an lvdt vary with different positions of the core 
full range output is a large signal typically a volt or more and often requires no 
amplification note that an lvdt continues to operate beyond 100% of full 
range but with degraded linearity

lvdt support electronics 
although an lvdt is an electrical transformer it requires ac 
power of an amplitude and frequency quite different from ordinary 
power lines to operate properly ( typically 3 vrms at 3 khz ) 
supplying this excitation power for an lvdt is one of several 
functions of lvdt support electronics which is also sometimes 
known as lvdt signal conditioning equipment 
other functions include converting the lvdt’s low level ac 
voltage output into high level dc signals that are more convenient 
to use decoding directional information from the 180 degree 
output phase shift as an lvdt’s core moves through the null 
point and providing an electrically adjustable output zero level 
a variety of lvdt signal conditioning electronics is available 
including chip - level and board - level products for oem 
applications as well as modules and complete laboratory 
instruments for users 
the support electronics can also be self - contained as in the dclvdt 
shown in figure 4 these easy - to - use position transducers 
offer practically all of the lvdt’s benefits with the simplicity 
of dc - in dc - out operation of course lvdts with integral 
electronics may not be suitable for some applications or might 
not be packaged appropriately for some installation environments 
figure 5 is an example of an lvdt signal conditioner that accepts 
an ac output signal from the sensor and converts it to analog 
voltage current or digital outputs 
why use an lvdt ? 
lvdts have certain significant features and benefits most of 
which derive from its fundamental physical principles of operation 
or from the materials and techniques used in its construction 
friction - free operation 
one of the most important features of an lvdt is its friction - free 
operation in normal use there is no mechanical contact between 
the lvdt’s core and coil assembly so there is no rubbing 
dragging or other source of friction this feature is particularly 
useful in materials testing vibration displacement measurements 
and high resolution dimensional gaging systems 
infinite resolution 
since an lvdt operates on electromagnetic coupling principles 
in a friction - free structure it can measure infinitesimally small 
changes in core position this infinite resolution capability is 
limited only by the noise in an lvdt signal conditioner and the 
output display’s resolution these same factors also give an lvdt 
its outstanding repeatability 
unlimited mechanical life 
because there is normally no contact between the lvdt’s 
core and coil structure no parts can rub together or wear 
out this means that an lvdt features unlimited mechanical 
life this factor is especially important in high reliability 
applications such as aircraft satellites and space vehicles and 
nuclear installations it is also highly desirable in many industrial 
process control and factory automation systems 
signal conditioning electronics module

the cross sectional view of the dc - lvdt at left shows the built - in 
signal conditioning electronics module the module is secured with 
a potting compound that is not shown in this drawing figure 5

overtravel damage resistant 
the internal bore of most lvdts is open at both ends in the 
event of unanticipated overtravel the core is able to pass 
completely through the sensor coil assembly without causing 
damage this invulnerability to position input overload makes an 
lvdt the ideal sensor for applications like extensometers that are 
attached to tensile test samples in destructive materials testing apparatus 
single axis sensitivity 
an lvdt responds to motion of the core along the coil’s axis 
but is generally insensitive to cross - axis motion of the core or to 
its radial position thus an lvdt can usually function without 
adverse effect in applications involving misaligned or floating 
moving members and in cases where the core doesn’t travel in a 
precisely straight line 
separable coil and core 
because the only interaction between an lvdt’s core and coil 
is magnetic coupling the coil assembly can be isolated from the 
core by inserting a non - magnetic tube between the core and the 
bore by doing so a pressurized fluid can be contained within the 
tube in which the core is free to move while the coil assembly 
is unpressurized this feature is often utilized in lvdts used for 
spool position feedback in hydraulic proportional and/or servo valves 
environmentally robust 
the materials and construction techniques used in assembling an 
lvdt result in a rugged durable sensor that is robust to a variety 
of environmental conditions bonding of the windings is followed 
by epoxy encapsulation into the case resulting in superior 
moisture and humidity resistance as well as the capability to 
take substantial shock loads and high vibration levels in all axes 
and the internal high - permeability magnetic shield minimizes the 
effects of external ac fields 
both the case and core are made of corrosion resistant metals 
with the case also acting as a supplemental magnetic shield and 
for those applications where the sensor must withstand exposure 
to flammable or corrosive vapors and liquids or operate in 
pressurized fluid the case and coil assembly can be hermetically 
sealed using a variety of welding processes 
ordinary lvdts can operate over a very wide temperature 
range but if required they can be produced to operate down 
to cryogenic temperatures or using special materials operate 
at the elevated temperatures and radiation levels found in many 
nuclear reactors 
null point repeatibility 
the location of an lvdt’s intrinsic null point is extremely stable 
and repeatable even over its very wide operating temperature 
range this makes an lvdt perform well as a null position sensor 
in closed - loop control systems and highperformance servo 
balance instruments 
fast dynamic response 
the absence of friction during ordinary operation permits an lvdt 
to respond very fast to changes in core position the dynamic 
response of an lvdt sensor itself is limited only by the inertial 
instrument utilization: the missing piece of asset management

conclusion l
aboratories are the engines of innovation: from pharmaceuticals to chemicals academia to oil & gas labs produce the insights and discoveries that move the world forward over the past three decades 
laboratories across the globe - from r&d to quality control - have experienced rapid changes new demands from the marketplace personnel changes and added equipment has fueled a dynamic laboratory environment 
however a consequence of this growth is the addition of instrumentation and capital equipment 
instrument utilization 
for lab managers these changes results in an exponential increase in responsibilities nowadays as labs seek to become more productive flexible and competitive managing their instrumentation and capital equipment is 
top of mind the traditional components of managing assets like asset tracking provide overburdened lab managers with better access to equipment information such capabilities serve as the foundation for an effective 
asset management process yet as priorities evolve labs seek to become more flexible ensure access to the best capabilities and decrease costs 
to satisfy these requirements however lab managers and executives lack the operational insight required to make the best decisions which instruments require service contracts ? which instruments should we purchase 
more of ? which instruments should be redeployed ? if they are to be redeployed to whom ? 
institutions are often left guessing how best to manage their myriad of capital equipment and where to allocate limited resources the key to making the best capital equipment decisions is instrument utilization data 
on instrument utilization provides lab managers and executives with real tangible data on the usage of instrumentation at any point in time 
2 - implications 
during times of growth questions of productivity and efficiency were rarely raised however as the marketplace demands lower - cost innovations and r&d managers are being pressed to improve capital efficiency 
enterprise asset management emerges as an opportunity to improve laboratory operations an average - sized laboratory for a large pharmaceutical company for instance with 300 scientists would hold between 1 000 – 2 000 
pieces of capital equipment at any point in time the cost to maintain that equipment the corresponding service contracts depreciation expenses for the fleet and unnecessary equipment purchases can exceed $10mm per year 
3 - solutions 
the best hope to mitigate these recurrent costs and to make better decisions about capital equipment is to obtain accurate utilization data from laboratory instruments 
the limitations to obtaining this valuable data to date are numerous: an unmanageable quantity of capital equipment limited utilization reporting instruments spread across multiple labs limited personnel time and 
supplier fragmentation to name a few 

the missing piece of asset management 
the aforementioned realities of managing capital equipment results in a lack of good data on instrument utilization thus far the most common methods for obtaining utilization data are: 
anecdotes paper log books 
multi - vendor supported software 
internet - of - things enabled technology 
3 - 1 anecdotes 
in labs large and small the most common way to obtain information on instrument usage is to simply ask lab managers in smaller laboratories can easily walk around engage with users directly and aggregate data when 
needed however all executives and lab managers can appreciate the limitations of this approach anecdotes are great for storytelling - not making data - driven decisions 
furthermore anecdotes provide a limited picture of usage and are only accurate for one point - in - time as labs expand and become geographically more spread out lab managers are unable to solicit sufficient feedback 
across the laboratory to gain a complete picture of equipment utilization 
figure 1 - utilization data from anecdotes 
pros 	cons 
fast & easy ( for unreliable data small labs ) 
 	
difficult to obtain across large laboratories 

data relevant at only a single point - in - time instrument utilization 
a common approach in academia lab managers use paper - based log books and clipboards for usage tracking this solution is simple paper log books serve as a simple way to capture data at every run for every instrument 
furthermore to implement such a system is also low cost lastly it is easy for scientists to learn and use 
despite the simplicity of this approach paper log books are difficult to maintain and have glaring gaps first and foremost the integrity of the data of paper - based logs is dependent upon complete compliance by the 
scientist - often a tall order second lab managers are subsequently responsible for collecting periodically all log books and manually entering data from each log book into a computer ( e g a spreadsheet ) this 
approach is cumbersome prone to error and a rote task lastly paper log books can be misplaced smudged or otherwise obscured 

figure 2 - utilization data from paper log books 
pros cons simple scientists ignore them low - cost 
manual data entry little training required not real - time 
figure 3 - paper log books haven’t changed for hundreds of years 
the missing piece of asset management 
for large companies with many laboratories and tens - of - thousands of pieces of capital equipment multi - vendor instrument services are used companies like thermo scientific perkinelmer and agilent have divisions of 
their businesses that provide a single entity that manages and maintains equipment in large laboratories these organizations that provide multi - vendor services namely unity lab services onesource and crosslab have 
developed capabilities to quantify instrument utilization for capital equipment their utilization products help labs quantify how often instruments are used 
labs find value in this reporting as these products provide current and historical view of instrument usage these vendors claim that any instrument that is operated by a computer can be assessed using their products 
furthermore their technology can also extract critical parameters like the number of injections from an autosampler as a consequence however of all instruments in the laboratory only a third are operated by computers 
instruments like ultracentrifuges could not be measured using these products second to obtain utilization data a laboratory must install software on each and every computer such a process is time - intensive and comes 
at great burden on it staff 
figure 4 - utilization data from multi - vendor software 
pros 
quantifies utilization for capital equipment automatically 
provides certain usage - level data like quantity of runs 
cons 
requires software to be installed on every computer 	
it administrators must allow scientific data to be exposed to multi - service vendors 
only works on a subset of lab instrumentation 
real - time instrument usage not possible 
figure 5 - illustration of multi - vendor instrument software 
instrument utilization 
recently a new breed of technology has emerged that enables remote monitoring & data capture for instrumentation and sensors this internet - of - things ( iot ) technology has been deployed in the home ( e g nest ) and 
now is creating value in laboratory environments companies like boston ma - based tetrascience inc ( www tetrascience com ) are pioneering how connectivity and modern software can improve scientific productivity and 
efficiency by using simple sensors tetrascience’s technology enables labs to quantify instrument utilization report analytics across an entire fleet and provide users with a real - time dashboard of instrument 
availability this technology can work with over 90% of laboratory instruments and is instrument agnostic vendor agnostic and is secure 
figure 6 - illustration of internet - of - things ecosystems 
figure 7 - utilization data from iot technology 
pros 
quantifies utilization on over 90% of laboratory equipment 
provides real - time view of instrument availability 
on demand reporting 
analytics and insights across fleets of instrumentation 
simple 15 minute setup 
cons 
does not examine scientific data or files 
the missing piece of asset management 
instrumentation is a critical component of the modern laboratories as modern research and laboratory workflows evolve the usage of different instrumentation ebbs and flows these changes are hard to predict or 
quantify and have substantial impact on how laboratories should manage assets asset tracking and preventative maintenance serve as the foundation for best practices in asset management however the usage of existing 
r&d assets need to be considered when making new equipment - related investments the lynchpin to making sound capital equipment purchasing decisions is to obtain real - time instrument utilization data 
at present the conventional approaches to obtaining utilization are imperfect - anecdotes paper logs multi - vendor support software - and require substantial time or burden to implement however new technologies that 
leverage cloud - based software and connected sensors like that offered by tetrascience provides real - time data and sophisticated analytics ultimately the future of laboratories is one where real - time data drives 
productivity efficiency and flexibility in scientific workflows 

the home winemakers manual 
lum eisenman 
preface 
most home winemaking books are written like cookbooks they contain winemaking recipes and step by step directions but little technical information is 
included the goal of these books is to provide enough information so the reader can make a successful batch of wine enology textbooks are the other 
extreme they are very technical and can be difficult to comprehend without a background in chemistry and microbiology these books are intended to 
give professional winemakers the specialized backgrounds needed to solve the wide variety of problems encountered in commercial wine production 
this book is an attempt to provide beginning home winemakers with basic how to instructions as well as providing an introduction to some of the more technical aspects of 
winemaking however the technical material has been concentrated in a few chapters so readers can easily ignore much of the technical content until an interest develops 
if you have a quantity of fresh grapes to convert into wine read chapter 1 and the first few pages of appendix a this material will give you enough information to 
start a successful grape wine fermentation appendix a is written in a quasi outline form and it provides a brief description of the entire winemaking process 
if you have some fresh fruit and wish to make wine before the fruit spoils read chapter 21 this is a stand alone chapter and successful fruit wines can be made from the information 
provided here the first few pages provide enough information to prepare the fruit and start fermentation the rest of the chapter can then be read at your leisure 
chapters 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 12 14 15 and 17 provide general information on home winemaking these chapters discuss materials facilities equipment and basic processes much of this material is basic and should be of interest to most readers 
the material presented in chapters 5 6 11 13 and 16 is a bit more advanced these five chapters focus mostly on what and why rather than on how beginning winemakers may wish to skip these chapters until they become more experienced 
chapters 18 and 19 are case studies of making a red and white wine these two chapters provide a detailed chronology of the production of two typical wines 
chapter 20 describes hot to make small quantities of sparkling wine and chapter 22 contains practical how to information of general interest 
chapter 23 describes six common laboratory wine tests the significance of the tests materials apparatus and procedures are discussed 
i hope you enjoy my little book on home winemaking

chapter 1 

the winemaking process 
winemaking can be divided into four basic phases the first phase consists of finding a source of high quality fruit and making sure the grapes are harvested 
in an optimum condition buying small quantities of high quality fruit is not easy and this is the most difficult winemaking phase for home winemakers 
the second phase consists of fermenting the grapes into wine winemakers manage the fermentation by controlling several different fermentation parameters such as temperature skin contact time pressing technique etc 
during the third phase the new wine is clarified and stabilized winemakers clarify wine by fining racking and filtration wine is stabilized by removing excessive 
protein and potassium hydrogen tartrate potassium bi tartrate these materials must be removed to prevent them from precipitating out of the wine later 
in the fourth phase of winemaking the winemaker ages the wine most high quality wines are aged in bulk and then for an additional time in the bottle winemakers have 
an active role throughout the lengthy bulk aging process wines are smelled tasted and measured every few weeks and any needed adjustments are made promptly 
except for the first phase the other three winemaking phases overlap each other new wine starts to clarify toward the end of the fermentation period some tartrates precipitate out during primary fermentation and the 
wine becomes more stable of course wine is aging throughout the winemaking process each phase makes a specific contribution to wine characteristics but the first phase has the greatest influence on wine quality 
red wines and white wines 
high quality red wine grapes have colorless juice all of the red color is in the grape skins and winemakers must leave the juice in contact with the skins for a considerable time to extract the color red wine is made 
by crushing the grapes and then fermenting the juice the pulp the skins and the seeds together for several days near the end of sugar fermentation a wine press is used to separate the liquid from the solid materials 
white wine is made by a different process first the grapes are crushed and pressed immediately to separate the juice from the solids after pressing the skins stems and seeds are discarded and the juice 
is cooled to a low temperature then the cold juice is allowed to settle for several hours and the clear juice is decanted off the residue before it is fermented white wine is made by fermenting 
clarified juice these are the fundamental differences between making quality red wine and white wine at first glance the two winemaking processes may appear similar because several steps are 
identical nevertheless the steps are done in a different sequence and the sequence makes a large change in wine characteristics the two processes are shown in figure 1 in the vineyard 
it has often been said that wine quality is made in the vineyard and few experienced winemakers disagree with this statement the red wine process
soil climate the viticulture and all other aspects of the vineyard crush ferment 
environment contribute to the quality of the wine even if the press clarify 
winemaker does a perfect job the quality of the starting grapes stabilize age 
always determines the potential quality of the wine grape quality bottle 
is extremely important many winemakers feel that when a grape growing problem develops the difficulty must be recognized and 

white wine process
promptly resolved to assure fruit quality consequently both crush press 
professional and amateur winemakers prefer to grow their own settle ferment 
grapes then they have complete control over the vineyards 
clarify stabilize age bottle fermentation 
figure 1 red wines and white wine are produced using
two different fermentations occur in most red wines and these 
different winemaking processes 
same fermentations are often encouraged in heavier styled white wines like chardonnay or sauvignon blanc in addition a variety of yeast and bacteria can grow in wine and many of these microorganisms can cause other fermentations 
primary fermentation 
conversion of the two major grape sugars glucose and fructose into ethyl alcohol is called primary fermentation yeast in the wine produce enzymes and the enzymes convert the sugars 
into alcohol converting grape sugars into alcohol is not a simple process many steps are involved in this transformation and the yeast must produce several different enzymes 
malolactic fermentation 
malic acid in the grapes is converted into lactic acid during the secondary fermentation the necessary enzymes are produced by bacteria 
rather than by yeast several different types of bacteria can produce malolactic ml fermentation and these bacteria are called 
lactic bacteria lactic acid is weaker than malic acid so malolactic fermentation reduces the overall acidity of the wine in 
addition some byproducts produced during the ml fermentation can make a positive contribution to the complexity of the wine 
other fermentations 
depending upon the winemaking conditions several other fermentations can and often do occur in wine some bacteria can ferment the glycerol in the wine into lactic and acetic acids the natural 
grape sugars can be transformed into lactic and acetic acid by other types of bacteria a few species of bacteria can ferment the tartaric acid in the wine into lactic acid acetic acid and 
carbon dioxide gas vinegar bacteria can convert the alcohol into acetic acid then the same bacteria convert the acetic acid into water and carbon dioxide gas these other transformations 
can produce materials that detract from wine quality sometimes these undesirable fermentations can be devastating and when such fermentations occur wine is often called diseased or sick 
during the fermentation phase the primary function of the winemaker is to make sure that the primary and secondary fermentations take place in a controlled 
and judicious way making sure the unwanted fermentations do not occur is also important so the wine is measured smelled and tasted often 
clarification & stabilization 
at the end of the primary fermentation the new wine contains many spent yeast cells several different types of bacteria tartrate crystals small fragments of grape tissue bits of 
dirt etc all these particles interact with light that passes through the new wine the particles absorb or scatter the light and they give the wine an opaque turbid appearance 
gravity will slowly pull most of these particles down to the bottom of the wine container then the winemaker can decant the clear wine off the sediment 
the larger sized particles may settle out in a day or two but smaller particles may take several weeks to fall some suspended material may be so small 
it never completely settles out of the wine after gravity has removed most of the impurities from the wine the winemaker may add a fining material to 
help the settling process alternatively most commercial winemakers would choose to filter the wine and mechanically remove the remaining particles 
at this stage of its evolution the wine may be clear and bright but the wine probably is not completely stable in other words the wine may not remain in a clear 
condition over an extended time most wines contain excessive amounts of protein and potassium hydrogen tartrate when wine is stored under certain conditions 
the protein and the tartrate can precipitate out of the wine and produce a haze or a sediment any white or blush wine will probably be a total loss if either of 
these materials precipitates after the wine has been bottled wine stability is very important to the winemaker because of the protein and tartrate problems 
several techniques have been developed to remove excessive amounts of protein and tartrate from wine and these procedures are part of the normal winemaking process after the excess protein and tartrate materials have 
been removed the wine will be chemically stable then the winemaker can continue 21the winemaking process with reasonable assurance that the wine will remain clear and bright after it has been bottled wine aging 
odors in the wine that came directly from the grapes are called wine aroma bouquet is the term used for the odors in the wine produced by the winemaking process and winemakers use the term nose when 
referring to both the aroma and the bouquet components aroma 
wine aromas come from the grapes aromas do not result from the winemaking process cabernet sauvignon wine smells like cabernet sauvignon because of specific aromatic materials 
in that particular variety of grape the grassy aroma so characteristic of sauvignon blanc wine is a consequence of the grape variety not the winemaking process bouquet 
the formation of wine bouquet is a more complicated process wine bouquet is a result of the winemaking process wine bouquet is produced by the yeast bacteria barrels winemaking procedures etc 
some bouquet components are prevalent soon after the completion of fermentation but these components decrease in intensity with time other bouquet components may require several years 
to develop fully byproducts produced by the yeast contribute to the fresh fruity nose so typical of white table wines such as gewurztraminer riesling and chenin blanc however these odor 
components are short lived they often disappear in less than a year or so consequently these types of wines are best consumed when they are young and the nose is still fresh and fruity 
bouquet components decrease remain constant or increase in intensity as the wine ages byproducts produced by lactic bacteria can give wines a lasting buttery attribute wines stored in oak barrels slowly accumulate vanillin and other 
substances from the wood wine acids react with alcohols to produce volatile esters and during bulk storage oxidation slowly changes many wine ingredients all these different materials contribute to the bouquet of the wine 
after the wine is bottled oxygen is no longer available and a different type of aging begins to take place winemakers call these transformations reduction reactions because 
they take place without oxygen reduction aging is responsible for the changes that produce bottle bouquet this is the bouquet that develops after a wine has been in 
the bottle for some time as a wine ages the aroma gradually decreases and the wine becomes less and less varietal in character wine becomes more vinous as the aroma decreases 
and the bouquet increases when wines are blind tasted wine experts sometimes have trouble distinguishing old zinfandel wines from old cabernet sauvignon wines 
summary 
winemaking can be divided into four major steps first grapes are harvested in optimum condition second the grapes are fermented in the third step the new wine is clarified and stabilized in the 
last step the wine is aged to enhance its sensory qualities each of the four steps contributes to the quality of the finished wine however basic wine quality is determined in the first step 
the potential quality of any wine is established when the grapes are selected and harvested once the fruit is harvested the winemaker attempts to realize the potential quality by carefully guiding 
the wine through the other three winemaking steps making high quality wine from poor quality grapes is impossible but making poor quality wine from high quality grapes is very easy 
the winemaking process may take a few months or it can extend for several years during this time many procedures and operations are performed so winemakers keep accurate records 
of the procedures used to make each wine this record documents the winemaking details starting from several weeks before the grapes were harvested until the wine is bottled

home winemaking costs 
a great deal of expensive equipment is not required to make 50 gallons of wine grape crushers and wine presses can be rented by the day for a few dollars each used barrels can be purchased for less than fifty dollars and the deposit on a 
15 gallon beer keg is about fifteen dollars each year home winemakers ferment large quantities of red wine in new 32 gallon plastic trash cans much of the equipment needed to produce small quantities of wine can be found around the home 
fruit quantity 
wine is measured by the case and a case contains approximately 2 4 gallons of wine estimating just how much wine can be made from 
a ton of grapes is difficult the amount depends upon the grape variety the equipment used and the winemaking methods employed 
professional winemakers often get 160 to 180 gallons of wine per ton of grapes home winemakers working with small basket presses 
are doing well to get 150 gallons of wine per ton of fruit one hundred and fifty gallons represent about 62 cases of wine 
wine grapes are bought and sold by the ton the price of a ton of grapes will depend upon the grape variety the location of the vineyard and upon supply and demand in 1994 napa valley cabernet 
sauvignon grapes sold for about 1200 a ton temecula cabernet sold for around 600 and cabernet grown in the bakersfield area sold for less than 500 a ton representative prices for
several varieties of wine grapes grown in the temecula valley are shown in table 1 when home winemakers purchase fruit in 100

package cost 

table wine is a very perishable food product wine oxidizes quite easily and wine is susceptible to attack by a variety of microorganisms 
if wine is going to be stored for any significant time it must be sealed in air tight containers and stored in a cool dark environment 
the standard package for quality wine consists of a 750 milliliter glass bottle a standard 1 3/4 inch cork a capsule and an appropriate label 
to identify the contents the costs of the fruit and the costs of the package are the major out of pocket expenses for the home winemaker glass 
glass bottles are packed in standard cardboard cartons and the glass is clean and sterile when it leaves the factory glass bottles are heavy so shipping costs are 
high consequently glass is normally shipped in truckload lots and the 
quantities are quite large smaller commercial wineries often pool resources and buy a truckload of bottles to reduce their glass costs this is why the home winemaker 
seldom has access to new glass the average home winemaker really 
has only two alternatives the winemaker must either wash his own or rely on commercially re sterilized used bottles commercial bottle washing enterprises usually charge 
4 00 to 5 00 for a case of re sterilized glass unfortunately 
re sterilized glass is usually hard to find and sometimes it is not available at all ecovin has re sterilized glass available for about 4 00 per case but they are in the 
san francisco bay area and shipping costs can be high corks 
standard wine corks are sold in large sealed polyethylene bags containing one thousand corks the bags are gassed with sulfur 
dioxide and the humidity in the bag is carefully controlled the corks are sterile until the bag is opened dry corks taken 
from a new bag are soft and pliable and they can be driven into a bottle easily unfortunately corks dehydrate quickly and 
become hard after the bag is opened and old dry corks are difficult to drive good quality corks sell for about 135 a bag capsules 
capsules are purely decorative home winemakers generally use push on or heat shrink plastic capsules plastic capsules are shipped by the manufacturer in large cardboard cartons that contain about five thousand capsules labels 
all wine should have a label permanently attached to each bottle to identify the contents custom wine labels are easy to make using a home computer and very attractive labels can be made for a 
few cents each however full color labels printed on heavy weight papers often cost more than twenty five cents each when they are produced in the small numbers needed by most home winemakers 
representative wine cost 
the following example illustrates possible home winemaking costs please note that the costs given here assume the grapes and most of the winemaking supplies 
are purchased in commercial quantities a ton of local wine grapes might cost 600 and produce 62 cases of finished wine here the cost of the fruit 
needed to produce one case of wine would be 9 68 the cost of re sterilized glass might be 5 00 per case and corks might cost 1 50 per case label costs 
can range from less than 0 50 to more than 3 00 per case however pleasing labels can be made on a home computer for less than 0 60 per dozen 
plastic capsules cost from 0 40 to 0 60 per case the cost of miscellaneous winemaking materials like acid sulfite etc will depend upon the characteristics of the wine an average cost of about 0 65 per case is a good estimate

summary 
wine is very perishable and table wine spoils quickly unless it is sealed in air tight containers the standard package for quality wine consists of a 750 ml glass bottle 
a 1 3/4 inch cork a capsule and an appropriate label the cost of homemade wine depends on the cost of the grapes and the cost of the package the cost of the fruit 
and the package are about equal when 600 per ton grapes are used but the package cost is dominant when expensive grapes are used home winemakers can reduce their 
winemaking costs by purchasing grapes by the ton and supplies in commercial quantities washing used wine bottles is another way to reduce home winemaking costs

equipment and facilities 

home made wines are usually produced in five fifteen thirty fifty sixty or 160 gallon quantities some of these quantities may seem a bit strange but containers 
having these specific capacities are readily available wine reacts with oxygen in the air as the size of the container becomes smaller producing high quality 
wine becomes more difficult because of oxidation problems a one gallon container is suitable for bulk storing wine for only a few months five gallon water bottles 
are readily available and they are popular with home winemakers however water bottles are marginal bulk wine containers because of their small size 
small quantities of wine can be made in the kitchen or on a bench in the garage and little special equipment is needed however a larger work space and access to some winemaking equipment will be necessary when fifty gallons 
of wine are made each year when several barrels of wine are produced each season specialized winemaking equipment a large work space and storage space for both bulk wine containers and bottled wine will be needed 
facilities 
winemaking requires two general types of work space and each type has different requirements a crush area is needed to receive and 
process the grapes and a cellar area where the wines are fermented aged and bottled is necessary in addition some general storage 
space is also needed to store winemaking equipment and supplies a separate area set aside for each specific function is the 
ideal arrangement however most winemakers have limited space available for winemaking so compromises are often necessary 
experience shows that careful planning and a few minor modifications can greatly increase the efficiency of any winemaking work space for example a large fraction of the labor in any winery is used to clean and sanitize the equipment and 
the work space sanitation is an ongoing effort in all winemaking areas and cleaning operations are repeated often much time 
and effort can be saved by arranging the work area in a way that optimizes the various cleaning procedures crush area 
crushing and pressing operations at any winery involve handling large quantities of materials grapes must be moved into the crush area and pomace must be removed from the crush 
area consequently most commercial wineries prefer to have their crush operations outside the main facility to simplify handling the large quantities of bulk materials 
many home winemakers use their garages as temporary crush areas each season the crusher is setup near the front of the garage and the grapes are unloaded from trucks or vans parked in the driveway 
washing down the crusher and the press is always necessary before any fruit can be processed then both pieces of equipment must be washed again when the operation has 
been completed a heavy duty hose with an adjustable spray nozzle permanently installed at the crush pad is a great convenience provide a hook or other arrangement 
so the hose can be hung in a convenient place cleaning a small crusher or press will generate large amounts of waste water so water disposal can be a problem most commercial 
crush pads consist of a smooth finished concrete pad that incorporates a large drain home winemakers often use their garages or driveways as crush areas 
pomace should be removed from the crush area promptly even sweet pomace will sour quickly on a hot day and it will attract fruit flies ants can become 
a terrible problem and the entire crush area should be carefully washed to remove all traces of sugar when the crush operations are finished 
cellar space 
white wines are fermented clarified stabilized aged and bottled in the cellar red wine is often fermented in open containers placed 
outside the cellar area cellar activities can generate a significant amount of lees and some way of disposing of liquid 
waste material is needed in the cellar a good solution to the disposal problem is a conveniently located sewer drain a water faucet 
a dedicated hose and a spray nozzle a centrally located floor drain equipped with a large grate is a great convenience 
aging wine is mostly a passive operation and it requires little more space than is necessary to hold the storage containers five gallon water bottles are about 
10 inches in diameter and 20 inches high fifteen gallon stainless steel beer kegs are roughly 15 inches in diameter and 23 inches high 200 liter oak barrels 
are about 24 inches in diameter and 36 inches long a popular 160 gallon polyethylene storage tank manufactured by norwesco is 31 inches in diameter and 55 
inches high double stacking or even triple stacking barrels is possible nevertheless most winemakers find stacked barrels difficult to handle and clean 
bottling wine requires a moderate amount of cellar space a typical bottling setup for an advanced home winemaker or a very small commercial 
winery might consist of a small transfer pump a filter a bottle rinser a bottle filler a corker a labeling rack and a label paster a large 
table or bench would be necessary to hold the empty bottles the bottle rinser the filler and the full bottles in addition a second table 
or a small bench would be needed to hold the label pasting machine and the rack used to hold the bottles while the labels are applied equipment 
large wineries use a great deal of equipment in their winemaking operations but small wineries and home winemakers frequently make due with a minimum of equipment basic crush equipment consists of a crusher 
and a press the key pieces of cellar equipment are wine storage containers pumps filters bottling equipment and test equipment several pieces of common winemaking equipment are briefly discussed below crusher 
a hand crank crusher is probably the most practical method of crushing for the average home winemaker both single and double roller crushers work well however some 
crusher designs are easy to crank and some are not operation of these little crushers is quite simple the crusher is placed on top of a suitable container 
the hopper is filled with fruit and the crank is turned clusters of grapes pass through the rollers and the crushed fruit and stems drop into the container 
having some way of clamping the crusher on the container is very desirable if the crusher slides or moves around it will be more difficult to crank 
stems can be easily removed by hand using the following technique put a clean plastic milk crate on top of a suitable container place a few pounds of crushed fruit in the bottom of the milk crate and make a scrubbing 
motion with the hand the crushed fruit will drop through the crate into the container discard the stems from the crate and repeat the process several hundred pounds of grapes can be destemmed using this method 
a power crusher/stemmer will crush and separate the grapes from the stems in one fast simple operation the grapes are dumped in the fruit hopper and the 
machine does the rest power crushers have capacities ranging from about 1 ton to more than 50 tons of grapes per hour even the smallest machine will 
keep one person busy filling the hopper unfortunately power crushers are expensive the smallest machines cost several hundred dollars crusher/stemmers 
are an overkill for most home winemakers but they can save a tremendous amount of labor if a winemaker produces several barrels of wine each year press 
most home winemakers use a vertical basket press of some kind these presses are made in a wide range of sizes and in several different styles smaller presses can 
handle 10 to 20 pounds and large presses hold several tons of grapes in each load smaller presses use a screw mechanism to generate the pressure large basket 
presses often use hydraulic cylinders and electric pumps to generate the pressure some homemade presses use a hydraulic automobile jack to produce the pressure 
two manufacturers are producing vertical basket presses specifically for home winemakers that use an inflatable rubber bladder to squeeze the grapes 
although small vertical basket presses are relatively inexpensive they can produce high quality juice when used properly the 
major disadvantage of any vertical press is the large amount of labor required to crumble the pomace cake the press must 
be completely disassembled and the basket removed after the cake has been broken up the basket must be reassembled and refilled 
to start a new press cycle several press cycles are usually required to produce dry pomace so much labor is required 
some compound basket presses can produce very high pressures high press pressures can extract the juice with a minimum amount of labor however high 
pressures can also extract excessive amounts of phenolic materials and produce harsh bitter wines so these presses must be used with care 
during the 1950 s many california wineries replaced their vertical hydraulic presses with horizontal presses manufactured by willmes vaslin or other manufacturers horizontal presses 
offer a major advantage because the pomace cake can be crumbled automatically by releasing the pressure and rotating the horizontal basket horizontal presses are simple and 
easy to operate and they save wineries a tremendous amount of labor the vaslin presses were made with fiberglass baskets and covers so they were much less expensive to produce 
than presses constructed of stainless steel although horizontal screw presses are no longer manufactured many small wineries continue to use one two and six ton vaslin presses 
modern commercial wine presses are controlled by computers and they can be programmed to execute very complicated press schedules automatically modern presses use an inflatable bag tube or membrane after the press is loaded 
the membrane is inflated and gently squeezes the grapes against the basket to extract the juice these new presses are nearly self operating and they only require attention when the 
press is being loaded or unloaded bottle filler 
filling wine bottles with a piece of hose is easy the hose is inserted into the wine container and the wine is siphoned into the bottles however reducing wine oxidation is always desirable so wine bottles should 
always be filled from the bottom with a minimum of splashing and bubbling wand type bottle fillers are a great improvement over a piece of hose a simple wand filler consists of a 16 inch length of rigid plastic 
tubing fitted with a small plastic valve at the bottom end attached to the end of a siphon tube when the wand is inserted in the empty bottle the valve presses against the bottom of the bottle and the wine 
starts to flow wine flow automatically stops when the operator raises the tube small diameter fillers often generate excessive amounts of foam so inch diameter wand type fillers are generally preferred 
several styles of gravity type bottle fillers are available these fillers have a small tank to hold the wine and two or more siphon tubes to transfer the wine into the bottles a float valve mechanism is used to keep 
the tank full operation of small multi spout gravity type fillers is simple an empty wine bottle is placed on a spout the machine fills the bottle to a preset level and automatically stops two three four and 
six spout machines are common but gravity bottle fillers as large as 24 spouts are produced two three and four spout fillers are suitable for home winemakers producing 50 or more gallons of wine each year large 
gravity fillers are used by smaller commercial wineries many gravity type fillers will fill at a rate of about two bottles per spout per minute one person is kept quite busy removing and replacing bottles 
larger wineries use automatic vacuum type bottle fillers these large multiple spout fillers are often integrated into a complete high speed bottling line empty bottles are sparged with nitrogen gas filled with 
wine corked under a vacuum and capsules and labels are applied completely packaged wine comes off the bottling line and much of the work is done automatically older bottling lines often run at rates of 10 
to 40 bottles per minute and older equipment requires the constant attention of several winery employees modern bottling equipment runs at rates of 30 to 200 bottles per minute and these high speed lines only 
require one or two people for efficient operation modern high speed bottling equipment has reduced winery labor costs significantly however these machines are extremely 
complicated and very expensive transfer pump 
pumps are used in wineries to move must lees juice and wine wine contains significant amounts of acid so any pump used for wine must be made of corrosion resistant materials 
a variety of pump styles are produced to meet the requirements of different winery applications transfer pumps are used to transfer juice or wine for filtering 
and for bottling most transfer pumps are either rubber impeller jabsco style pumps or centrifugal pumps rubber impeller pumps are generally preferred for moderate flow 
rate applications when the pressure heads are higher centrifugal pumps are generally preferred when large flow rates against moderate pressure heads are needed 
home winemakers use a variety of small pumps capacities range from three to ten gallons per minute a typical rubber impeller pump can deliver five 
gallons per minute and it has a maximum pressure head of 30 pounds per square inch many of these little rubber impeller pumps are self priming 
inexpensive and provide good performance they should not be run dry for extended periods and their shaft seals have a limited service life a leaky 
pump with a worn shaft seal will quickly oxidize the wine so shaft seals on small pumps must be replaced often these pumps sell for about 100 
small magnetically coupled centrifugal pumps are quite suitable for general use in any small winery a magnetically coupled centrifugal pump does not have a shaft seal 
because the impeller shaft does not penetrate the pump housing the impeller is coupled to the drive motor by means of two powerful permanent magnets magnetically 
coupled pumps have advantages and disadvantages they are more expensive than direct coupled pumps they are not self priming and sometimes getting these pumps started 
is difficult on the other hand magnetically coupled pumps have long trouble free lives and they do not have shaft seals to leak air and oxidize the wine corker 
hand corking machines are made in a variety of styles and prices range from a couple of dollars to several hundred dollars an effective corking machine must 
be able to do two functions and these two functions must be separately the cork must be compressed first and then the cork must be driven into the bottle 
a good hand corker can drive dry corks without excessive effort well designed floor model corkers sell for about 100 1995 the better machines are solidly 
built and have a useful life greater than 100 000 corks some small inexpensive corking machines sold at home winemaking shops are practically worthless storage containers 
cooperage is the general term used for all kinds of bulk wine storage containers open containers with straight sides are called vats closed wine storage vessels with straight sides are called tanks curved sided containers 
with a bulge in the center like the familiar barrel are called casks casks range in size from 100 to more than 1000 gallons depending upon size and proportions casks are called butts pipes puncheons ovals etc 
the traditional wood used to make wine containers is white oak however in california redwood was extensively used for constructing wine containers from about 
1840 to 1950 very large wine tanks have been fabricated from reinforced concrete and concrete storage containers were widely used in wineries from the 
early 1900 s until about 1950 a large bank of concrete tanks could still be seen at the old galleano winery in mira loma ca in 1997 in recent years stainless 
steel has become the material of choice for wine tanks and several manufacturers are now producing smaller size tanks from high density polyethylene open fermenters 
some small commercial wineries and most home winemakers use open containers for fermenting red wine large amounts of carbon 
dioxide gas are generated during fermentation and the wine becomes saturated with carbon dioxide the constant evolution 
of gas prevents air from entering the wine so oxidation is not a problem when fermentation is complete carbon dioxide gas is no longer produced and the wine must then be stored in sealed 
containers to protect it from oxygen in the air 
open fermenters range in size from 5 to 5000 gallons small wineries seldom use open fermenters larger than a few hundred gallons because it is very difficult to punch down the 
cap in a large vat by hand stainless steel wood and polyethylene are the most suitable construction materials for red fermenters small wineries often use polyethylene half 
ton fruit bins as temporary red fermenters each crush season a 55 gallon polyethylene drum makes a good open fermenter when the top is removed thirty gallon food grade polyethylene 
containers with tight fitting lids are available at most home winemaking shops much homemade red wine is fermented in 32 gallon plastic trash cans each year closed containers 
white and blush wines are always fermented in closed containers and most commercial wineries ferment their red wines in closed tanks when closed 
containers are used the large volumes of carbon dioxide gas produced during fermentation must be vented so winemakers seal closed tanks 
with fermentation locks until all signs of fermentation have stopped fermentation locks come in several sizes and styles most small fermentation 
locks contain a liquid trap of some sort the trap lets the carbon dioxide gas escape while preventing air from entering the tank 
five gallon water bottles are readily available and they are popular wine storage containers water bottles are the containers most often used by beginning home winemakers they have both advantages 
and disadvantages glass is a smooth vitreous material it can be cleaned easily and glass can be completely sterilized glass is transparent so fermentation progress is easy to monitor visually 
five gallon water bottles are generally too small for serious winemaking because of the oxidation problem however a few water bottles 
are handy for storing leftovers glass containers are heavy and some winemakers find it difficult to move a full carboy 
glass is both slick and fragile handling heavy glass bottles with wet hands can be quite dangerous another negative factor 
is the high cost of glass in 1997 the price of a new glass water bottle was about 15 00 that amounts to 3 00 per gallon 
polyethylene has become a recognized food grade material and polyethylene drums are widely used for shipping liquid food products wine can be safely stored for extended periods in heavy walled 
containers made of dense polyethylene and several firms are now producing polyethylene tanks in a variety of standard sizes and shapes specifically for use as wine storage containers 
used poly drums are available in 20 30 40 and 55 gallon sizes and they make excellent wine storage containers wine storage containers made of dense polyethylene 
have advantages and disadvantages they are light weight so polyethylene drums can be handled and stored easily best of all they are inexpensive 
new poly drums sell for about 1 00 per gallon and good used drums are often available for a few dollars each however polyethylene has a porous micro structure and it is a difficult material to clean completely 
used polyethylene drums can retain odors for extremely long times some odors can contaminate wine so secondhand drums must 
be selected with care this odor problem is the major disadvantage of using used polyethylene containers for storing wine 
most winemakers agree that stainless steel is the best material for fabricating large wine storage tanks a polished food grade surface made of stainless steel is 
easy to clean and sterilize properly designed stainless tanks are inert and they are completely tight unfortunately stainless steel is an expensive material 
the cost of a large size tank 10 000 gallons is two or three dollars a gallon smaller size tanks 500 gallons cost several dollars 
a gallon nevertheless stainless steel tanks give many years of trouble free service and when properly maintained they last almost 
indefinitely home winemakers often use surplus stainless beer kegs for wine storage containers the deposit for a 15 gallon beer keg 
is about 15 fifteen dollars is a dollar per gallon of storage capacity and finding a less expensive wine container is difficult barrels 
oak barrels have been used for storing wine for hundreds of years standard wine barrels come in two sizes 200 liters 52 gals and 225 liters 59 gals oak wood imparts a spicy vanillin flavor that is desirable 
in most red wines and this oak character is obtained by storing wine in oak barrels for an extended time after a barrel is four or five years old it no longer produces the desirable flavors 
and wineries must replace their barrels from time to time a few wineries replace all of their barrels each year but most wineries replace 20 to 30 percent of their barrels each year in 1997 new french 
barrels cost about 600 each and american barrels cost about 200 obviously the annual barrel replacement is a considerable expense when wineries use many barrels in their wine aging program 
besides their high cost oak barrels have several other disadvantages barrels are heavy difficult to handle and hard to clean an empty barrel weighs almost 100 pounds and a barrel full of 
wine weighs about 600 pounds with a little practice empty barrels can be moved by hand without much difficulty however this is not so with a full barrel and moving a barrel full of 
wine more than a short distance by hand is seldom feasible wineries place full barrels on pallets and then the pallets are moved with a fork lift oak barrels are prone to attack by wood 
borers unless the wood is treated with a special preservative barrels are difficult to stack by hand even when specially built racks are used eventually any oak barrel will leak 
oak chips can be added to wine to impart desirable oak flavors and many wineries use oak chips to flavor their lesser quality wines because of the high cost of new barrels 
some winemakers put the oak chips in a nylon mesh bag and 
then suspend the bag in the wine other winemakers just add the chips directly to the wine after a few days the loose chips sink to the bottom of the container and then the chips

are treated just like lees estimating the quantity 
of chips to be added is difficult for the inexperienced winemaker the amount needed will depend upon the specific wine and on personal preference ten or twelve ounces of chips for 50 gallons of red wine is a reasonable place to 
start considerably fewer chips are appropriate for most white wines all wines should be tasted periodically after oak chips are added then the wine can be racked off the chips when the winemaker feels the taste is satisfactory 
barrels full of wine require little extra attention but used empty barrels are difficult to maintain when a barrel is first filled almost four gallons of wine 
soaks into the wood when a used barrel is left empty for a few days the wine in the wood starts turning into vinegar sterilizing oak barrels is practically 
impossible so when barrels become infected with vinegar bacteria they must be discarded commercial winemakers avoid this problem by not emptying their 
barrels until new wine is available then as the barrels are emptied they are washed with clean water and immediately refilled with new wine 
home winemakers should avoid very small oak barrels small oak barrels or casks are difficult to build and they are very expensive per gallon of capacity they are prone to 
leakage and small wood cooperage is more difficult to maintain 
properly wine stored in small oak containers becomes over oaked very quickly oak casks of five or ten gallon capacity are often recommended by home winemaking shops 
but these tiny barrels are little more than expensive toys summary 
every winery needs a crush area for processing grapes and a cellar area for fermenting aging and bottling wine a third area is needed where equipment and supplies can be stored at many home 
 wineries a concrete driveway serves as the crush area and the garage is the cellar and storage space however daytime temperatures in typical garages are often excessive for wine storage 
little special equipment is needed to make a few gallons of wine however well designed winemaking equipment can reduce the amount of physical labor needed when larger quantities of wine 
are made basic crush equipment consists of a 
crusher and a press and basic cellar equipment includes cooperage pumps hoses filters bottling equipment and test equipment many home winemakers use new 32 gallon plastic trash cans for open red fermenters and surplus stainless 
steel beer kegs for wine storage containers new oak barrels can impart desirable vanillin flavor characteristics to red wines on the other hand barrels are difficult to handle in a small winery and some leakage is always encountered 
new oak barrels are expensive and the oak flavor disappears after the barrels have been used for a few years oak chips can be used to impart desirable oak flavors in wine and chips are inexpensive and easy to use

materials 
various materials are added to wine throughout the winemaking process these materials are used to solve specific wine problems for example bentonite is always added to white and blush wines the bentonite removes 
excess protein and prevents protein from forming a haze after the wine is bottled small amounts of sulfur dioxide are added when the grapes are crushed and small additions of sulfur dioxide continue until 
the wine is bottled sulfur dioxide helps control the growth of microorganisms and it reduces the effects of oxidation wines fermented from apples and stone fruits often contain excessive amounts of pectin the 
pectin makes the wine difficult to clarify so winemakers add enzymes to break down the pectin the most common wine additives are sulfur dioxide fining agents stabilizing materials and wine preservatives 
common winemaking materials 
winemakers must use care when selecting wine additives wine is a food and any substance added during the winemaking process 
must be a food grade material most materials used in winemaking are also used throughout the food and beverage industries 
these materials are widely used and available to the winemaker as normal commercial products a few wine additives are unique to the winemaking industry and sources of a few materials may be difficult for home winemakers to find 
many winemaking materials are supplied by the manufacturer in dry granular forms these materials are usually shipped in heavy paper or plastic bags containing about 50 pounds of material with a few 
exceptions winemaking materials have a long shelf life many winemaking materials can be kept for several years when placed in tightly sealed containers and stored at reasonable temperatures 
home winemakers can reduce their winemaking costs by getting together and purchasing frequently used winemaking materials in 
commercial quantities materials purchased in small quantities often cost three or four times the bulk price so the savings 
can be significant reagents for wine testing and yeast and sulfites are exceptions and fresh supplies of these materials 
should be purchased each season the characteristics of several common winemaking materials are briefly discussed below 
anti foam 
anti foam is a clear oily liquid this is a silicone product and it has no smell or taste anti foam is used to prevent foam from 
overflowing containers during active fermentation about 250 milliliters of anti foam added to a 1000 gallon wine tank will 
reduce foaming to a minimum this material is completely inert and does not react with the wine in any way most of the anti foam 
added will disappear when the wine is racked even if a few drops remain they will be removed when the wine is filtered 
ascorbic acid 
ascorbic acid is vitamin c winemakers add ascorbic acid when wines contain di sulfides in larger amounts di sulfides can smell like a skunk smaller quantities give wine a rubber or garlic smell when very small quantities are present 
di sulfides can give wine a vague dirty odor at even lower levels di sulfides often do not produce a specific odor sometimes they are not detectable but minute quantities of di sulfides can kill the normal bouquet of a fine wine 
when ascorbic acid is added to wine it reacts with the di sulfides and the di sulfides are converted into a material called mercaptan when all of the di sulfides are converted into mercaptan the winemaker adds a very small quantity 
0 05 to 0 5 milligrams per liter of copper sulfate the copper sulfate removes the mercaptan from the wine this treatment is only effective when the ascorbic acid is added to the wine several days before the copper sulfate addition 
many australian winemakers use ascorbic acid as an anti oxidant when bottling wine the ascorbic acid is used in combination with sulfur dioxide 
calcium carbonate 
sometimes grapes grown in cold climates contain too much acid then winemakers often use calcium carbonates to reduce the acid content 
of juice before fermentation this material is occasionally used to reduce the acid content of finished wines by small amounts 
however when carbonates are used to reduce the acidity of a finished wine they can change wine flavors raise ph and cause other 
problems grapes grown in warm climates are usually low in acid so carbonates are seldom used with warm climate fruit 
citric acid 
citric acid is one of the work horse materials in the winery and it is used for several different purposes citric acid is mixed with sulfite 
powder and water to prepare sulfur dioxide solutions sulfur dioxide solutions are used to sterilize winery pumps hoses filters and other 
winery equipment sulfur dioxide solutions are also used for wet barrel storage winemakers use weak 1 percent citric acid solutions to 
remove the paper taste from new filter pads stronger solutions 5 percent of citric acid are often used to sanitize bottling equipment 
sometimes citric acid is added to finished wines specifically to increase acidity and improve acid balance in small quantities it provides a fresh citric characteristic 
and the citric quality is often appreciated in white table wines 
nevertheless bench trials should always be done before making any large additions of citric acid significant additions of citric acid are seldom made to red wines the citric taste does not seem appropriate in most red wines 
about half a gram of citric acid per gallon is often added to commercial wines to improve long term stability 
diammonium phosphate dap 
diammonium phosphate is a major ingredient in many proprietary yeast foods it is added to juice or must before fermentation to supply extra nitrogen the additional nitrogen encourages rapid yeast growth and more dependable 
fermentations california chardonnay grapes are often deficient in nitrogen and many winemakers add dap to all chardonnay juices to help the yeast complete fermentation and not leave residual sugar in the wine 
juices lacking nitrogen can cause another problem some yeasts produce excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide when a juice 
lacks sufficient available nitrogen here winemakers add dap to provide extra nitrogen to reduce hydrogen sulfide formation 
fumaric acid 
in the past winemakers often added small quantities of fumaric acid to their red wines the acid prevented malolactic fermentation from occurring after the wine was bottled 
however since sterile filtration equipment became widely available fumaric acid is seldom used commercially many home winemakers lack filtration equipment so home 
winemakers continue to use fumaric acid to control ml fermentation the customary dose levels range from one to three grams of acid per gallon of wine bench testing should 
always be done before fumaric acid is added to wine this acid can improve the taste of some red wine but sometimes fumaric acid produces unusual or off flavors 
malic acid 
vines release malic acid by respiration throughout the ripening season when grapes are grown in hot regions little malic acid remains by harvest time and sometimes winemakers add malic acid 
to white wines to improve the ratio of malic and tartaric acid small additions of malic acid raise the total acidity and often give white table wines a pleasing apple like freshness 
pantothenic acid 
yeasts often produce excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide when grapes are deficient in pantothenic acid 
consequently some winemakers add very small quantities of this material to juice or crushed grapes before starting fermentation pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased in any drug store 
pectinase pectic enzyme 
sometimes commercial wineries use enzymes to increase the amount of free run juice when crushing white grapes the enzymes break down the cells in the grape pulp and 
the juice is released the additional free run juice reduces the number of press loads so pressing is quicker after an enzyme treatment home winemakers using small 
basket presses use pectic enzymes to make white grapes easier to process pectic enzymes are also used to prevent pectin hazes from forming in wines made from fruit 
or from grape concentrate excessive quantities of enzymes can produce off odors and bad tastes the manufacturers directions should be followed carefully 
potassium bitartrate 
sometimes small quantities of potassium bitartrate cream of tarter are added to young wines during the cold stabilization treatment the potassium bitartrate crystals speed the precipitation of excess 
tartrate material from the wine the time required to stabilize the wine is shortened and winery refrigeration costs are reduced one to four pounds per 1000 gallons of wine is the normal dose 
potassium carbonate 
potassium carbonate is often used to deacidify juice and wine instead of calcium carbonate however when this material is added to wine the potassium 
 content can be increased significantly the additional potassium can cause increases in wine ph so potassium carbonate must be used carefully 
besides increasing ph a stability problem sometimes occurs because the potassium reacts with tartaric acid in the wine potassium bitartrate is formed and unless this material 
is removed it can precipitate out of the wine after bottling because of this instability problem potassium carbonates should not be used after wine has been cold stabilized 
potassium caseinate 
potassium caseinate is a common wine fining material this material is used to reduce the tannin content in red wine and it is used for white wine clarification potassium caseinate 
is also used to remove odors and brown colors from oxidized white and blush wines sometimes this material is effective for removing excessive oak character from white wines 
when added to wine potassium caseinate reacts with wine acids and coagulates quickly fining is more successful when a caseinate water solution is injected into the wine under pressure 
then a very fine suspension is formed and better mixing is achieved some home winemakers mix the dry powder in water and use a large syringe to inject the solution into the wine 
potassium caseinate can strip desirable wine flavors and it can give wine a cheesy taste when excessive quantities are used normal dose levels range from 1/10 to 1/4 gram per gallon and bench trials should always be done 
potassium metabisulfite sulfite 
home winemakers use potassium metabisulfite crystals to introduce sulfur dioxide into their wines small quantities of sulfur dioxide are used to control wine microbes and sulfur dioxide also 
reduces wine oxidation when sulfite is added to wine it produces about half its weight in so2 about one gram of sulfur dioxide is produced when two grams of sulfite are added to the wine 
strong sulfite solutions are used to sterilize just about everything in a winery one teaspoon of sulfite powder and two teaspoons of citric 
acid in two gallons of water makes an effective solution for sterilizing equipment and some home winemakers use this solution 
to sterilize bottles just before they are filled with wine inert oak barrels can be stored full of water safely using a sulfite 
solution one cup of citric acid and one cup of sulfite crystals are added and then the barrel is filled with clean water 
potassium sorbate sorbate 
home winemakers use potassium sorbate to stabilize wines containing residual sugar the sorbate does not stop the yeast from fermenting the 
sugar but it can prevent the yeast cells from reproducing consequently sorbate is only effective when most of the active yeast cells 
have been removed from the wine by racking or filtering the usual procedure for using potassium sorbate is to clarify stabilize and age 
the wine then the wine is sweetened and the sorbate is added at bottling time potassium sorbate will not stop active fermentations 
for most people the taste threshold of sorbate is 200 or 300 milligrams per liter of wine however some people are more sensitive to the taste of sorbate and a small fraction 
of the population can detect less than 50 milligrams per liter fortunately for the winemaker many people sensitive to sorbate do not find its taste objectionable in wine 
the normal dose level is 200 to 250 milligrams of potassium sorbate for each liter of wine about one gram of sorbate per gallon of wine if too little sorbate is added the wine will probably 
start to ferment if too much sorbate is added the quality of the wine may be adversely affected dose levels of more than 250 mg/l can produce noticeable changes in wine taste and odor 
sodium bisulfite 
sodium bisulfite is an inexpensive source of sulfur dioxide for small wineries it provides the same amount of so2 as potassium metabisulfite but the sodium compound is less expensive sodium bisulfite 
is mixed with water and used for sterilizing winemaking equipment and for wet barrel storage since it adds sodium this material is usually not used as a source of sulfur dioxide in wine 
both potassium metabisulfite and sodium bisulfite are very sensitive to water and both compounds should always be stored in tightly sealed containers even when stored in sealed containers these 
materials can degrade rapidly and much wine has been spoiled by home winemakers using spent sulfite powder old sulfite powder should be discarded and a new supply purchased each season 
soda ash 
soda ash sodium carbonate is one of the primary cleaning agents in the winery it is used to clean and sanitize equipment tanks 
pumps hoses and even barrels soda ash in water produces a strong caustic solution and a soda ash solution is particularly 
useful for removing heavy tartrate deposits from the surfaces of wine storage containers all soda ash solutions must be carefully rinsed to remove the residue home winemakers often use soda ash to soak labels off old wine bottles 
tartaric acid 
winemakers add tartaric acid to juice or must to raise acidity and lower ph large acid adjustments should
be made before fermentation is started an addition of four grams of tartaric acid per gallon of juice will raise the ta about 0 1 percent calculated acid 
additions are seldom accurate and calculated acid values should not be relied upon a small sample should be tested before making large acid additions 
care must be taken when tartaric acid is added to wine late in the winemaking process if much tartaric acid is added the wine may need to be cold stabilized again otherwise tartrate crystals may form in the bottled wine 
thiamine 
thiamine is vitamin b 1 and it is essential for healthy yeast growth winemakers often add thiamine and other vitamins to juice before starting fermentation 
trisodium phosphate tsp 
trisodium phosphate is a popular cleaning material for all types of winery surfaces this material is inexpensive effective and it washes away easily a chlorinated form of trisodium phosphate is also available 
and the chlorinated form is a potent sterilizing material in many commercial wineries chlorinated tsp is the material of choice for decontaminating large stainless steel wine storage tanks 
viniflora oenos 
viniflora oenos is a freeze dried culture of malolactic bacteria most ml bacteria are supplied in liquid form and several days are needed to prepare 
a starter viniflora oenos has gained popularity rapidly because it can be added directly to the wine in dry form to start malolactic fermentation 
yeast extract 
yeast extract is added to juice to prevent stuck fermentations by stimulating healthy yeast growth yeast extract provides additional vitamins amino 
acids etc it is more effective when added before fermentation is started yeast extract is a major ingredient in many proprietary yeast supplements 
summary 
winemakers add different materials to wine throughout the winemaking process these additions are made deliberately to improve color clarity stability or general wine quality each fining material can affect wine characteristics 
differently often one characteristic is improved at the expense of another so fining wine is usually a compromise of some kind considerable winemaking experience is needed before wine fining materials can be used effectively 
the types of material and the quantities to be used are usually determined by testing a small batch of wine and observing the results when the desired results are obtained appropriate additions are made to the main lot 
winemaking materials should be kept in tightly sealed containers and then the containers should be stored in a cool dry place with a few exceptions like yeast 
and sulfite most winemaking materials can be kept for several seasons and purchasing winemaking materials in bulk quantities results in significant savings 
chapter 5 

sugars and acids 
sugar molecules are formed from carbon hydrogen and oxygen and the natural grape sugars are the materials yeast converts into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide although sugars are made from only three elements some 
sugar molecules are very large and have complicated structures several different kinds of sugars exist and each sugar has its own name the name used to denote the entire family of sugar molecules is saccharide 
saccharide 
under certain conditions sugar molecules have a great attraction for each other and two small sugar molecules combine and form a larger molecule sometimes many small sugar molecules combine 
and form large complex saccharide molecules because of this attraction characteristic saccharide molecules are classified according to the number of small sugar molecules bound together 
the small simple sugar molecules are called monosaccharides and two simple sugar molecules bound together are called disaccharides three or more sugar molecules bound together into a single 
molecule is called a polysaccharide large polysaccharide molecules consist of thousands of small monosaccharide molecules pectin and gums are examples of large polysaccharide molecules 
monosaccharides 
the monosaccharides are called simple sugars and many different kinds of simple sugars exist each simple sugar molecule contains three four five 
or six carbon atoms the simple sugars are named according to the number of carbon atoms in the simple sugar molecule for example pentose 
sugars contain five carbon atoms and hexose sugars contain six carbon atoms winemakers are primarily interested in the two major grape sugars 
glucose and fructose and both are hexose monosaccharides enzymes produced by yeast convert both glucose and fructose into ethyl alcohol 
glucose is the most common simple sugar and glucose is a part of many different disaccharides and polysaccharides this is the sugar that provides energy for the human body glucose can be produced 
by splitting hydrolysis certain polysaccharides for example corn starch is a large polysaccharide molecule and glucose is produced commercially by hydrolyzing spitting corn starch 
fructose is found in many different kinds of fruit it is the principal sugar in honey and fructose is the sweetest tasting common sugar because it tastes sweeter than 
ordinary table sugar sucrose fructose is widely used and it is the sweetener of choice in the food and beverage industries fructose is sometimes called levulose 
disaccharides 
disaccharides are formed when two simple sugar molecules bind together sometimes two similar kinds of simple sugars combine often two different kinds of sugar molecules combine to form a disaccharide 
disaccharides are produced commercially by the incomplete hydrolysis of larger polysaccharides an alternate process combines two monosaccharide sugars by means of a condensation 
reaction to form disaccharide sugars usually disaccharide sugars must be hydrolyzed and split into their simple sugar components before they can be fermented 
maltose is a common disaccharide and it is made up of two glucose sugar molecules maltose can be produced in several different ways very large quantities of maltose are produced 
each year from germinated grain and then the maltose is fermented to make beer maltose is also produced by the incomplete hydrolysis of starch glycogen or dextrin 
sucrose ordinary white table sugar is found in many fruits and vegetables and it also occurs in a variety of grasses including sugar cane sucrose is a disaccharide made up of one glucose 
sugar and one fructose sugar this sugar is produced commercially in great quantities from both sugar cane and sugar beets sugar stored in the roots of grape vines is in the sucrose form 
microorganisms including wine yeasts produce enzymes that can hydrolyze sucrose and when sucrose hydrolyzes each sucrose molecule splits into one glucose and one fructose molecule this process 
produces a 50 50 mixture of glucose and fructose monosaccharides called invert sugar sucrose is a non reducing sugar and it cannot be accurately measured with clinitest tablets 
lactose milk sugar is only found in milk from mammals it is a disaccharide made up of one glucose sugar and one galactose sugar molecule lactose is easily 
hydrolyzed and it is the basis of many dairy products including cheese lactose is an interesting sugar because it has practically no sweet taste 
polysaccharides 
polysaccharides are large complex carbohydrate molecules containing three or more monosaccharides living organisms use polysaccharides to store 
energy and polysaccharides also form part of cell structural fibers starch consists of many glucose monosaccharides hooked together 
in both linear and branched forms pectin gums and cellulose are also large polysaccharide molecules pectin and gums are of particular interest 
to winemakers because wines containing small quantities of these polysaccharide materials are sometimes very difficult to clarify 
wines made from grapes infected with botrytis mold and wines made from cooked fruit often contain excessive quantities of pectin these wines are often difficult to clarify because the pectin holds 
spent yeast cells in suspension and the wine clears very slowly grape concentrate is made by heating grape juice and wines made from concentrate are sometimes difficult to clarify pectin 
rapidly clogs filter pads so filtration may not be a practical way of clarifying wines containing large quantities of pectin or gums however pectic enzymes can be effective in clarifying 
wines containing excessive amounts of pectin the enzymes break the pectin down into smaller more easily managed polysaccharide molecules then the wine becomes clear in a reasonable time 
wine acids 
practically all of the acids in sound wine come directly from the grapes however very small quantities of several organic acids 
are produced during primary fermentation and under adverse conditions bacteria in wine can produce enough acetic acid 
to spoil good wine in a short time in the united states titratable acid in wine is expressed in grams of acid per 100 milliliters of wine and titratable acid is calculated as if all of the different acids in the wine were tartaric acid 
the acid content of most finished table wine ranges from 0 55 to 0 85 percent the desirable acid content depends on style and how much residual sugar is 
left in the wine ideally the acid content of grapes should fall in the range from 0 65 to 0 85 grams per 100 milliliters percent however grapes grown 
in cool climates often contain too much acid and fruit grown in warm climates generally contains to little acid one of the more important winemaking tasks 
consists of adjusting the starting acid content of the grapes before fermentation the goal is to have just enough acid to produce a balanced wine 
practically all of the acids found in sound wines are fixed acids most of the fixed acids originate in the grape juice and these 
acids remain during fermentation and appear in the finished wine fixed acids are nonvolatile and nearly odorless however 
bacteria can produce acetic acid in wine and acetic acid is different from other wine acids acetic acid is considered a volatile 
acid because it evaporates easily acetic acid has a distinctive odor and it gives wine an unpleasant hot aftertaste 
acids produce hydrogen ions 
in water some acid molecules ionize and some acid molecules remain unchanged each ionized acid molecule splits into two separate pieces 
one piece is a hydrogen atom minus the electron and the other piece is the remainder of the acid molecule both pieces have 
an electric charge and both are called ions a positive electric charge is carried by the hydrogen ion and a negative charge is 
carried by the acid ion the remainder of the acid molecules the unionized molecules remains unchanged in the water solution 
both tartaric and malic acids have two hydrogens that can ionize and these two hydrogens h are shown in figure 2 
acid strength 
acids produce hydrogen ions in water solutions however the number of hydrogen ions produced can be large or small the number of hydrogen ions depends on how much acid is present in the solution and the number also

h 	 o h h h 
tartaric acid malic acid 
figure 2 when wine acids ionize one or both of the hydrogens shown in bold type separate from the main acid structure 
depends on the strength of the acid 
in water some acid molecules spontaneously split into positive and negative ions however many acid molecules remain unchanged the fraction of acid molecules that ionize depends upon the strength of the acid when practically 
all of the acid molecules ionize the acid is called a strong acid when only a few acid molecules ionize the acid is called a weak acid in other words strong acids ionize completely and weak acids only partially ionize 
only a few acids are classified as strong all of the organic acids found in wine are weak acids however some weak acids are stronger than others tartaric acid is a weak acid and about one out of every 900 tartaric acid 
molecules ionizes in water the other 899 molecules remain unchanged malic acid is weaker than tartaric acid only one out of every 2500 malic acid molecules ionizes in water the other 2499 malic acid molecules 
remain unchanged tartaric acid is about 2 7 times stronger than malic acid because tartaric acid produces 2 7 times more hydrogen ions than an equal quantity of malic acid smaller quantities of a stronger acid can 
produce as many hydrogen ions as larger quantities of a weaker acid tartaric acid is considered the principal wine acid it is the strongest of the wine acids and generally more tartaric acid is present in wine 
wine can be thought of as a simple water alcohol solution and acids in wine behave much the same as they 
do in any other water solution the number of hydrogen ions 
in a wine depends upon the quantity of acid the strength of 
the acids and the quantities of potassium sodium and calcium 
present in the wine acid quantity 
type grams/liter 
kinds of acids 
tartaric 1 to 5 
the tart taste of dry table wine is produced by the total malic 1 to 4 
quantity and the kinds of acids present tartaric and malic are succinic 0 4 to 1 
the major wine acids these two acids are present when the lactic 0 1 to 0 4 
grapes are picked and they are carried over through the citric 0 04 to 0 7 
fermentation process into the finished wine wine also acetic 0 05 to 0 5 
contains small quantities of lactic citric succinic acetic and table 3 some common wine acids 
several other organic acids as shown in table 3 some of 
these acids do not exist in the grapes they are produced in 
small quantities by microorganisms throughout the winemaking process 

malic acid and citric acid can be metabolized easily by microorganisms in the wine tartaric acid and succinic acid are more stable biologically and they are seldom bothered by wine microbes even so under 
certain conditions tartaric acid can be attacked by microorganisms and when this occurs the wine is 
usually a catastrophic loss see chapter 13 
tartaric acid 
few fruits other than grapes contain significant amounts of tartaric acid one half to two thirds of the acid
content of ripe grapes is tartaric acid and it is the strongest of the grape acids tartaric acid is responsible for much of the tart taste of wine and it contributes to both the biological stability and the 
longevity of wine 
the amount of tartaric acid in grapes remains practically constant throughout the ripening period however the situation in wine is different the quantity of tartaric acid slowly decreases in wine by small 
amounts both potassium and calcium combine readily with tartaric acid and form potassium bitartrate and calcium tartrate compounds then crystals of these two materials precipitate out of the wine during 
fermentation these tartrate materials can continue to precipitate for a long time and aged wine usually contains about two thirds as much tartaric acid as the starting grapes because of tartrate precipitation 
unfortunately these acid salts of potassium and calcium precipitate very slowly at normal cellar temperatures and wine can contain excessive quantities of these materials even after many months of aging 
wineries use special wine treatments to speed up tartrate precipitation cooling the wine is the most commonly used procedure just cooling the wine to about 27 degrees causes excess potassium salts to 
precipitate out in a few days 
tartaric acid is resistant to decomposition and it is seldom attacked by wine microbes this is why winemakers add tartaric acid to grapes deficient in acidity 
rather than using a less stable acid such as malic or citric most winemakers prefer the titratable acid to be about 0 7 percent for white grapes and about 
0 8 percent is preferred for white juice when the titratable acid content falls below these levels winemakers often add tartaric acid to the grapes or juice before they start fermentation 
malic acid 
malic acid is prevalent in many types of fruit this acid is responsible for the tart taste of green apples malic acid is one of the biologically fragile wine acids and it is easily metabolized by several 
different types of wine bacteria unlike tartaric acid the malic acid content of grapes decreases throughout the ripening process and grapes are grown in hot climates contain little malic acid by harvest time 
grapes grown in cool regions often contain too much acid high acidity results in excessively tart wines so the winemaker has a problem during alcoholic fermentation some malic acid is metabolized and the 
malic acid content of the wine decreases about 15 percent malolactic fermentation ml can further reduce wine acidity when wine goes through malolactic fermentation bacteria convert the malic acid into lactic 
acid lactic acid is milder than malic acid and ml fermentation is a standard procedure used to reduce the acidity of wines made from grapes grown in cool regions 
when grapes are grown in warm areas like southern california the winemaking situation is much different in warm regions the grapes are usually deficient in acid and removing malic acid by means of ml 
fermentation may not be a good idea now the problem becomes more complicated for the winemaker malic acid is not biologically stable and when malic acid is deliberately retained to improve the acid 
balance of 
the wine special steps may be needed to prevent ml fermentation from occurring after the wine is bottled the winemaker can use a sterile filter and remove all of the bacteria from the wine before 
bottling or 
he can add small quantities of fumaric acid to the wine small additions of fumaric acid can inhibit ml fermentation and make the wine stabile 
citric acid 
only small amounts of citric acid are present in grapes only about 5 percent of the total acid is citric in sound grapes like malic acid citric acid is easily converted into other materials by wine 
microorganisms for example citric acid can be fermented into lactic acid and some types of lactic bacteria can ferment citric acid into acetic acid excessive amounts of acetic acid are never desirable 
in wine 
so the citric acid into acetic acid fermentation can be a serious problem this potential difficulty is why citric acid is seldom used to acidify must or juice before fermentation most winemakers 
consider the 
risk of producing excessive quantities of acetic acid too great 
the acetic acid risk is much smaller after wine has been clarified and stabilized and winemakers often increase the acid content of finished white wines by adding small amounts of citric acid citric 
acid 
imparts a citric character that enhances the taste of many white and blush wines however citric acid is seldom used in red wine the distinctive citric taste may not be appropriate for many types of red 
wine 
in addition the risk of biological instability is much greater in red wines 
home winemaking shops sell a material called acid blend acid blend contains tartaric malic and citric acids and the three acids are in roughly equal proportions acid blend is often used in making fruit 
wines 
or wines made from grape concentrates however most winemakers will not add acid blend to grapes before fermentation because the citric acid in the acid blend might be converted into acetic acid in 
addition 
the lemon like taste acid blend often imparts is not be suitable for many kinds of grape wines 
succinic acid 
succinic acid is formed by yeast and small quantities of this acid are always produced during the primary fermentation the production of succinic acid stops when alcoholic fermentation is complete the 
flavor of succinic acid is a complex 
mixture of sour salty and bitter tastes and succinic acid is responsible for the special taste characteristics all fermented beverages have in common once formed succinic acid is very stable and it is 
seldom affected by bacterial action 
lactic acid 
lactic acid is the principal acid found in milk grapes contain very little lactic acid all wines contain some lactic acid and some wines can contain significant quantities lactic acid in wine is formed

three different ways 1 a small amount is formed from sugar by yeast during primary fermentation 2 large amounts of lactic acid are formed from malic acid by bacteria during ml fermentation 3 both 
lactic 
and acetic acid can be produced by lactic bacteria from the sugars glycerol and even tartaric acid in the wine lactic souring is the term used to describe wine when sugar is converted into lactic acid 
by bacteria this type of souring is a form of gross wine spoilage lactic souring was a common winemaking problem before the use of sulfur dioxide became widespread but it is seldom a problem today 
lactic acid can exist in either a right hand or left hand form lactic acid produced by yeast occurs in the left hand form and lactic acid produced by bacteria occurs in the right hand form the right hand form of lactic 
acid can be distinguished from the left hand form in the laboratory very easily so winemakers have a sensitive way of monitoring bacterial activity in wine simply by measuring the two forms of lactic acid 
acetic acid 
all of the acids discussed above are fixed acids fixed acids have low vapor pressures and they do not evaporate easily when wine is boiled 
the fixed acids do not boil away all of the fixed acids remain in the wine container fixed acids do not have significant odors 
acetic acid is different from fixed acids acetic acid has a high vapor pressure and it is a volatile acid acetic acid evaporates very easily and has a distinctive 
odor when wine containing acetic acid is boiled the acetic acid quickly boils away the acetic acid disappears into the air much the same as water and alcohol 
sound grapes contain very little acetic acid just like lactic acid acetic acid in wine is formed in several different ways 1 small amounts of acetic acid 
are formed by the yeast during alcoholic fermentation 2 some acetic acid is always formed during ml fermentation and most of the acetic acid is formed 
by bacteria fermenting citric acid in the wine 3 in stuck fermentations lactic bacteria often convert residual sugar into acetic acid 4 vinegar bacteria 
acetobacter convert ethyl alcohol in the wine into acetic acid and in the presence of air acetobacter can produce large quantities of acetic acid 
the conversion of ethyl alcohol into acetic acid by vinegar bacteria is different from the other fermentation mechanisms discussed here vinegar formation is an oxidation process and large quantities of 
acetic acid cannot be produced 
unless the bacteria have access to large quantities of air wine is not converted into vinegar when air is excluded and this is why novice winemakers are cautioned to keep their wine containers 
completely filled and tightly sealed 
acid salts 
acids in juice or wine occur in two forms some acid exists in a free form and some acid combines with minerals to form acid salts the acid salts of potassium sodium and calcium are always prevalent in 
wine 
and these acid salts are not stable potassium and calcium tartrates can precipitate out of the wine after a long time in particular potassium bitartrate can precipitate after the wine is bottled unless 
the 
winemaker specifically removes this material when the tartrate precipitates out of the wine crystals are formed in the bottle the potassium bitartrate crystals are harmless cream of tarter but the 
deposits 
can cause unsightly hazes in the wine sometimes large crystals are formed in the bottle and the tartrate crystals are mistaken for glass particles by the consumer producing wines with such gross visual 
flaws 
is not good for business and commercial wineries avoid these difficult public relation problems by cold stabilizing all their white and blush wines the cold stabilization process removes the excess 
potassium bitartrate material 
summary 
grape sugars consist mostly of two monosaccharides glucose and fructose and these two simple sugars occur in about equal proportions simple sugar molecules can combine and form larger sugar molecules 
called 
disaccharides and polysaccharides both glucose and fructose can be readily fermented but most disaccharides and polysaccharides must be split into their smaller simple sugar components before they can 
be 
readily converted into alcohol many large sugar molecules can be hydrolyzed and broken into smaller molecules by enzymes acids or heat 
when sucrose table sugar is added to wine it often produces strange flavors because many weeks may be required before the wine acids can hydrolyze all of the sucrose into glucose and fructose even in a 
warm 
cellar the strange flavors can persist for several weeks however when all of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose the strange flavor completely disappears and the wine has a normal 
taste 
organic acids produce the tart taste in table wines winemakers working with grapes grown in cold climates often encourage malolactic fermentation to reduce the acid content of their wines winemakers 
working 
with grapes grown in warm climates often add tartaric acid to the juice to increase the acid content of the finished wine in either case the winemaker is striving for just the right amount of acid to 
achieve 
a balanced wine 
sometimes winemakers prefer to retain as much malic acid as possible in the wine so they deliberately discourage ml fermentation 
however red wine is not biologically stable when malic acid is retained and then the winemaker must take special 
precautions professional winemakers put wine containing malic acid through a sterile filter and remove the bacteria when the wine is bottled home winemakers prevent ml fermentation in the bottle by 
adding small amounts of fumaric acid 
potassium bitartrate can precipitate out of wine very slowly and unsightly bottle deposits are often formed when tartrates precipitate after the wine is bottled 
consequently winemakers always use a cold stabilization procedure to remove excess tartrate materials from white and blush wines before these wines are bottled 
chapter 6 
ph and sulfur dioxide 
winemakers are always concerned with titratable acid ta and ph because both parameters influence wine characteristics as discussed in the previous chapter titratable acid is primarily responsible 
for the tart taste of table wines but ph has little relationship on the tart taste however ph strongly affects several other important wine properties including color oxidation 
biological and chemical stability etc although ph depends on the total acid content other factors like potassium content influence ph and because of these other factors ph is not directly 
related to titratable acid nevertheless wine ph is a fundamental parameter ph has a profound influence on the biological and chemical effectiveness of sulfur dioxide in wine 
ph 
chemists use the ph scale to describe the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution ph uses an upside down logarithmic scale 
and because of the upside down scale a smaller ph value represents more hydrogen ions for example a wine with a ph value of 
3 0 contains ten times more hydrogen ions than in a wine with a ph of 4 0 consequently the ph value of a solution becomes smaller 
as the acid content of the solution becomes larger sometimes novice winemakers are confused by the upside down scale 
ph can be measured by several different methods but a ph meter with three digit accuracy is the most practical way of measuring wine ph 
factors affecting wine ph 
ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution consequently the ph value reflects the quantity of acids present the strength of the acids and the effects of minerals and other materials in 
the wine many different factors are involved but wine ph depends upon three major factors 1 the total amount of acid present 2 the ratio of malic acid to tartaric acid and 3 the quantity of potassium present 
these three factors are discussed below 
1 
wine acids produce hydrogen ions and ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution overall wine ph will be lower when the titratable 
acid is higher however high titratable acid does not always produce low ph values the presence of potassium and several other factors alter wine ph 
malic acid is weaker than tartaric acid so wines unusually high in malic acid can have a high ta and a high ph value high acid high ph wines require special 
treatment using an ion exchange technique however ion exchange equipment is very expensive so most small producers have difficulties handling high acid high ph wines 
2 
tartaric acid produces almost three times more hydrogen ions than malic acid so gram for gram tartaric acid produces a much lower ph than malic acid therefore when the total acid content is fixed ph depends 
upon the relative amounts of tartaric and malic acid in the juice or wine for example a wine containing an unusually large amount of malic acid might have a titratable acid of 0 65 percent and a ph of 

3 9 a second wine containing more tartaric and less malic acid might have a titratable acid of 0 65 percent but the ph might be 3 4 wine ph increases as the relative amount of malic acid increases 
3 potassium k is essential for vine growth and fruit production potassium is a mineral and vines obtain potassium through their roots the roots remove potassium from the soil and the potassium is distributed to all parts of 
the vine early in the season when the growth rate is high much of the potassium accumulates in the leaves then the potassium ions are moved from the leaves into the berries later in the season when the fruit starts to ripen 
potassium ions carry a positive electrical charge just like hydrogen ions under certain conditions potassium ions can change places with the hydrogen ions at the extreme ends of the tartaric acid molecules 
these are the hydrogens that ionize easily in water solutions and these are the hydrogens shown in bold type in figure 2 potassium bitartrate is formed 
when potassium is exchanged for hydrogen and the hydrogen then becomes a free ion in the solution tartaric acid has two hydrogen atoms that can ionize 
one of the hydrogen atoms ionizes relatively easily so tartaric acid is the strongest of the primary wine acids on the other hand potassium bitartrate 
only has one ionizable hydrogen atom and it does not ionize so easily therefore potassium bitartrate produces fewer hydrogen ions than tartaric acid 
grapes contain from one half to three grams of potassium per liter of juice grape skins contain about nine grams of potassium per liter so grape skins contain four or five times more potassium 
than the juice when grape juice and skins remain in contact for extended periods potassium leaches out of the skins into the juice the additional potassium from the skins reacts 
with tartaric acid in the juice and forms potassium bitartrate when alcohol accumulates during fermentation the juice cannot hold all the additional potassium bitartrate and some tartrates 
precipitate out of the liquid red wines usually have a lower titratable acid content and higher ph values than white or blush wines because of the extended skin contact time 
significant amounts of potassium bitartrate can also precipitate as the wine is bulk aged when potassium bitartrate precipitates 
the titratable acid of wine decreases but wine ph may increase decrease or stay the same if the starting ph of the wine is 3 6 
or less the ph will become smaller as the bitartrate precipitates out of the wine if the starting ph is 3 8 or greater the ph will 
become larger as the bitartrate precipitates little change will occur when the starting ph falls between about 3 6 and 3 8 
advantages of low ph 
over the range of 3 0 to 4 0 ph has little influence on wine taste titratable acid is primary factor determining the tart taste of table wines however ph strongly influences other important wine characteristics the 
 ph values range from about 2 9 to 4 2for most wines and this may seem like a small range however the ph scale is logarithmic and a ph change of 0 3 represents a change in hydrogen ion content of about 2 times 
the chemical stability and the biological stability are both very sensitive to the ph value of the wine and that winemakers prefer to have wine ph values between 3 0 and 3 5 chemical and biological stability are improved so much at these 
lower ph values most winemakers believe ph is the more important wine acidity parameter wine yeasts are quite tolerant of ph yeast growth does not change significantly over the normal range of wine ph values and overall fermentation 
characteristics are little affected by ph on the other hand wine bacteria do not tolerate low ph values and wine ph strongly influences both bacterial growth rate and bacterial fermentation characteristics this is why malolactic 
fermentation is not likely to occur in wines with ph values lower than 3 3 bacterial activity is reduced in low ph wines and many of the disastrous bacterial problems discussed in chapter 13 are insignificant when wine ph is low 
a variety of chemical reactions take place in wine and many of these reactions are affected by the total number of hydrogen ions present for example wine ph has a direct influence on the hot stability of wine under 
warm storage conditions protein precipitates out of white and blush wine and serious haze and sediment problems occur when protein precipitates after the wine is bottled consequently white and blush wines 
are always treated with bentonite to remove excess protein here ph is an important consideration because bentonite is more effective in removing protein when wine ph is low as the wine ph increases bentonite 
becomes less and less effective and more bentonite must be used to remove the protein excessive amounts of bentonite can strip wines of desirable aromas and flavors so adding more bentonite is not desirable 
sauvignon blanc grapes often contain large amounts of protein and sauvignon blanc wines with high ph values can be difficult to stabilize completely sometimes little 
varietal aromas remain in these wines when enough bentonite is used to remove the excess protein however wines with low ph values seldom have this problem 
wines with low ph values generally have better visual qualities at low ph values red wines show more color and the color is better color intensity increases 
and the red color becomes more purple at low ph values both red and white wines have better color stability when the ph is low some important 
polymeric reactions are accelerated at low ph values and much of the unstable color pigments precipitate out of the wine early in the winemaking process 
after the unstable pigments are gone wine colors are more stable table 4 shows how several important wine characteristics are affected by ph sulfur dioxide 
sulfur dioxide is a yellow gas formed from one sulfur and two oxygen atoms so2 it is foul smelling and noxious the distinctive smell 
left by a burnt match comes from sulfur in the match reacting with oxygen in the air and producing sulfur dioxide sulfur dioxide 
gas reacts with water and forms sulfurous acid then sulfurous acid can be further oxidized into highly corrosive sulfuric acid 
sulfur dioxide is a rather nasty material but practically all winemakers add small quantities of sulfur dioxide to their wines benefits 
sulfur dioxide has several desirable attributes when added to wine in very small quantities enzymes in the grapes that cause browning are deactivated by sulfur dioxide sulfur dioxide helps protect 
wine from excessive oxidation sulfur dioxide can reduce the oxidized smell of old wine by reacting with acetaldehyde sulfur dioxide is very useful in controlling the growth of bacteria 
and yeast man has been adding sulfur dioxide to wine for more than a thousand years a large body of knowledge exists on the use of sulfur dioxide in wine and in many other food products 
the benefits of using sulfur dioxide in wine are well documented and its positive effects are indisputable several characteristics of sulfur dioxide in wine are briefly discussed below 
deactivates enzymes 
wine low ph high ph characteristic 3 0 3 4 3 6 4 0 
oxidation less more 
amount of color more 
less 
kind of color ruby more brown 
yeast fermentation unaffected unaffected 
protein stability more stable less stable 
bacterial growth less more 
bacterial fermentation less more 
so2 activity more less 

table 4 wines with low ph values have many advantages 
grape juice is in contact with the surrounding air during the crushing and pressing operations and the juice reacts with oxygen 
in the air and becomes oxidized oxidation causes the juice to darken and the juice gradually turns brown browning is greatly 
accelerated by the presence of naturally occurring enzymes in the grapes polyphenoloxidase is the name of the this enzyme and 
it is the same enzyme that causes freshly cut apples to turn an unpleasant brown color some grape varieties brown easily 
while other grape varieties have little browning tendencies the differences in susceptibility can be accounted for by the amount 
of polyphenoloxidase enzyme that occurs in different grape varieties enzymes responsible for browning are very sensitive 
to free sulfur dioxide and the enzymes are deactivated when sulfur dioxide is added to the juice the quantity of sulfur dioxide 
needed is very small so sulfur dioxide is a powerful tool for reducing enzymatic browning in white and blush wines 
inhibits oxidation 
the great french scientist pasteur observed oxygen is the ardent enemy of wine air is always present and oxygen in the air is always ready to react with unprotected juice or wine grape juice and 
wine contain a variety of materials and many of these substances are adversely affected by oxidation unpleasant bitter off odors and off tastes can be produced when these materials oxidize of 
course wine components are subjected to small amounts of oxygen throughout the lengthy winemaking process many of the desirable changes that take place during bulk aging are oxidation reactions 
so oxidation does not necessarily produce adverse changes when small amounts of oxygen are introduced very slowly however wine quality is reduced quickly when oxidation becomes excessive 
when small quantities of sulfur dioxide are added to grapes or wine roughly half the amount added quickly combines with other wine constituents the uncombined half remains in the wine in a free state only the 
uncombined or free sulfur dioxide is effective in the free state the sulfur dioxide reacts quickly and combines with any oxygen before any of the other wine constituents become oxidized sulfur dioxide is one
pounds sulfite of fruit grams 
of the most effective methods available for controlling oxidation and most winemakers add enough sulfur dioxide when the grapes are crushed to give 30 to 50 milligrams of so2 per liter the recommended 
amount of sulfite powder is shown in table 5 twice as much sulfur dioxide is sometimes used when the grapes are very warm or when they contain rot this initial dose of so2 deactivates the 
browning enzymes and helps prevent oxidation during crushing and pressing considerable oxidation takes place when wine is bottled and oxidation at this time can be very detrimental newly bottled 
wine will be short lived unless adequate sulfur dioxide is present and winemakers raise the free sulfur dioxide content of their wines to about 30 milligrams per liter just before bottling 
removes oxidized smell 
acetaldehyde is the material responsible for the characteristic smell of sherry wines and acetaldehyde can be thought of as oxidized ethyl alcohol although desirable in sherry this 
distinctive odor is not desirable in table wines acetaldehyde is produce when wine oxidizes and too much acetaldehyde is one of the more common defects in homemade table wines

table 5 recommended initial sulfite additions 
acetaldehyde is an intermediate product when sugar is converted into alcohol and practically all of the free sulfur dioxide disappears during fermentation by combining with acetaldehyde 
since very little free sulfur dioxide remains in the wine additional sulfur dioxide must be added when fermentation is finished the recommended practice is to add enough sulfur 
dioxide to combine with any remaining acetaldehyde and leave 20 to 30 milligrams of so2 per liter of wine most winemakers routinely add about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide 
to newly completed fermentations then about 30 milligrams per liter of free so2 is maintained in the wine during the lengthy clarification stabilization and aging period 
inhibits bacteria and yeasts 
the initial dose of 30 to 50 milligrams per liter of so2 added at the crusher also provides the winemaker an effective way of controlling 
fermentation most commercially prepared wine yeasts have considerable tolerance for sulfur dioxide but the activity of wild yeast is 
greatly diminished by small amounts of so2 when small quantities of sulfur dioxide and commercial wine yeast are used to start fermentation 
the inoculated yeasts multiply quickly and the commercial yeasts dominate the wild yeasts throughout the fermentation period 
small quantities of sulfur dioxide can eliminate many undesirable bacteria when used at reasonable concentrations so2 helps control vinegar bacteria and 
protection against vinegar bacteria is very important in all wineries sulfur dioxide can also inhibit malolactic bacterial activity so winemakers 
use so2to help control malolactic fermentation sulfur dioxide can exist in wine as free sulfur dioxide or as fixed sulfur dioxide the effectiveness 
of sulfur dioxide in controlling wine microbes depends primarily on the form of sulfur dioxide and only free sulfur dioxide is biologically active 
moreau and vinet studied the antiseptic properties of sulfur dioxide in wine and they concluded that molecular so2 was the effective form fornachon 
studied the characteristics of both fixed and free so2 in australian wines and he showed several types of wine bacteria including lactobacillus 
could be controlled by very small quantities of molecular sulfur dioxide several other sulfur dioxide studies have been done and they clearly 
show 0 5 to 1 5 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide can provide good microbial stability in both dry and sweet wines 
today most winemakers feel that 0 8 milligrams of molecular sulfur dioxide per liter of wine provides adequate protection for 
dry table wines consequently most commercial wineries maintain at least 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide 
in their wines from the completion of fermentation until the wine is bottled since molecular sulfur dioxide is the biologically 
effective form winemakers are always interested in how much of the sulfur dioxide in a wine exists in the molecular form 
ph and sulfur dioxide 
when sulfur dioxide is added to wine some sulfur dioxide combines with other materials in the wine and becomes fixed the remainder of the sulfur dioxide remains in a free form the free sulfur dioxide exists in three different 
forms the molecular form the bisulfite form and the doubly ionized sulfite form the fraction of free sulfur dioxide that exists in the molecular form is strongly dependent upon the ph of the wine since only the molecular 
sulfur dioxide is effective winemakers are always interested in how much of the free so2 exists in the molecular form the amount of free sulfur dioxide in a wine can be measured easily on the other hand the fraction of free 
sulfur dioxide that exists in the molecular form is difficult to measure fortunately the amount of molecular sulfur dioxide can be easily calculated when the free sulfur dioxide content and the ph of the wine are known 
amount of so2 needed 
the free sulfur dioxide needed to produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular so2 for different values of wine ph is shown 
in table 6 the free sulfur dioxide is given in milligrams per liter mg/l for example table 6 shows that 32 milligrams 
of free sulfur dioxide per liter of wine will produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide in a wine having a ph of 3 4 these data clearly show the amount of molecular sulfur dioxide in a wine is strongly 
dependent upon wine ph these data also show that acceptably small quantities of free sulfur dioxide will produce enough molecular sulfur dioxide to provide good microbial stability when wine ph is less than about 3 6 however when the 
ph exceeds 3 8 or so significantly large quantities of sulfur dioxide are required at high values of wine ph prohibitively large quantities of free sulfur dioxide are needed to produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular so2 
summary 
titratable acid is a measure of the total quantity of all the acids in a wine and ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a wine several factors influence wine ph wines containing little

table 6 wine ph determines 
the quantity of free so2 needed to 
produce 0 8 mg/l of molecular 
sulfur dioxide 

acid and lots of potassium have high ph values more tartaric acid less malic acid less potassium and greater titratable acid result in smaller ph values 
low wine ph values inhibit wine bacteria but wine yeasts are not affected when wine has a low ph sugar fermentation progresses more evenly and malolactic fermentation is easier to control bentonite 
is more effective in removing excess protein from wines with low ph values in addition red wines with low ph values have more and better color and white wines do not brown as easily 
the situation is much different when wine ph values are high bacteria multiply rapidly in high ph wines and unwanted bacterial fermentations become more troublesome high ph wines are less biologically stable 
and they have poorer chemical stability red and white wines have poorer color when the ph is high wines with high ph values always require more attention and greater care than wines with low ph values 
only the molecular form of sulfur dioxide is effective against wine microbes when wine ph is low very small additions of free sulfur dioxide give winemakers 
an effective tool for managing wine microbes in wines with high ph values excessive quantities of sulfur dioxide are needed to control microbes effectively 
controlling microorganisms is very important so winemakers maintain 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide in their wines from the completion 
of the fermentations until the wine is bottled however such small quantities of free sulfur dioxide will not be adequate unless wine ph is low

winery sanitation 
winemakers are responsible for many different activities but one of his or her most important duties is to make certain the winery is maintained in a 
clean sanitary condition dirty cellar conditions can result in wines with strange off odors and off flavors wine acts like a sponge and it absorbs 
all kinds of odors many homemade wines are afflicted with off odors and off flavors and usually these problems can be attributed to a lack of 
cleanliness or to poor storage conditions unless strict sanitary conditions are maintained in the storage area wine quality is always at risk 
although winery sanitation is very important many beginning winemakers do not understand the methods and materials needed to establish and maintain clean sanitary winemaking conditions 
basic sanitation rules 
the basic principles of sanitation and the ways these principles are applied in the wine industry can be found in a wine institute publication by davison 
1963 titled sanitation guide for wineries this document identifies the following issues as most important for maintaining basic winery sanitation 
1 keep the winery clean and free of refuse both inside and outside 
2 inspect the winery premises the equipment and the cooperage at least once each month and do this inspection on a regularly scheduled basis 
3 keep all winery equipment clean and in good working condition equipment should be arranged in an orderly way and the work areas kept free of clutter 
4 use plenty of clean water sterilizing materials and cleaning agents and the entire winery should be cleaned on a regularly scheduled basis 
5 get rid of harmful bacteria yeast mold insects and rodents then take any measures necessary to prevent a recurrence of these pests 

although these rules may seem obvious they should not be taken for granted and every home winemaker should carefully consider just how these five rules apply to his or her particular winemaking situation 
wash equipment just before it is used then wash everything again when the job is finished is another simple but very effective winery sanitation rule most winery residues can be easily rinsed away 
when wet but grape residues are very difficult to remove after they become dry cleaning dried grape muck out of a fifty foot length of transfer hose is a difficult and frustrating task the clean 
before and clean after rule seems to imply twice as much work however this is not so and the rule will save a tremendous amount of time and labor if it is conscientiously applied practically all 
large wineries practice and rigidly enforce this rule this rule is particularly important for small producers because they often do not have high pressure washers or steam cleaning equipment pomace 
pomace should be removed from the winery promptly and all the pomace should be disposed of in a suitable way pomace should never be allowed to accumulate near active fermentations even sweet pomace acetifies 
quickly in hot weather and starts turning into vinegar then the pile of pomace is sure to attract fruit flies and the flies then carry acetic acid bacteria from the pomace pile into the active fermentations 
putting pomace back into the vineyard is the preferred method of disposal when pomace is spread in a thin layer it dries quickly and becomes high quality compost material unfortunately most 
home winemakers do not have access to vineyards so they must find other ways to dispose of their pomace a method that works well in some urban areas is to place 20 to 30 pounds of pomace 
in large plastic trash bags then the bags are placed at the curb on trash collection day some wineries rent an extra trash dumpster for several weeks each crush season and this is a very 
convenient and effective way of disposing of pomace for small producers arrangements must be made to have the dumpster emptied promptly or the pomace will acetify and attract fruit flies 
cleaning agents 
many proprietary cleaning agents have been developed specifically for use in the wine and food industries and these materials have properties that make them 
particularly suitable for the intended job however sources of proprietary cleaning materials can be difficult to find many cleaning materials are supplied 
by the manufacturer in 50 pound bags or in large drums and such large quantities are not suitable for small producers fortunately several common household 
cleaning materials give reasonable performance in the small winery and these materials are readily available in small quantities at the corner market 
sanitation procedures used in the winery cannot be effective unless the proper material is used and the material must be used in the correct concentration and for a minimum amount of time in 
addition some sanitation materials must be applied at elevated temperatures often application time and application temperature function together some typical examples are shown in table 7

sometimes lacking 
generally any cleaning products with artificial odors should be avoided and highly perfumed liquid detergents are particularly bad strong perfumes can be difficult to rinse away from winery surfaces and microscopically 
porous materials like polyethylene can retain the perfume scent for a very long time unscented detergents are available but sometimes these products are difficult to find at the local market 
phosphates 
sodium phosphate is an excellent water softener and it is one of the better winery cleaning materials sodium phosphate is the principal ingredient of many automatic dishwasher 
powders and in this form sodium phosphate is inexpensive and readily available phosphate based detergents are often used for soaking off labels and cleaning used wine bottles 
ctsp 
chlorinated tri sodium phosphate ctsp is the work horse cleaning agent in both commercial and home wineries the best defense against contamination in small wineries is chlorinated tsp 
a stiff brush hot water and lots of elbow grease ctsp is readily available and it lifts dirt well the chlorine is a powerful sterilizer and in this form chlorine is easier to rinse 
away solutions of ctsp feel soapy or slippery when mixed at a useful strength and one to four tablespoons of ctsp in a gallon of hot water produces a useful concentration tsp can 
be hard on hands and rubber gloves should be worn when strong solutions are used some automatic dishwasher powders contain significant amounts of chlorinated tri sodium phosphate 
hypochlorite 
clorox sodium hypochlorite is an inexpensive and readily available source of chlorine sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in clorox this material is a powerful oxidizer and it is 
one of the most potent disinfectants readily available to home winemakers unfortunately clorox does not rinse away easily in cold water and clorox is particularly difficult to remove 
from porous materials many home winemaking books condemn this material because clorox is so potent and so difficult to rinse completely even so commercial wineries use large quantities 
of sodium hypochlorite because it is such an efficient sanitizer unscented clorox can be purchased at any super market it is all the same material so buy theleast expensive brand 
the following procedure is recommended when clorox is used to sterilize wine containers first the surfaces of the tank are scrubbed with a clorox solution then the surfaces are rinsed two or 
three times with clean water next the surfaces are rinsed with a solution consisting of one tablespoon of sulfite crystals in a gallon of water sulfur dioxide and chlorine combine quickly 
and the residue washes away easily finally the tank surfaces are rinsed again with clean water to remove any sulfur dioxide residue all strong cleaning products must be used with caution 
and full strength clorox must be handled with special care under some conditions clorox can produce poisonous chlorine gas do not breathe clorox fumes and do not get clorox on clothing 
rinse carefully 
after winemaking equipment has been scrubbed down all of the cleaning material must be removed from surfaces that can contact wine if doubt exists the surfaces should be rinsed again completely 
all of the cleaning agents listed above will do a better job of cleaning when they are used with hot water and these materials also rinse away more easily when hot water is used 
cleaning aids 
a good adjustable nozzle attached to a garden hose is the primary piece of cleaning equipment in most small wineries the nozzle should provide several spray patterns including a strong high velocity stream and the nozzle should 
not leak the hose and nozzle will be dropped from time to time so the nozzle should be of rugged construction hang the hose with the nozzle attached in a convenient spot in the crush area and many steps will be saved 
special long handled brushes are made for washing automobile hub caps and these brushes are very convenient for scrubbing small tanks containers and most winemaking equipment these long handled 
brushes can be purchased in the automotive departments of large stores they are inexpensive and a couple of these brushes are very handy for all kinds of cleaning jobs in any small winery 
home winemakers use an assortment of bottle brushes for cleaning stubborn residues from the inside surfaces of used wine bottles jugs and carboys these brushes have long twisted wire handles 
and they are manufactured in many sizes 
jet carboy washers are a great aid when washing old wine bottles this little brass gadget attaches to a water faucet or a garden hose and delivers a powerful jet of water to the inside surfaces of any bottle or jug 
the water starts flowing when a bottle is placed in position and automatically turns the water off when the bottle is removed often little scrubbing 
with a bottle brush is necessary if dirty bottles are soaked for two or three days and then power rinsed with a jet carboy washer 
equipment 
proper winery sanitation includes cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces that can contact wine all winemaking equipment including the crusher and the press should be scrubbed with a ctsp solution after scrubbing 
the equipment must be carefully rinsed with lots of clean water then the equipment should be washed again with plain water immediately after use before any residue has time to dry after the second washing the equipment 
should be drained carefully then when the equipment is completely dry it can be safely stored away novice winemakers should try to develop a habit of washing winery equipment before and immediately after each use 
hoses and tubing 
hoses and tubing should be cleaned much the same as other pieces of winemaking equipment however scrubbing the inside surfaces is practically impossible so hoses and tubing require special 
care a strong ctsp solution removes soil efficiently when used promptly but the tubing should be rinsed several times with clean water to make sure no ctsp remains on the inside surfaces 
mold starts to grow in a short time if water is allowed to stand in a hose wineries hang their hoses with both ends down so any water 
can drain completely special hose racks for this purpose are constructed from wood plastic or metal home winemakers often 
make hose racks from scrap wood or from several nails appropriately placed hanging hoses from a single nail will cause permanent 
kinks if a length of hose or tubing becomes heavily stained or contaminated with mold try a treatment of full strength clorox 
tanks and carboys 
the clean before and clean after rule also applies to carboys and tanks two types of tank residues are often encountered and both types are difficult to remove 
even when the tank is cleaned promptly an ugly brown deposit often forms near the top of small fermenters and this material can be quite difficult to 
remove a good stiff brush and chlorinated tri sodium phosphate are recommended for this job sometimes this type of residue occurs right at the shoulder of 
a glass or plastic carboy and it is very difficult to reach here the handle of a large bottle brush should be bent and extra effort should be applied 
a second type of cleaning problem arises when a carboy or tank has been in use for several years and the inside surface has become coated with a heavy tartrate deposit the tartrate causes no harm if the coating 
is not excessively thick and if it does not contain a large quantity of trapped lees in fact a moderate tartrate coating will accelerate the cold stabilization of any new wine stored in the container 
however after several years the tartrate coating becomes thick rough and contaminated with trapped lees 
now the tartrate coating must be removed heavy tartrate deposits are difficult to remove with cold water but they can be removed quickly with a solution made of a half cup of sodium carbonate 
in a gallon of hot water and a stiff bristled brush thin deposits of tartrate in small tanks or carboys can be removed easily by filling the container with plain water for twenty four hours 
used wine bottles 
cleaning and sterilizing old wine bottles is not fun nevertheless the high cost of new glass about 6 00 a case compels many home winemakers to rely on recycled 
wine bottles the inside surfaces of dirty wine bottles are an ideal environment for a variety of molds yeasts and bacteria and large colonies are often 
seen growing on the dried residue dirty used bottles are always a potential source of contamination so dirty bottles should not be stored in the winemaking 
area a safer procedure is to clean the bottles as they are collected then the clean bottles should be stored points down in clean cardboard cartons 
used bottles are difficult to clean properly the usual procedure is to soak the dirty bottles in water for a few days soaking loosens the dried wine residue and the inevitable mold colonies some winemakers 
add a half cup of tsp to the water to speed up the soaking process after soaking the bottles can be scrubbed with a bottle brush using hot water and a strong phosphate based detergent a cup of automatic 
dishwasher powder in two gallons of hot water makes a good bottle cleaning solution after the bottles have been thoroughly washed they should be carefully rinsed drained and dried a jet carboy washer 
will save time and hot water when many bottles are being washed washed bottles will remain sanitary for some time if they are placed upside down in clean cardboard cases and stored in a dry place 
barrels 
used empty barrels are difficult to maintain the first time a new barrel is filled with wine more than three gallons of wine soaks into the wood surfaces 
later when a barrel is stored empty the wine soaked into the wood quickly acetifies the wine in the wood turns to vinegar and the barrel becomes 
contaminated with vinegar bacteria some home winemaking books recommend cleaning barrels contaminated with vinegar bacteria with soda ash however 
sterilizing contaminated barrels is practically impossible experienced winemakers use their noses and discard barrels smelling of vinegar 
empty barrels can be safely stored for several weeks if they are gassed with sulfur dioxide and kept tightly sealed home winemakers and small commercial wineries burn sulfur wicks in their barrels large wineries 
purchase sulfur dioxide gas in high pressure cylinders barrels gassed with sulfur dioxide should be washed with clean water before they are filled winemakers face another serious problem when empty 
barrels are stored for long times after several weeks the wood in an empty barrel becomes dry and the staves start to shrink as the wood shrinks the hoops become loose and the barrel loses its shape in hot 
dry climates barrels often fall to pieces in a few months at best empty barrels leak badly when first filled and several days of soaking are often required before these barrels can be filled with wine 
barrels can be maintained for extended periods if they are stored wet first the barrel is washed several times with clean cold water then the barrel is half filled with clean water and a cup of sulfite powder and a cup of citric 
acid are added then the barrel is completely filled with water and bunged tight the sulfite/acid solution will keep the barrel in good condition for some time but after several months the sulfite/acid solution must be replaced 
unfortunately barrels stored in this way lose their oak character just as if they were filled with wine new 60 gallon french oak barrels sell for about 600 and american 
barrels sell for about 200 storing expensive barrels filled with water shortens the effective life of the barrels so this method is only used for older inert barrels 
commercial wineries seldom store empty barrels they keep their expensive oak cooperage full of wine when aged wine is removed for bottling the barrels are washed with clean water and immediately refilled with new wine some 
home winemakers also use this method to maintain their barrels in good condition however keeping barrels filled with wine requires bottling last years wine during the busy crush season so careful planning is needed 
summary 
sanitation is an important part of winemaking and good housekeeping is necessary in any winery many proprietary cleaning agents are available but most small wineries and home winemakers rely on common cleaning agents like 
sodium phosphate automatic dishwasher powder chlorinated tsp and clorox the wash everything just before use and again after use winemaking rule should always be practiced hoses can be maintained easily if they are washed 
immediately after use the wet hoses should be hung on a wall with both ends pointing down then they can drain and dry out completely the bacteria yeasts and molds that grow so profusely on the bottoms of old dirty wine 
bottles represent a constant source of contamination consequently dirty used wine bottles should not be stored in winemaking areas dirty bottles should be washed and sterilized and stored away in a sanitary condition 
maintaining empty oak barrels in good condition is difficult small producers burn sulfur wicks in their empty barrels large wineries fill their empty barrels 
with sulfur dioxide gas from high pressure cylinders experienced winemakers avoid empty barrels by immediately refilling their barrels with new wine 
chapter 8 

crush season 
crush seasons only lasts about eight weeks and wineries must pick transport and crush all the grapes needed for their annual supply of wine in that short time crush seasons are busy hectic times 
for winery personnel and twelve or fourteen hour workdays are quite common winemakers make many decisions during this busy period and many of these decisions must be made quickly unfortunately 
hastily made decisions often result in poor wine quality most commercial winemakers prepare a detailed crush plan early each season to reduce the number of these high risk decisions crush seasons 
are not so hectic for home winemakers nevertheless home winemakers have the same kinds of problems each year and most home winemakers also benefit from well thought out crush plans 
deciding what varieties of wine will be made is the first step in developing a crush plan then the winemaker decides how many gallons of each variety will be produced once the varieties 
and quantities have been established the more detailed winemaking issues such as potential sources of grapes fruit costs equipment cleaning cooperage requirements etc can be addressed 
most home winemakers have limited time during crush season and even routine chores such as repairing and cleaning equipment need to be planned well in advance crush 
plans should be formulated many weeks before harvest time and then the plan should be followed until all of the new wines are safely stored away in the cellar 
fruit quantity 
the quantity of wine produced from a ton of grapes is called wine yield and wine yield depends on the variety of the grapes the type of equipment available the winemaking techniques used etc 
professional winemakers using modern horizontal presses often get 160 or 170 gallons of quality wine from a ton of fruit home winemakers generally use small vertical basket presses and home 
winemakers seldom get more than 150 gallons per ton consequently most home winemakers require 13 or 14 pounds of grapes for each gallon of wine when small batches of red wine are made at 
home without a crusher or press wine yields will be much lower and about twenty pounds of grapes will be needed for each gallon of wine making white wine without a press is not feasible 
wine containers must be kept completely full of wine throughout the winemaking process wine stored in barrels evaporates and significant quantities of wine are lost each time wine is racked 
wine containers must be topped up periodically extra wine is always needed to keep the containers full so winemakers routinely produce extra wine 10 15% to use as topping material 
getting grapes from the same vineyard each season is always an advantage winemakers learn what to expect from the fruit when grapes from the same 
vineyard are processed year after year after a few seasons the winemaker knows what adjustments are needed and he or she can fine tune the wine 
easily these small adjustments are important to wine quality so winemakers prefer to work with fruit from the same vineyards each season sometimes 
novice home winemakers believe grapes are grapes but they learn the value of quality fruit and grape source continuity after a few harvests 
buying grapes 
wine grapes are bought and sold by the ton and higher prices are usually paid when home winemakers purchase fruit in much smaller quantities this is why many home winemakers pool together each season and 
purchase grapes in ton quantities grapes are hauled from the vineyard in field lugs picking boxes holding about 40 pounds half ton bins one ton tanks and in large gondolas when small quantities of fruit are 
purchased from a vineyard the size of the containers used can be important a serious problem can develop when a ton of fruit is needed and the grapes are coming out of the vineyard in five ton gondolas 
when grapes are purchased from an outside source the grower should be contacted early in the season grape growers like to have their grapes sold well before harvest time so purchase arrangements are best made well before the fourth of july 
the growers harvest criteria should be discussed and carefully considered some growers harvest as early as possible each season and red grapes are often picked very close to 22 5 brix trying to make a big red 
wine from under ripe grapes is not realistic and if the growers harvest criteria is not compatible with the style of wine planned the winemaker should look for another source of grapes who will pick and the 
price of the grapes should be clearly established when purchases are made from outside sources 
harvest time depends on many factors and picking times vary from year to year the grape varieties vineyard location soil weather conditions and irrigation schedules all influence harvest times rain late in 
the season often delays picking by a week or two many variables are involved and accurately predicting when grapes will be ripe is nearly impossible consequently winemakers should keep in touch with the 
vineyard and follow the development of the grapes as they ripen then the winemaker will be ready to process the grapes promptly when harvest time finally arrives 
expecting commercial growers to sell their highest quality fruit to home winemakers is not realistic commercial growers prefer to use their best quality fruit to entice large wineries into multi year 
contracts five seven or even ten year fruit contracts are often beneficial to both the grower and the winery practically all of the highest quality wine grapes are sold under long term contracts so home 
winemakers are always at a disadvantage when attempting to buy quality grapes on the open market a few home winemakers plant their own vineyards and produce estate wines simply because high quality 
grapes are so difficult to buy warm fruit 
oxidation and other changes start to occur when the grapes are picked and fruit should be loaded transported and processed quickly to minimize these changes however exceptions to the above rule are sometimes 
necessary when grapes are picked late in the afternoon on a hot day under these condition the grapes may be very warm hot fermentations are difficult at best so in this situation letting the fruit sit 
overnight and cool down may be the lesser of two evils larger wineries cool warm fruit with large refrigeration systems small wineries and home winemakers try to avoid warm fruit on harvest day small 
producers get to the vineyard early while the grapes are cold then they load transport and process the grapes quickly 
unfortunately home winemakers seldom have much control over when or how the grapes are picked large vineyards must cater to local 
wineries and grapes going to a winery are usually the first to be picked and loaded handling small quantities of grapes 
is often difficult for large vineyards and the grower is usually doing the home winemaker a favor therefore when a home winemaker picks up a ton of grapes he or she often has little choice and must accept warm fruit picked late in the day 
growing grapes 
many professional and amateur winemakers prefer to grow their own grapes because having complete supervision of the vineyard gives the winemaker 
the greatest control over grape quality most home winemakers are never able to purchase really high quality fruit so when a home 
winemaker is determined to make quality wines his only alternative is to plant a small vineyard when suitable space and water are available 
planting a few hundred vines is a practical solution to the high quality fruit dilemma and more home winemakers are becoming growers 
materials for a standard two wine trellis and a drip irrigation system range in cost from 1 000 to 4000 per acre sometimes secondhand vineyard materials 
can be found and the savings can be quite large vines can be grown on their own roots in areas where the phylloxera root louse is not 
a problem cuttings can be planted in these areas and cuttings are easier faster and less expensive to plant than rooted stock often cuttings 
can be obtained for nothing each year at pruning time and when cuttings are planted with reasonable care a 95 percent take can be expected yields 
crop yields from any vineyard depend upon the grape variety weather soil conditions water etc yields of one to two tons of grapes per acre are common in old unirrigated coastal 
vineyards in the central valley heavily fertilized and 
irrigated vineyards planted with carignane grenache or zinfandel grapes often produce twelve or more tons per acre however at these high crop levels the color is 
eficient the acid level low and overall fruit quality is often poor 
yields of four or five tons per acre can be expected for well grown high quality grape varieties if an acre containing 600 vines produces four tons of grapes each vine would be producing about 
13 pounds of grapes thirteen pounds of grapes will make about a gallon of wine so an average vine might produce about one gallon of wine each year however one gallon of wine per vine may 
be too optimistic for small isolated vineyards such yields apply to large mature vineyards managed by experienced grape growers small vineyards are more difficult to manage successfully and 
small isolated vineyards are more susceptible to deer coyote rabbit bird bee and wasp damage home vineyards planted with cabernet or chardonnay grapes often average about two tons per acre 
getting ready 

conscientious winemakers take a complete inventory of winemaking materials and supplies and orders for needed cellar supplies are placed then all of the equipment is assembled inspected and repaired several weeks before 
harvest time then when each piece of equipment is in good working order all of the equipment is cleaned carefully conscientious winemakers are prepared to make wine long before the first grapes of the season are picked 
supplies 
orders for winemaking supplies should be placed several weeks before harvest time because suppliers are very busy just before 
and during a crush season home winemakers often get together and order winemaking supplies in commercial quantities 
to reduce their winemaking costs for example a 500 gram package of prise de mousse active dry yeast cost 8 50 in 1997 the cost of a 5 gram envelope of the same yeast was 0 75 so buying yeast in five gram envelopes can be expensive 
home winemakers bottling twenty or so cases 50 gallons of wine a year will need the following winemaking supplies each crush season 
tartaric and citric acid 
active dry wine yeast 
malolactic bacteria optional 
yeast nutrients di ammonium phosphate yeast hulls superfood etc 
sulfite powder 
fining materials bentonite gelatin and sparkolloid 
filter materials pads or cartridges 
laboratory test chemicals 
sanitation materials chlorinated tsp clorox etc 

equipment 
most winemakers assemble inspect and test their equipment several weeks before harvest time all machinery should be checked for rust and corrosion and motor powered equipment should be inspected 
for cracked belts and frayed electrical cords rusty equipment should be scraped sanded or sandblasted then the clean surfaces can be painted when all repairs are complete the 
equipment should be tested for proper function when everything is in good working condition the equipment should be scrubbed with a chlorinated tsp solution then the equipment should be 
rinsed with clean water several times and drained completely all winemaking equipment should be in good working condition clean and ready for use before the first grapes are expected 
tanks 
all empty tanks drums and other containers should be checked for leaks after any needed repairs have been made the containers should be scrubbed 
with a chlorinated tsp solution then the containers should be rinsed several times with clean water and drained drums carboys and other 
small containers can be stored away until needed in a few wineries several weeks of hectic bottling are required each crush season because the 
tanks are full of last years wine most winemakers do not postpone bottling and they have clean empty tanks well before the crush season 
barrels 
empty barrels should be checked for acetification or moldy smells or off odors and novice winemakers must learn to trust their noses when cleaning and testing wood cooperage sweet smelling barrels 
should be filled with clean water and carefully checked for leaks sometimes leaky barrels must be soaked for several days to swell the stays and stop the leaks then the barrels should 
be sterilized either by burning a sulfur wick or by filling the barrel with so2 gas from a high pressure cylinder barrels sterilized with sulfur dioxide can be held in good condition for 
several weeks if they are kept tightly bunged to retain the sulfur dioxide gas barrels stored in this way must be rinsed with clean water immediately before they are filled with wine 
empty barrels stored for more than a few months will require extra attention 
summary 
lots of things can and do go wrong during crush and most winemakers develop detailed crush plans early each year to reduce the number of quickly made high risk decisions 
most winemaking materials keep well but sulfite powder yeast and laboratory reagents should be replaced each season orders for winemaking 
supplies should be placed early in the season because suppliers are very busy just before and throughout the crush season 
generally large vineyards prefer to sell their grapes early in the season and outside fruit sources should be contacted and arrangements to buy grapes should be made early 
all winemaking equipment should be inspected repaired and put in good working condition then the equipment should be scrubbed rinsed and completely drained the equipment should be 
ready to use long before the expected harvest time 
most winemakers try to go into the crush season with a well thought out crush plan adequate winemaking supplies clean functional equipment and empty tanks 
chapter 9 

harvest 
chardonnay and pinot noir are early ripening grape varieties and they are among the first grapes picked each year cabernet sauvignon nebbiolo and carignane are late varieties and these varieties 
are the last grape varieties picked in southern california the crush usually starts in mid august and ends in october harvest times vary from year to year in early years the grapes are picked 
two or three weeks earlier than normal in late years carignane grapes are often picked in late october the start of the grape harvest depends primarily on accumulated heat the grape harvest 
in northern coastal regions starts about three weeks later than in southern california for a given location most of the grapes are harvested each year during a seven or eight week period 
harvest decisions 
high quality wine can only be made from high quality grapes the quality of the grapes always determines the potential quality of the wine if the grapes are picked too early or too 
late wine quality will suffer wine made from under ripe grapes often has a green characteristic these wines contain excess acid lack color lack flavor intensity and lack varietal 
character when grapes are picked too late the wine is high in alcohol and low in acidity often wines produced from overripe fruit have stewed fruit raisin or prune flavors quality 
wine can only be made from high quality properly ripened fruit and deciding exactly when to pick the grapes is the most important decision a winemaker makes each crush season 
unfortunately ripe wine grapes are very perishable and grapes are at their best for just a few days in warm growing areas the short harvest interval and crop sizes of several tons per acre 
create serious harvest problems for winemakers coordinating harvest activities and crush operations is difficult and crush seasons are busy and sometimes hectic periods at any winery 
when to pick the grapes is such an important decision that most winemakers start sampling grapes several weeks before harvest time as harvest day approaches the winemaker goes 
to the vineyard every few days to sample the fruit he looks at the condition of the vines and he tests the texture of the berries by gently squeezing them between his 
thumb and forefinger the grapes are visually examined and tasted the pulp is smelled and the color of the seeds are examined then the winemaker collects a representative 
sample of several hundred berries from each vineyard when the winemaker returns to the winery he measures the titratable acid ph and sugar content of the sample grapes 
acid content 
tartaric and malic acids make up about 90 percent of the total organic acid content in grapes malic acid is found in many different varieties of fruit but only grapes contain significant amounts of tartaric 
acid the amounts of tartaric acid and malic acid are about equal when grapes start to change color and soften veraison and the quantity of tartaric acid remains roughly constant throughout the 
ripening period on the other hand the quantity of malic acid decreases as the grapes ripen and the loss of malic acid results in a gradual decrease in the total acid content during the ripening period 
in hot growing regions much of the malic acid is gone by harvest time depending upon the variety and the growing conditions grape juice contains 1 5 to 5 times more tartaric acid than malic acid 
in cold viticulture regions ripe grapes have an acid content ranging from 0 7 to 1 3 percent such high acidity often results in excessively tart wine to avoid excess tartness winemakers in cold growing regions use 
special procedures to reduce wine acidity the situation is quite different when grapes are grown in warm regions like the interior valleys of california here the acid content of ripe grapes often falls between 
0 4 and 0 8 percent grapes grown in such warm climates often have too little acidity and wine produced from grapes low in acidity is often bland and flat tasting besides producing bland wines fermenting 
grapes low in acidity often results in other problems and adding acid to grapes grown in warm regions is a standard winemaking practice large acid additions are best made before fermentation is started 
the acid content of grapes or wine is usually measured using a procedure called titration sometimes winemakers call the acid content total acid but 
the preferred term is titratable acid titration measures the sum of all the different types of acids in the wine but the results are expressed 
as if all of the acids were tartaric acid french winemakers use a different convention they express titratable acid as if all the acids present were 
sulfuric acid these different customs result in different numbers and sometimes novice winemakers are confused by the different conventions 
ph 
grape acids differ considerably in strength tartaric acid is stronger than malic acid and malic acid is stronger than citric acid a quantity called ph is used to measure the strength of the acids and ph is defined 
using an inverse logarithmic scale high acid grapes have a low ph and low acid grapes have a high ph because of the upside down scale ph values range from 2 8 to 4 2 for juices obtained from sound ripe grapes yea 
as grapes ripen malic acid is lost and the acid content decreases as the acidity decreases the ph value of the grape juice slowly increases late in the ripening process just as the grapes are reaching maturity potassium 
ions start accumulating in the juice the potassium ions interact with acids in the grapes and this interaction causes the ph of the juice to increase more rapidly just as the grapes are reaching maturity 
several weeks before expected harvest time winemakers start their annual crush routine they visit the vineyards every few days and collect grape samples then the grape samples 
are tested for sugar titratable acid and the ph in the winery laboratory winemakers use the ph sugar and ta data to help decide when the grapes should be picked 
sugar content 
historically sugar content was the primary indicator of grape ripeness and many growers still rely on sugar readings to decide when the grapes are ripe consequently obtaining accurate sugar 
measurements is important grape sugar content is usually measured in units of degrees brix and the measurement is made with a hydrometer or a hand held optical instrument called 
a refractometer the accuracy of either instrument depends upon temperature most instruments are calibrated at a temperature of 68 degrees fahrenheit and a correction must be applied 
to the readings when measurements are made at any other temperature some refractometers are temperature compensated and the compensation greatly reduces the temperature error 
refractometers are handy sugar measurement instruments because they can measure the sugar content of a single drop of juice with 
good accuracy in most instruments each degree is subdivided into five parts and a value of 0 2 brix can be read directly 
on the refractometer scale well built temperature compensated refractometers cost about 300 and good uncompensated instruments 
can be purchased for less than 150 most winemakers prefer compensated instruments but data obtained with an uncompensated 
refractometer can easily be corrected for temperature the 
major advantage of refractometers is their ability to measure very 
small samples of juice quickly and easily temp correction 
both short range 16 to 25 brix and long range 2 to 30 brix 56 0 38 
hydrometers are available short range instruments cost about 58 0 32 
twenty dollars and long range hydrometers cost less than ten 60 0 26 
dollars the scale on good short range hydrometers can be read 62 0 20 
directly to 0 1 brix and good hydrometers have a certified 64 0 14 
calibration about 100 milliliters of juice are required to make a 66 0 08 
measurement when hydrometers are used with small diameter 68 0 00 
cylinders despite their low cost good hydrometers are more 70 +0 07 
accurate than hand held refractometers 72 +0 14 
74 +0 22 
the accuracy of measurements taken with hydrometers also 76 +0 30 
depends on temperature hydrometers must be used at their 78 +0 38 
calibration temperature or a correction for temperature must be 80 +0 46 
applied to the readings a typical hydrometer correction chart is 82 +0 54 
shown in table 8 high accuracy and low cost are the major 84 +0 62 
advantages of brix hydrometers some winemakers avoid 86 +0 71 
temperature corrections by making sure the temperature of the 88 +0 80 
grapes and the hydrometer is at the calibration temperature 

table 8 temperature
grape samples are brought into the winery lab and allowed to 
corrections for brix 
come to temperature equilibrium when the grapes have cooled 

hydrometers 
to room temperature the grapes and hydrometer are at or close to the calibration temperature and corrections are not needed 
taking sugar samples 
making accurate sugar measurements in large vineyards is not easy the grapes from a single cluster contain different amounts of sugar grapes 
from high on the cluster normally contain more sugar than grapes from the bottom of the cluster grapes taken from clusters exposed 
to the sun contain more sugar than grapes taken from clusters growing in heavy shade grapes taken from vines growing in different parts 
of a vineyard can have large differences in sugar content variations of two degrees brix often occurs over a ten acre vineyard block 
because of the large variations in sugar content large size samples must be collected to produce accurate results samples of about 
100 individual berries are considered the minimum size for small vineyards and many winemakers prefer 200 to 1000 berries 
besides a large sample size measurement accuracy also depends on how sample grapes are collected the grapes must be collected in a consistent way from the area to be 
picked or the results will be misleading for example an adequate uniform and reasonable size sample could be collected by picking one grape from each vine in a 100 
vine vineyard in a tiny vineyard of 30 vines picking one grape from three or four clusters on each vine would be appropriate a much larger sample would be picked in 
vineyards containing several thousand vines here a uniform sample of several hundred grapes would be collected by picking one grape from every fourth or fifth vine 
collecting a representative sample of grapes from the area to be picked is very important if the intent is to pick the first six rows in a 
block of vines then only first six rows should be sampled if the whole vineyard will be picked then the entire vineyard should be sampled 
collection procedure 
the following grape collection procedure has been used for some time this method produces good results and the procedure is particularly useful when several different vineyard blocks are sampled on the same day 
1 a 1 quart size heavy weight zip seal baggy is used to collect the grapes the date and the vineyard block being sampled can be written on the baggy with a magic marker 
2 grapes can be collected from each vine every other vine every fifth vine etc but at least 100 grapes should be collected from the vineyard block of interest 
3 most of the sample grapes should be picked from the bottom of the clusters watch out for bees and wasps and most of the sample grapes should be picked from clusters growing in the heavy shade 
4 the baggy should be sealed and the grapes kept cool until the measurements have been made 
sugar measurement procedure 
the measurement procedure described below assumes the sugar content is being measured with a short range hydrometer however once the juice has been collected at the end of step three the sugar could be measured with a refractometer 
1 remove any air from the baggy seal the baggy tightly and lay it on a smooth flat surface use a heavy flat bottomed glass tumbler to crush the grapes 
in the baggy gently crush all the grapes but be careful not to press too hard because the seeds can puncture the baggy and cause messy leaks 
2 use both hands and knead the mass of grapes in the baggy for several seconds to extract the juice 
3 unseal the baggy and hold the lip of the baggy over a hydrometer cylinder with the left hand 
and carefully squeeze the juice out of the baggy with the right hand with a little practice the seeds skins and pulp can be retained in the baggy 
4 when the cylinder is about half full of juice lower the hydrometer into the cylinder 
5 add more juice until the hydrometer is floating at a convenient height 
6 wait a minute to let the hydrometer settle then tap the cylinder a few times to make sure the hydrometer is not stuck to the side of the cylinder 
7 read the hydrometer scale at the bottom of the meniscus and record the brix value 
8 remove the hydrometer from the sample and measure the temperature of the juice with a thermometer 
9 use a hydrometer temperature correction chart see table 8 and apply the appropriate correction to the measured value 

summary 
high quality wine can only be made from high quality grapes and grapes are in prime condition for just a few days picking wine grapes near optimum ripeness is very important so winemakers 
start sampling the grapes well before harvest time large size samples are collected and a variety of measurements are used to decide when to pick the grapes each crush season 
sugar content is the traditional way of judging grape ripeness but winemakers also measure acidity and ph 
in addition winemakers also carefully smell and taste the flavor characteristics of the sample juice each winemaker has his or her way of 
noting and recording grape flavor attributes and experienced winemakers make his or her picking decisions based on many different factors

grape processing 
beginning winemakers often view crushing and pressing as the most important parts of winemaking however these operations are only simple mechanical operations machines 
do the crushing and the pressing and if the machines are designed and operated properly the mechanical operations have little influence on the quality 
of the wine quality depends on many factors such as where the grapes were grown when the grapes were picked the acidity and the ph of the juice fermentation 
temperature skin contact time and other parameters wine quality is far more elusive than just being careful how the grapes are mashed and squeezed 
oxidation and biological changes start when the grapes are picked and just a few hours can make a significant difference in hot weather consequently winemakers 
should get to the vineyard early on picking day and they should be prepared to load transport and process the fruit as quickly as possible other problems 
can occur when grapes are picked late in the afternoon on a hot day fermentation temperatures can become excessive easily when warm grapes are fermented 
high temperature fermentations are not conducive to wine quality in addition hot fermentations can kill the yeast and result in stuck fermentations 
commercial wineries cool juice quickly with a heat exchanger and a large refrigeration system home winemakers often let warm fruit sit overnight and cool before crushing either way experienced winemakers try to avoid crushing hot grapes

crushing breaks the skins of the berries an' 'ows the juice to flow crushing should be done with a minimum of grinding 
and tearing of the grape tissues and the seeds should never be cracked or broken destemming is done to remove the fruit 
from the stems stems contain high levels of phenolic materials and these materials contribute bitterness and astringency to wine excessive quantities 
of stems can introduce a green herbaceous characteristic to the wine and practically 
' red grapes should be destemmed before fermentation is started on the other hand removing the stems from white grapes is not necessary when the fruit is pressed immediately 
sometimes not removing stems from white grapes is advantageous 
the pulp of some white grape varieties is very slippery and the slick pulp makes these varieties difficult to press varieties like muscat alexandria have slick 
pulp and they are much easier to press if the stems are left in the must hand crushing red grapes 
crushing a sm' quantity of red grapes by hand is easy but wine yields will be low unless a good wine press is used to separate the new wine from the solids at the end of fermentation several hand crushing 
techniques have been developed and most of these procedures are satisfactory for handling sm' quantities the following procedure is simple and it can be used for quantities of 200 or 300 pounds 
1 place a clean plastic milk crate on a new 32 gallon plastic trash can or any other suitable ridged container 
2 place several pounds of grapes in the crate smash the clusters with a board or with both hands 
3 use a wash board scrubbing motion with one hand the grapes and juice will fall through the bottom of the crate into the container and the stems will remain in the crate 
4 remove the bare stems from the crate 
5 repeat this procedure 

not all of the grapes will be crushed but unbroken berries will not cause problems when the fermentation is pressed the wine press will break the skins of the whole berries and most of the juice will be recovered 
in fact some winemakers deliberately leave some whole berries in their fermentations these winemakers feel the presence of whole grapes during fermentation increases the fruitiness of the finished wine 
the stems of some grape varieties are abrasive and the above procedure can be hard on the hands after an hour or two fingers can become 
raw and hands become badly stained a pair of heavy rubber gloves may be desirable when large quantities of fruit are crushed by hand 
crushing by foot 
crushing grapes with bare feet is a popular notion but bare feet are not very practical grapes stain bare feet black not red grape tannin can cause bare feet to become 
very dry and the skin around the toes sometimes cracks some varieties of grapes have stiff sharp stems and these stems can be uncomfortable to tender bare feet 
crushing several hundred pounds of red grapes by foot is quite feasible but instead of bare feet an old pair of well scrubbed rubber boots should be used a shallow 
rigid container of some kind is needed to hold the fruit large plastic mortar boxes are available at large hardware stores and these shallow boxes make 
suitable containers a rhythmic motion should be used when crushing the feet should be kept moving around in the container to make sure the grapes in the corners 
of the container are crushed grapes can be slippery and some kind of hand support will be needed to help maintain balance as the grapes are stomped 
hand crank crushers 
most home winemakers use a hand crank crusher both single and double roller crushers work well although some machines are easier to crank than others these little machines are simple to operate 
place the crusher on top of a suitable container and fill the hopper with fruit turning the crank at a moderate rate pulls the clusters of grapes between the rollers the grape skins are 
broken and the crushed grapes juice and stems drop into the container hand crank crushers should be adjusted to a convenient working height and cranking the crusher will be much easier if 
a clamp is used to hold the machine steady most winemakers crush all of the grapes and then they destem the must a few winemakers do not destem the grapes from some red varieties at all 
crusher/stemmer 
commercial wineries and some advanced home winemakers use a motor driven crusher/stemmer to process the grapes a crusher/stemmer crushes the berries and removes the stems in one easy operation the better designed 
machines have power driven augers to move the fruit along the hopper into the crushing mechanism operation is simple and fast grape clusters are dumped into the hopper and the machine does the rest 
power crushers have capacities ranging from about 1 ton to more than 50 tons per hour even the smallest machines crush and destem large quantities 
of fruit in a short time one person is busy keeping the hopper full of grapes power crushers save a great deal of labor but they are expensive 
small power crushers made of painted steel sell for six or seven hundred dollars the same machine fabricated from stainless steel sells for 
about 1000 justifying the expense of a power crusher is difficult for home winemakers unless several barrels of wine are made each year 
pressing 
the process used to separate the liquid from the grape solids is called pressing squeezing a small amount of juice from white grapes by hand is possible however juice yields will be 
low and a surprising amount of labor is required to squeeze sweet pomace by hand a press of some sort is a practical necessity for making more than a gallon or two of white wine 
pressing red fermentations is a different situation as red grapes ferment alcohol breaks down the cell tissues the partially disintegrated pulp then gives up the juice more readily 
and red pomace is much easier to press than white grapes pressing small red fermentations by hand is relatively easy and reasonable quantities of wine can be recovered 
hand pressing red pomace 
the following hand pressing method is suitable if the grapes were crushed completely 
1 obtain a clean plastic milk crate and then cut a piece of 3/4 inch plywood to fit inside the milk crate the wood should fit loosely 
2 when fermentation is complete let the cap rise overnight and carefully siphon off as much free run wine as possible 
3 place the plastic milk crate on a 32 gallon plastic trash can or other suitable container and put a double layer of plastic window screening in the bottom of the crate 
4 nearly fill the crate with the wet pomace and place the plywood on top press the pomace by hand and then place a heavy weight on the plywood 
5 let the pomace drain for 15 or 20 minutes then stir the pomace and repeat step four 

depending upon the grape variety and the length of the fermentation 60 to 80 percent of the potential wine can be recovered by hand pressing using this method 
basket press 
most home winemakers use a vertical basket press of some kind and some of these presses are designed to produce high pressures high press pressures dry the pomace quickly but high pressures can also produce astringent 
and bitter wines very high press pressures are not desirable and compound ratchet type presses must be used with care the following procedure produces good results when modest press pressures are used 
1 fill the basket with crushed fruit add the top plates the blocks and the press head apply a small amount of pressure until a steady flow of juice is produced 
2 when the flow almost stops increase the pressure by a small amount and wait again large amounts of foam between the basket slats will oxidize the juice and the foam is an indication that pressure is being applied too rapidly 
3 continue increasing the pressure in steps until no more liquid can be obtained 
4 disassemble the press by removing the press head blocks top plates and the basket 
5 remove the pomace cake from the press place the pomace in a shallow container or on a clean concrete floor and crumble the cake with a shovel 
6 replace the basket on the press fill the basket with the pomace reassemble the press and start the next pressing cycle 
depending on the variety of the grapes about 150 gallons of high quality juice can be produced from a ton of grapes using these procedures however the pomace cake must be crumbled several times to 
produce 150 gallons of juice pressing white grapes with a vertical basket press is a lengthy procedure and much labor is required to break down the press and crumble the pomace several times 
labor is expensive so commercial wineries no longer use vertical basket presses instead most wineries use bladder or membrane horizontal 
presses because the machines can crumble the pomace cake automatically consequently many press cycles can be used economically and six 
or more press cycles are often used to dry the pomace completely instead of using high pressures and two or three press cycles modern 
horizontal wine presses use low pressures and many cycles to produce 160 to 180 gallons of high quality juice from a ton of fruit 
must adjustments 
winemakers carefully measure the juice when the grapes are crushed so any needed adjustments can be made before starting fermentation if sulfur dioxide was not added when the grapes were crushed it would be 
added at this time small additions of yeast nutrient would be made to grapes grown in vineyards deficient in nitrogen and tartaric acid would usually be added to fruit grown in warm viticulture regions yea 
sulfur dioxide so2 
sulfur dioxide helps control wild yeast growth and so2 is effective in suppressing several types of bacteria it also helps reduce 
oxidation of the must juice or wine big wineries use large quantities of so2 so they purchase sulfur dioxide gas in steel 
pressure cylinders small wineries and home winemakers generally use potassium metabisulfite sulfite crystals to produce sulfur 
dioxide gas generally 25 to 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes before fermentation 
sulfur dioxide is more effective when it is added early in the process larger wineries have an so2 container and a metering pump 
mounted right on the crusher the sulfur dioxide is automatically dispensed whenever grapes are going through the crusher 
home winemakers usually add a half teaspoon of sulfite crystals for every 100 pounds of grapes the sulfite powder is dissolved 
in a small amount of water and the solution is added to the grapes as they are being crushed a few winemakers do not add 
sulfur dioxide early they feel white wines retain better color and malolactic fermentation is easier to complete when no sulfur 
dioxide is added as the grapes are crushed these winemakers prefer to make the first sulfur dioxide addition later in the 
winemaking cycle however most experts uc davis vinquiry the wine lab etc recommend the addition of small quantities of sulfur 
dioxide early when the fruit is crushed adding sulfur dioxide early is a much safer procedure for beginning winemakers 
yeast nutrients 
many yeast cells are needed to complete fermentation and yeast must have access to nitrogen vitamins minerals and other materials to produce new cells some grape varieties like 
chardonnay often lack sufficient nitrogen to meet the needs of the yeast and chardonnay juice is often difficult to ferment to dryness unless extra nutrients are added 
small wineries and home winemakers seldom have the equipment needed to measure juice nutrients so these winemakers add small quantities of nutrients to all grapes nevertheless 
yeast nutrients must be used with care because excessive quantities can produce off odors in the wine the manufacturers directions should always be followed carefully 
acid 
tartaric malic and citric acids are present in grapes and several other organic acids are present in wine the tart taste of wine is directly related to the quantity of acids present when a wine contains too much or too little acid 
 the wine will be out of balance most grape varieties grown in the interior valleys of california are deficient in acid when fully ripe when grapes lack acidity winemakers often add tartaric acid before starting fermentation 
titratable acidity is a measure of the sum of all the organic acids in juice or wine most winemakers prefer to ferment white juice when the titratable acid is in the 0 7 to 0 9 percent gram/100 milliliters 
range red musts are often adjusted to a titratable acid of about 0 7 percent before fermentation the titratable acid of the fruit is always measured at crush time and any needed acid

carbonate caco3 or potassium 
table 9 tartaric acid additions for deficient juices 
carbonate k2co3 to reduce the acid content of juice or must before fermentation is started these materials precipitate acid salts from the juice and when most of the acid 
in the grapes is tartaric acid substantial acid reductions are possible approximately 3 5 grams of calcium carbonate per gallon of juice will reduce the titratable acid 
by 0 1% these carbonates must be used with caution because large quantities of either material can raise juice ph to excessively high values most winemakers use just enough 
carbonates to raise the ph of the juice to about 3 3 at this ph value ml fermentation can usually be relied on to reduce the acid content to a reasonable level 
ph 
another important acid parameter is ph it gives the winemaker information about just how much sulfur dioxide will be needed to control the wine microorganisms juices with low ph values 2 9 3 3 require little 
sulfur dioxide and medium ph juices 3 4 3 6 require an average dose high ph juices 3 7 4 1 often require a prohibitively large addition of sulfur dioxide to control the wine microbes effectively 
when working with grapes grown in a warm area some winemakers add tartaric acid until the titratable acid is raised to approximately 0 8 percent other winemakers simply ignore the titratable acid content and they add tartaric acid 
until the ph of the juice drops to about 3 4 experienced winemakers taste the juice and measure the titratable acid and ph these winemakers use all of the information available when making pre fermentation acid adjustments 
sugar additions 
when grapes are mature low sugar content is not a problem gapes low in sugar were picked too soon and making high quality wine from immature 
grapes is difficult immature fruit will be high in acid low in flavor and low in varietal flavors and aromas home winemakers are often 
advised to add sugar to immature fruit the additional sugar will increase the alcohol content of the wine but the extra sugar will not 
reduce the acidity increase the flavor or improve the weak varietal characteristics unless the winemaker is interested in producing 
wines high in alcohol adding sugar to underripe grapes is seldom advisable in colder growing regions frost danger sometimes occurs before 
the grapes are completely ripe and growers must pick or lose their crops here adding sugar to the juice until the hydrometer reads 
20 brix or so might result in better quality wine attempting to make a big red wine from such immature fruit is hopeless generally 
underripe red grapes are best used by making blush wine ordinary white table sugar sucrose should be added to the juice or must 
cold settling white juice 
much research has been done on white wine fermentations this work clearly shows that fresher more fruity wines are produced when bits of skin and pulp fragments are removed before fermentation 
removing solid materials from the juice results in slower better controlled fermentations and the wines have less off flavors and off odors treating white juices to reduce the 
amount of suspended material to 1 or 2 percent before fermentation has become a standard winemaking procedure solids can be removed from juices with a centrifuge by filtration or by 
cold settling centrifuges and lees filters are expensive pieces of equipment so smaller wineries and home winemakers generally use a cold settling procedure to clarify white juices 
the procedure is simple immediately after pressing the juice is cooled about 50 degrees so it will not start to ferment the cold 
juice is allowed to settle overnight in a closed container in the morning the clarified juice is racked off the sediment 
and the solid material is discarded only clear juice is fermented when making white or blush wines sometimes additional clear 
juice can be obtained by resettling the lees but the lees must be kept cold or spontaneous fermentation will start 
summary 
crushing is the mechanical operation that breaks the skins of the berries and starts the juice flowing crushing should be done with a minimum of grinding and tearing of the grape tissues grape seeds should 
never be broken pressing is the mechanical operation used to separate the liquid from the solids pressing should be done at low pressures to reduce the extraction of bitter and astringent materials 
twenty five to fifty milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of juice should be added to the grapes as they are crushed juice should be tested and any needed adjustments should be made before fermentation is started 
the quality of all white and blush table wines can be significantly improved by reducing the amount of suspended material to 1 or 
2 percent before fermentation solids can be removed by settling cold juice and then racking the clear juice off the sediment 
making an off dry low alcohol blush wine is often the best way to use underripe red grapes 
chapter 11 

wine yeasts 
the flavor characteristics of wine depend upon many factors however the yeast used for fermentation contributes little to the flavors of aged wine and most flavor contributions from the yeast will be undetectable in wines 
aged in oak barrels for normal periods many other winemaking factors such as fruit quality grape variety the climate fermentation temperature lees contact cap manipulation etc influence wine flavors much more than yeast 
light bodied fruity wines are exceptions these wines are bottled and consumed when they are young and the effects of the yeast 
are still noticeable under these conditions subtle flavor and aroma variations can be produced by different strains of yeast 
yeast characteristics 
large differences in wine yeasts do exist however these differences relate to properties other than creating wine flavors yeast characteristics important to winemakers 
include speed of fermentation color extraction how much alcohol is produced tendencies to stick the quantity of foam generated hydrogen sulfide production etc 
a few wineries use a different type of yeast for each wine produced many smaller wineries ferment all of their wines with only one or two types of yeast the research winery at the university 
of california at davis uses a single yeast type for all standard fermentations smaller wineries and home winemakers often use prise de mousse yeast for all their fermentations 
yeast names often mislead and confuse novice winemakers for example pasteur champagne yeast is not very good for sparkling wine production california champagne or prise de mousse are better yeasts for 
the secondary fermentation of sparkling wines instead of implying use the name shows the yeast strain originally came from the champagne district of france to complicate matters further the same 
name is sometimes used by different yeast manufacturers to identify completely different yeast strains a few years age two entirely different yeast strains of yeast were available commercially and 
both were called prise de mousse when placing orders for yeast winemakers can avoid confusion by providing the name of the yeast the name of the manufacturer and the yeast designation number 
yeast types 
wine yeast can be purchased in both liquid and dry forms however dry yeast is easier for small wineries and home winemakers to use recommended 
applications of some popular dry lalvin yeasts are shown in figure 3 and some important yeast characteristics are shown in figure 4 
epernay ii 
this is a popular yeast for producing light fruity style white and blush wines and epernay is also popular for producing wines made from fruit other than grapes sometimes epernay is used for 
 producing light fruity style chardonnay wines however chardonnay juice can be difficult to ferment completely and stuck fermentation often results when epernay yeast is used with chardonnay

chardonnay wines fermented with epernay yeast should be closely monitored and tested for residual sugar 
epernay is used at fermentation temperatures ranging from 50 to 70 degrees under these conditions it produces slow controlled fermentations and volatile components in the juice are retained well 
excessive foaming is seldom a problem when epernay is used epernay does not ferment well at low temperatures and it is very sensitive to sudden changes in fermentation temperature cold shock 
epernay is often used when winemakers intend to leave some residual sugar in a wine usually active epernay fermentations can often be stopped just by lowering

the temperature of the tank 
epernay yeast is sensitive to high alcohol levels consequently epernay should not be used in juices with high brix values unless some residual sugar is 
wanted epernay yeast can produce very pleasant fruity aroma characteristics 
in young wines and home winemakers use epernay yeast for fermenting fruit wines because of the fruity aromas produced this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk form 
california champagne ucd 505 
this yeast is used primarily for the secondary fermentation of sparkling wines it produces a simple clean yeasty fermentation and these characteristics are desirable in most 
sparklers after a reasonable aging period ucd 505 yeast will flocculate into large clumps and the large pieces of yeast are much easier to riddle ucd 505 yeast is sensitive 
to alcohol and sulfur dioxide to insure prompt clean secondary fermentations the free so2 level of the cuvje should not exceed about 25 milligrams per liter and the alcohol 
content should be less than 11 percent small quantities of yeast nutrient are often used with this yeast ucd 505 is available only in 500 gram packages and in bulk 
montrachet ucd 522 
montrachet was a very popular yeast for producing well colored red wines and big white wines for many years montrachet produces strong vigorous fermentations 
and some type of cooling is often necessary in warm weather 
unfortunately montrachet yeast often produces excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide and it has fallen into disfavor in recent 
years grapes low in nitrogen should always be augmented with a yeast nutrient or dap when montrachet yeast is used and prudent 
winemakers make it a point to smell all montrachet fermentations several times each day montrachet yeast should never be used 
with grapes containing residual sulfur dust this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk 
pasteur champagne ucd 595 
contrary to its name pasteur champagne yeast is not well suited for sparkling wine secondary fermentations it can be used for sparkling wines but ucd 595 produces very fine lees and the 
light fluffy lees make riddling difficult pasteur champagne yeast is tolerant of high alcohol levels and sulfur dioxide so it is often used to restart stuck fermentations some wineries 
use this yeast for both white and red fermentations and it can be counted on to produce clean neutral fermentations when used under reasonable fermentation conditions it seldom leaves 
residual sugar sometimes pasteur champagne yeast produces large quantities of foam in warm weather this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk 
prise de mousse e c 1118 
since it became available in dry form several years ago the popularity of prise de mousse pdm yeast has increased rapidly pdm is an excellent 
general purpose yeast for both red and white wines it produces low hydrogen  f/p code disconnect  2.1.  3.  4.  4.1.  4.2.  4.3.  4.4.  5. 
sulfide fermentations and it ferments vigorously since this yeast usually produces a dry wine it is one of the more popular yeasts for california 
chardonnay production this yeast is tolerant to sulfur dioxide and 
it is tolerant to high alcohol levels consequently prise de mousse is useful for restarting stuck fermentations prise de mousse is also used for the 
secondary fermentation of sparkling wine under normal condition prise 
de mousse produces little foam and seldom causes the winemaker any trouble smaller wineries often use this yeast for all their fermentations pdm is 
available in five gram envelopes 500 gram packages and in bulk 
steinberg 
steinberg yeast is used for producing classical cold fermented riesling wines and it is used extensively for gewurztraminer production when used at low fermentation temperatures steinberg produces 
a delicate complex bouquet of fruit odors in young white wines this yeast is very cold tolerant and it often continues fermenting at temperatures below 40 degrees however this yeast 
is very sensitive to sulfur dioxide and steinberg fermentations can be retarded significantly if more than 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added at the crusher sometimes winemakers 
can deliberately stop low temperature steinberg fermentations just by adding a large dose of sulfur dioxide to the tank this yeast is only available in 500 gram packages and in bulk 
pasteur red 
pasteur red yeast has been available commercially for some time but it has only been produced in dry form for the past several years in dry form pasteur 
red is rapidly becoming the yeast of choice for producing full bodied red wines pasteur red produces clean fermentations and it has good color 
extraction characteristics this yeast seems particularly well suited for fermenting deeply colored bordeaux style red wines pasteur red yeast is vigorous 
and some cooling is often needed in warm weather pasteur red yeast can be purchased in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk form 
summary 
the type of yeast used for fermentation has little influence on the aromas and flavors of aged wines however yeast can contribute to the aroma of young fruity wines 
yeast is available in liquid and dry form but dry yeast is much easier for small producers to store and use 
prise de mousse yeast produces little foam and seldom causes fermentation problems some small wineries use prise de mousse for all of their red and white fermentations and they also use it to restart stuck fermentations

fermentation 
practically all red grapes have clear colorless juice the red pigment is in the grape skins red wine is made by fermenting the juice 
pulp and skins together and during fermentation the red color is extracted from the skins after several days of fermentation 
the new red wine is pressed and the liquid is separated from the solids besides color many other materials are extracted 
from the skins during fermentation and these materials produce the slight bitterness and astringency typical of red wine 
white and blush wines are produced differently these wines are made by crushing and then pressing the crushed grapes the liquid is separated from the solids before fermentation is started 
white and blush wines are made by fermenting clear juice almost no skin contact occurs and only small amounts of color bitterness or astringency are extracted from the skins 
white wine can be made from red grapes if the contact between the juice and the skins is limited french champagne is made from pinot noir grapes and 
pinot noir is a red grape white zinfandel and all blush wines are considered white wines because the juice is separated from the solids before 
fermentation rosj wines on the other hand are considered red wines because they are fermented with the juice and the skins in contact for a short 
time winemakers use the terms white and red in two different ways besides describing color these terms also indicate the way wine is fermented 
yeast growth 
wine yeasts are microscopically small single cell organisms like every living organism yeasts need energy to survive and the 
necessary energy is obtained by metabolizing grape sugars ethyl alcohol is produced as an end product but the yeasts do 
not use the alcohol they are only concerned with the energy produced when the sugars are converted into alcohol besides sugar 
yeasts must have access to many other materials to reproduce new cells and yeasts are sensitive to their environments 
the conversion of glucose into alcohol is a complicated multi step biochemical process several different enzymes are needed to convert the sugars 
and yeast must have access to vitamins minerals oxygen nitrogen etc to produce the required enzymes grape juice normally contains all the 
necessary materials but sometimes fermentations lack one or more of these critical growth factors and the yeast cannot convert all of the grape 
sugars into alcohol most stuck fermentations are caused by deficiencies in the starting juice or by excessively high or low temperatures 
oxygen 
yeast reproduces rapidly when sufficient oxygen is available when the environment is optimum yeast populations can double in less than an hour this rapid period of yeast growth is called the exponential growth 
phase and an enormous yeast population 10 million cells per milliliter of juice can develop in less than 24 hours rapid cell growth occurs during the exponential growth phase but little alcohol is produced 
the situation is different when oxygen is restricted with little oxygen yeast cell reproduction is much slower but the yeast produces larger amounts of ethyl alcohol 
from the winemakers point of view having oxygen available early in the fermentation process is always desirable yeast cells then multiply rapidly and a large yeast population is produced quickly later in the fermentation 
oxygen is deliberately restricted to promote alcohol production this simple technique allows winemakers to encourage early yeast growth and the large yeast population will convert the grape sugars in a dependable way 
a lack of oxygen is seldom a problem when wine is fermented under typical home winemaking conditions the quantity of oxygen needed by the yeast 
is small and more than enough oxygen is introduced when grapes are subjected to the normal winemaking processes of crushing and pressing 
nitrogen 
yeast must have protein to make new cells and yeast must have nitrogen to produce the protein normally grapes contain enough nitrogen to meet the yeasts needs however 
vineyards needing fertilization often produce fruit excessively low in nitrogen content and then the yeast has problems producing the large numbers of 
cells needed to complete fermentation winemakers often add small quantities of diammonium phosphate or other sources of nitrogen to juices low in nitrogen the 
diammonium phosphate gives yeast the nitrogen needed to produce new cells and complete the task of fermentation the yeast and the winemaker are then happy 
sometimes a problem develops when nitrogen is added near the end of fermentation a significant amount of alcohol has accumulated by this time the alcohol seems to prevent the intake of nitrogen by the yeast cells and sometimes 
the fermentation sticks to avoid this problem winemakers monitor their fermentations carefully and correct any nitrogen deficiencies early in the fermentation cycle before large amounts of alcohol accumulate 
micro nutrients 
yeasts also need an assortment of vitamins minerals and other growth factors yeasts require very small quantities of these substances so winemakers 
often call these materials micro nutrients normally grapes contain adequate quantities of these micro nutrients but some vineyards consistently 
produce grapes deficient in some particular growth factor in these cases winemakers try to avoid fermentation problems by adding a complete yeast 
food to the juice several commercial products such as superfood are produced specifically to supply yeast with these necessary micro nutrients 
yeasts often produce excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide when they lack pantothenic acid hydrogen sulfide produces the familiar rotten egg smell and even 
small quantities of hydrogen sulfide can damage wine quality and commercial and home winemakers routinely add minute quantities of pantothenic acid to 
fermentations pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased in any drug store 
handling dry yeast 
dry yeast looks almost indestructible however dry yeast consists of live cells and it must be handled with 
care yeast weakened by mishandling often requires an 
unusually long time to start fermenting and sometimes 
damaged yeast has trouble fermenting the juice to dryness 1 by prolonged storage at 
figure 5 shows several ways yeast can be damaged 2 temperatures above 95 degrees by storage in a freezer 
3 by prolonged exposure to air 
dry yeast will remain viable for at least two years when after the package is opened 
unopened packages are stored in a cool dry place 4 by rehydrating yeast in water 
however once a package has been opened the yeast that is to hot or to cold 
should be used within a few months using open packages 5 by excessive amounts of sulfur 
of dry yeast the next crush season is risky even when the open packages are stored under optimum conditions old 6 dioxide in the juice by juice temperatures either below 60 degrees or above 90 degrees 
dry yeast should be saved it is useful for fining wines 

figure 5 dry yeast can be damaged
containing ethyl acetate 

in several ways 
rehydrating dry yeast 
nine times out of ten satisfactory fermentations can be started just by sprinkling dry yeast on the must to avoid problems the tenth time all yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry 
yeast before it is added to the must yeast rehydration is a simple procedure just add the dry yeast to a small amount of warm water however the temperature of the water is important 
and a thermometer should be used to adjust the water temperature to 100 degrees about one cup of water is needed for a tablespoon of dry yeast stir the yeast mixture until it is 
smooth and then let it rehydrate after 20 to 30 minutes pour the yeast mixture into the must or juice most winemakers use about one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must 
red fermentations 
wine contains phenolic compounds in quantities ranging from 0 03 percent for white wines to about 0 5 percent for red wines although these quantities are small phenolic compounds are among 
the most important wine ingredients because phenolic materials are responsible for wine color some bouquet and flavor components bitterness astringency browning characteristics etc 
extraction 
tannins large condensed polymers and anthocyanins color pigments are the phenolic compounds of greatest interest to winemakers most of the phenolic materials in wine come from the grape 
skins seeds and stems some phenolic compounds are more soluble than others the more soluble compounds are extracted from the grape solids quickly but longer soak times are necessary 
to extract the less soluble phenolic materials other phenolic materials tannins are more soluble in alcohol than in water and these phenolic materials are extracted late in the fermentation 
cycle when the alcohol level is high pigment compounds and some flavor compounds are quite soluble in water and these materials are extracted earlier in the fermentation 
table 10 shows how pigment and tannin compounds accumulate as a function of skin contact time these data were obtained from a typical cabernet sauvignon 
fermentation and the data show four important features 1 more than 90 percent of the total available color was extracted in the first four 
days of the fermentation 2 the color intensity of the liquid started to decrease after about eight days of skin contact time 3 after 20 days of 
skin contact the color dropped to about three fourths of the maximum value 4 tannins continued to accumulate over the entire 30 day interval

soaking is used to produce red wines with a softer more fruity character wines produced this way require less aging and 
table 10 color and tannins are accumulated differently during
these wines can be consumed a few months after bottling 

fermentation 
small producers often use the following procedure to produce 
light fruity red wines 1 sound grapes are crushed and a 
small amount 30 mg/l of sulfur dioxide is added 2 the crushed grapes are placed in a closed container 
and the head space is blanketed with carbon dioxide gas 3 the must is cooled to 50 degrees or lower 

4 the crushed grapes are held at the cold temperature for a time ranging from one to several days 5 the refrigeration is then removed and the crushed 
grapes are allowed to warm 6 when the crushed grapes reach room temperature they are inoculated with yeast and fermented in the usual way 
significant quantities of color and flavors are extracted from the grape solids during the prolonged cold skin contact time however little tannin is extracted during 
the cold soak because the juice contains no alcohol this technique can be used with any grape variety but cold soaking is particularly effective for pinot noir 
fermentations 
fermentation temperature 
red wines are normally fermented at temperatures ranging from 70 to 90 degrees within this temperature range fermentations lasting from four to ten days are typical small wineries and home winemakers often use open fermenters 
and most small red fermentation tanks are not fitted with elaborate temperature control equipment red fermentations can become fast and generate large quantities of heat in warm weather and sometimes winemakers 
get into trouble yeast is sensitive and cannot survive for long when fermentation temperatures exceed 90 degrees consequently small producers watch their fermentations carefully and when necessary they use cold 
water ice or any means available to cool their fermentation tanks red fermenters in large wineries are temperature controlled and fermentation temperatures are established simply by adjusting a thermostat 
cap management 
many small bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed during active fermentation in red fermentations the carbon dioxide bubbles stick to the grape skins and the bubbles make the skins 
more buoyant soon some skins float to the surface of the fermenting liquid and a thick layer of skins pulp and seeds accumulates after a few hours as the layer of skins rises liquid 
slowly drains away and this cap of skins becomes dry a dry cap in an open fermenter creates problems because vinegar bacteria can grow in the cap the vinegar bacteria convert alcohol 
into acetic acid and the acetic acid spoils the wine winemakers prevent this very undesirable condition by breaking up and submerging the cap periodically to keep the skins wet 
caps on small fermentations are not very thick and small caps can be managed easily by stirring the must with a large wood spoon 
two or three times each day in larger fermentations the cap becomes several inches thick and a special tool is needed to push 
the cap back down into the juice most winemakers punch down the cap at least twice a day several studies show more color and 
flavors are extracted when the cap is gently punched down several times a day during the first few days of fermentation 
large wineries ferment red wine in closed stainless steel tanks and they use a technique called pumping over to keep fermentation caps 
wet a powerful pump and a large hose are used liquid is pumped from the bottom of the tank to the top and sprayed over the cap 
early pressing 
the phenolic content of red wine depends on the length of time the liquid is in contact with the grape solids and skin contact time is a common method 
used to control the astringency of red wines the term early pressing is used when red fermentations are pressed before they reach dryness 
and early pressing is a common and effective technique for producing soft fruity red wines skin contact times are short so the tannin content 
is low usually four to seven days of skin contact will produce ample extraction when red wines are fermented at normal temperatures 
winemakers often produce light fruity red wines by pressing the fermentation when the sugar content drops to eight or ten degrees brix however wines pressed too early are often light in structure 
and these wines can lack complexity full bodied red wines are normally pressed when the hydrometer reads zero and some big red wines are kept on the skins for three or four weeks 
sometimes novice winemakers attempt to make a big red wine by using an extra long skin contact time unfortunately such attempts 
usually fail high quality wines can only be made from very high quality grapes and home winemakers seldom have access 
to outstanding fruit more than long skin contact times are required to make exceptional wines skin contact time is always 
something of a compromise there are no fixed rules knowing when to press a red fermentation is part of the winemaking art 
press pressure 
more tannin is extracted from the solids when press pressures are high because of this pressure effect press wine the wine obtained late in the pressing operation contains more 
phenolic material than free run wine the wine obtained before much pressure is applied consequently winemakers also use pressing technique to control red wine astringency 
most home winemakers mix the free run wine and the press wine together but many professional winemakers ferment and age the more astringent press wine separately if the winemaker feels more body and astringency 
are needed the press wine is blended into the main batch later holding press wine separate from the main batch gives these winemakers a simple convenient way to adjust red wine astringency 
white fermentations 
white wines are different from red wines white wines contain less phenolic material than red wines and consumers can tell the difference even when the 
wines are tasted in complete darkness white wines lack the slight bitterness and the astringency of red wines because the phenolic content is lower 
quality red wine can be made with rudimentary equipment but high quality white table wine is much more difficult to make with simple equipment white wine oxidizes easily and the effects of oxidation are more apparent any 
off odors or off tastes are very apparent in white or blush wines more and better winemaking equipment is needed to make high quality white table wine and home winemakers must be prepared to expend more time and effort 
pressing white grapes 
white grapes are more difficult to press than red grapes the pulp of some white varieties is very slippery and slimy and extracting juice from slimy 
pulp is difficult modern wine presses can be programmed to apply low pressures and execute many press cycles automatically the low pressures used 
and the many cycles remove juice efficiently from white pomace without extracting large amounts of astringent materials however most home winemakers 
use small vertical basket presses and separating juice from slippery pulp with a small hand press is a difficult and time consuming job 
cold settling white juice 
cleaner tasting fruitier wines are produced when juice contains less than 2 percent solids so removing solids before fermentation is an important step in producing 
high quality white and blush wines large wineries remove juice solids with a large filter system or with a centrifuge either method requires expensive equipment 
smaller wineries use a simple cold settling procedure to remove the solid materials from their white juices first the juice is cooled to less than 50 degrees 
and the solids are allowed to settle after 12 to 48 hours the clear juice is racked off the residue the juice is then allowed to come to room temperature 
and fermentation is started this is a simple effective procedure but unless the juice is well chilled it will start to ferment when spontaneous fermentation 
starts turbulence is created by the carbon dioxide gas and the turbulence stirs up the juice and prevents the solid material from settling 
fermentation temperature 
fermentation temperature is an important quality factor in white wine production producing high quality white table wine is very 
difficult unless fermentation temperatures can be kept below 60 degrees often novice winemakers do not appreciate the need 
for cold fermentation temperatures and large amounts of poor quality white table wine are made each season because of high 
fermentation temperatures low fermentation temperatures are necessary to retain the fruity characteristics of the grapes 
light fruity white or blush wines like riesling chenin blanc or white zinfandel are produced by fermenting well clarified juice at temperatures ranging from 40 to 55 degrees fermentation is very slow at these low 
temperatures the carbon dioxide gas is produced slowly and the bubbles are small little turbulence is produced and the volatile materials are retained in the juice instead of being blown away by violent bubbling 
steinberg yeast ferments well at low temperatures and it is often used to cold ferment riesling wines prise de mousse yeast also ferments well at 
low temperatures but some types of yeast do not for example epernay yeast seldom ferments to dryness at temperatures much lower than 50 degrees 
sometimes full bodied white table wines like chardonnay or sauvignon blanc are fermented in barrels and malolactic fermentation is often encouraged these wines are often 
aged both in bulk and in the bottle to produce depth and complexity full bodied white wines are usually fermented at temperatures ranging from 55 to 65 degrees 
hydrogen sulfide 
hydrogen sulfide gas h2s produces the familiar rotten egg smell this noxious gas can be produced by yeast during fermentation h2s can also be formed from decaying 
yeast cells when wine is left on gross lees for a long time most people can detect one part per million of this gas so very small quantities of hydrogen sulfide 
can completely spoil a fine wine most often hydrogen sulfide is produced from elemental sulfur during fermentation the sulfur enters the juice as a residue on 
grapes treated with sulfur sprays to control powdery mildew and the sulfur is converted into hydrogen sulfide by the reducing atmosphere of the fermentation 
sometimes hydrogen sulfide is produced by yeast when the grapes contain no residual sulfur here the smell is usually detected near the 
end of fermentation during the later part of fermentation yeast often runs short of some needed material and hydrogen sulfide can 
be produced when yeast does not have enough nitrogen micro nutrients or vitamins hydrogen sulfide is produced when fermentations 
do not contain enough pantothenic acid but hydrogen sulfide can be produced any time yeast is subjected to stressful conditions 
winemakers often add extra nitrogen and micro nutrients to their fermentations specifically to avoid the production of hydrogen sulfide 
gas diammonium phosphate is a commonly used source of nitrogen and proprietary yeast foods are added to provide the yeast a 
variety of micro nutrients adding extra yeast nutrients is a simple and inexpensive way of avoiding problems with stinking fermentations 
unfortunately hydrogen sulfide problems are occasionally encountered even when the best winemaking techniques are used 
removing hydrogen sulfide 
home winemakers often use the following procedure to remove hydrogen sulfide from wine 1 about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide is added to the wine when fermentation is complete 
2 the wine is then aerated by racking with a great deal of splashing and bubbling this treatment converts the hydrogen sulfide back into elemental sulfur and the sulfur settles 
to the bottom of the container sometimes stinky wine needs to be racked two or three times to remove the stench completely 3 after a week or two the wine should be racked or filtered 
to remove the elemental sulfur the smell may reappear unless the sulfur is carefully removed aeration can result in oxidized wine so this procedure must be used carefully 
commercial wineries use copper to remove hydrogen sulfide from their wines a 1 percent solution of copper sulfate is commonly used about 
0 1 milligrams of copper per liter of wine is produced when 150 milliliters of 1 percent copper sulphate pentahydrate solution 
is added to 1000 gallons of wine the copper converts the hydrogen sulfide into copper sulfide copper sulfide is not soluble in wine 
so it settles to the bottom of the tank a few days later the winemaker racks or filters the wine off the copper sulfide residue 
copper is a heavy metal and only very small quantities can be added to wine safely additions often range from 0 05 to 0 2 milligrams of copper per liter of wine mg/l and home winemakers should never add more than 0 
5 mg/l bench testing and careful measurements are required when copper is used little hydrogen sulfide and very little copper will remain in the wine when just the right amount of copper sulfate solution is used 
completing fermentation 
winemakers monitor fermentations carefully to tell if the sugar is being converted at a reasonable rate and to detect any problems early small producers 
measure the temperature and the brix of ongoing fermentations once a day in larger wineries fermentations are usually tested twice a day 
each time the sugar is tested winemakers also check for potential problems by carefully smelling and tasting the sample this close attention allows 
any fermentation problems to be detected early the winemaker can then take prompt corrective action and avoid catastrophic wine failures 
testing for residual sugar 
sometimes novice winemakers have trouble deciding when fermentation is complete fermentation may be complete when the following three conditions are met 1 all bubbling has stopped 2 the brix 
has dropped to less than minus one and 3 the hydrometer readings have remained constant for several days even when all three conditions have been met some sugar can remain in the wine 
consequently most winemakers measure the residual sugar content in all wines shortly after the end of primary fermentation low levels of residual sugar can be quickly and easily measured 
using a clinitest kit these inexpensive kits can be purchased at most large drugstores for just a few dollars use the five drop method and follow the directions supplied carefully 
stuck fermentations 
winemakers use the term stuck when active fermentation stops before all the sugar is gone generally residual sugar in wine is a dangerous and undesirable condition residual sugar in wine represents major 
biological instability because fermentation can restart anytime when fermentation restarts late in the winemaking cycle much of the work done to clarify and stabilize the wine must be repeated then 
more processing is required and the additional handling will not help wine quality sometimes fermentation resumes after a wine is bottled and the yeast produces an unsightly sediment in the bottle the 
wine becomes effervescent and sometimes the bottles explode when the clinitest measurement shows significant sugar remains in wine appropriate steps must be taken to insure future wine stability 
stuck fermentations can be due to a lack of nitrogen the lack of an essential yeast nutrient the use of damaged yeast excessively low or high fermentation 
temperatures etc whatever the causes prompt action is needed and the stuck fermentation should be restarted as quickly as possible 
first a thermometer should be used to make sure the temperature of the stuck fermentation is neither too high nor too low and the stuck fermentation should be racked sometimes racking with a little splashing 
and bubbling will be enough to rejuvenate the yeast and restart a stuck wine if nitrogen deficiency is expected diammonium phosphate should be added to the stuck wine if the fermentation stopped early with 
lots of sugar remaining the additional nitrogen may restart fermentation on the other hand when little sugar remains the stuck fermentation 
should be re inoculated with a fresh batch of alcohol tolerant yeast prise de mousse or pasteur champagne after the nitrogen addition 
more effort is often required to restart stuck fermentations the following method is often successful if the original problem has been corrected 1 make a gallon of starter using either pasteur champagne or 
prise de mousse yeast 2 when the starter is active add a gallon of the stuck wine 3 wait until the starter becomes active again and then add two gallons of stuck wine 4 wait until the starter is active again 
then add four gallons of stuck wine 5 continue this doubling process until all of the stuck wine has been added once active fermentation is underway the wine should be monitored carefully by measuring brix 
twice a day when the hydrometer is steady and reads less than zero the wine should be tested with a clinitest tablet to be sure all the sugar is gone 
excessive acetic acid 
acetic acid is toxic to all strains of saccharomyces wine yeast yeast activity is curtailed and fermentation slows when the acetic acid content of fermenting juice exceeds about 0 1 percent when the acetic 
acid exceeds 0 2 to 0 3 percent few viable yeast cells can be found and fermentation stops 
a subtle fermentation problem can develop in the following way low acid high ph grapes are common in warm growing regions controlling native bacteria with sulfur dioxide is difficult when the ph of the juice 
is high and a large population of lactobacillus bacteria sometimes develops during the primary sugar fermentation the bacteria convert grape sugars directly into acetic acid and the acetic acid content of the 
fermentation becomes excessive under these conditions little or no ethyl acetate is produced and without ethyl acetate the winemaker is often unaware of the problem undetected the lactic bacteria can quickly 
raise the acetic acid level of the juice into the range of 0 1 to 0 4 percent the wine yeasts are unable to tolerate such high concentrations of acetic acid and the unhappy winemaker is left with a 
fermentation high in volatile acid and high in residual sugar this kind of stuck fermentation is almost impossible to restart because of the excessive amounts of acetic acid and the fermentation is often a total loss 
winemakers accustomed to working with low acid grapes avoid this type of lactic bacterial problem by adding tartaric acid before starting fermentation the tartaric acid lowers the ph of the juice and sulfur 
dioxide becomes more effective in controlling the bacteria 
summary 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp and skins together and during fermentation the red color is extracted from the skins fruity red wines can be produced by using several well known winemaking 
techniques such as cold soaking short skin contact times careful cap management and low press pressures 
 white and blush wines are produced by crushing and then pressing the grapes before fermentation is started 
low fermentation temperatures are essential for producing light fruity style white table wines 
a few simple precautions will avoid most fermentation problems active dry yeast should be stored in a cool dry place not in a refrigerator and yeast in packages from packages that have been open for more than 
a few months should be avoided a yeast suitable for the fermentation conditions temperatures and wine style should be chosen and the directions supplied by the manufacturer should always be followed when storing and rehydrating dry yeast 
fermentation progress should be monitored by measuring the brix each day with a hydrometer and by smelling and tasting the juice if fermentation appears sluggish nitrogen should be added before much alcohol has accumulated 
home winemakers remove hydrogen sulfide from wine when fermentation is complete by adding about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide the wine 
is then racked with a great deal of splashing and bubbling commercial wineries use copper sulfate to remove hydrogen sulfide from their wines 
moderate quantities of sulfur dioxide may not control bacteria in high ph juices effectively large populations of lactobacillus 
bacteria sometimes develop during the primary fermentation and produce excessive amounts of acetic acid and kill wine yeast

malolactic

and other fermentations 

webster defines fermentation as a chemical change accompanied by effervescence beginning winemakers often think the transformation 
of sugar into ethyl alcohol is the only fermentation process occurring in wine but many other fermentations are possible 
in wine although the alcohol content and the high acidity makes wine a hostile environment for many microorganisms several yeasts and bacteria can exist and reproduce in wine besides the sugar transforming yeasts other 
microorganisms can convert one or more wine components into new materials the microorganism might use the new material as a growth building block 
or the transformation might be a source of energy for the microorganism the organic acids alcohols and glycerol are 
the wine ingredients most often metabolized by these other microorganisms winemakers call the transformation of grape sugars 
into ethanol by yeast primary fermentation and they usually call the other transformations secondary fermentations 
malolactic fermentation 
most high quality red wines are produced by two distinctly different fermentations first yeast converts the grape sugars into ethanol and 
then bacteria in the wine convert malic acid into lactic acid the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid by bacteria is called 
malolactic ml fermentation and ml fermentation produces significant changes in wine lactic acid is weaker than malic acid so ml fermentation 
reduces wine acidity this reduction in acidity is often used to improve the balance of wines excessively high in acid 
ml fermentation removes unstable malic acid from the wine and when all of the malic acid is gone the wine is more biologically stable small quantities of different 
byproducts are produced during malolactic fermentation and some of these byproducts make positive contributions to the quality and complexity of the wine 
several different types of wine bacteria can convert malic acid into lactic acid these lactic bacteria consist of both cocci round and bacilli rod shaped microorganisms 
the principal bacteria responsible for ml fermentation in wine belong to the leuconostoc pediococcus and lactobacillus genera each genus contains several 
different species so the term malolactic bacteria refers to a group of microorganisms when wine undergoes spontaneous ml fermentation several different kinds of 
bacteria may be involved and these different microbes react in the wine in different ways depending upon conditions the microbes produce a variety of byproducts 
diacetyl 
diacetyl is one of several materials produced by ml bacteria diacetyl has an odor much like butter and diacetyl in wine can modify aroma characteristics significantly generally changes in wine aromas 
are subtle but some wines like chardonnay are often enhanced by very small quantities of diacetyl experienced winemakers produce specific wine styles by skillfully managing ml fermentation 
diacetyl is produced and metabolized by both ml bacteria and yeast when ml fermentation occurs during primary fermentation 
or while wine is aging on active yeast lees most of the diacetyl produced is metabolized by the yeast and little diacetyl 
remains in the wine a similar situation occurs when ml bacteria are allowed to remain in the wine after malolactic fermentation 
has been completed here the bacteria consume the diacetyl and after a few weeks little diacetyl remains in the wine 
sometimes winemakers leave larger amounts of diacetyl in the wine to produce the buttery characteristics so typical of a full bodied chardonnay when a winemaker wishes to leave larger quantities 
of diacetyl in the wine he uses the following strategy 1 when primary fermentation is complete and much of the yeast has settled the wine is racked off the gross lees 2 the 
wine is inoculated with ml bacteria 3 the ml fermentation is carefully monitored at least once each week 4 when ml fermentation is complete the winemaker adds about 50 milligrams per 
liter of sulfur dioxide to the wine and the sulfur dioxide kills the ml bacteria before they can metabolize the diacetyl considerable diacetyl can be left a wine using this technique 
at other times the winemaker may choose to leave little diacetyl in his wine here he uses a different strategy 1 the wine is inoculated with malolactic bacteria either during or 
just after the alcohol fermentation when many viable yeast cells are present in the wine 2 when ml fermentation is complete both the yeast lees and the bacteria are allowed 
to remain in the wine for several weeks before any sulfur dioxide is added during this time the yeast and the bacteria consume much of the diacetyl 3 when most of the diacetyl 
is gone the winemaker adds about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to kill the bacteria the winemaker uses standard winemaking procedures to clean up the wine 
encouraging ml fermentation 
often winemakers wish to encourage ml fermentation even when diacetyl is not wanted red wines high in acid benefit from ml fermentation because the total acidity is reduced and the wine 
has a better balance after ml fermentation red wines are more stable when the malic acid is gone and many winemakers do not want to risk ml fermentation after the wine is bottled 
spontaneous malolactic fermentation can be encouraged in several ways 1 only small amounts 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes when they are crushed 2 keeping wine ph 
values greater than 3 2 encourages the bacteria 3 keeping the wine temperature above 60 degrees encourages ml fermentation 4 keeping wine on yeast lees for several weeks can encourage ml fermentation 
winemakers often inoculate their wines with malolactic bacteria to promote ml fermentation and pure strains of bacteria are commercially available in both liquid and dry forms leuconostoc oenos are the bacteria most often used 
bacteria and yeast compete for micro nutrients in the juice so ml fermentation is more likely to occur when the bacteria are added early in the sugar fermentation before the yeast has consumed all the micro nutrients 
discouraging ml fermentation 
wines produced from grapes grown in warm areas are often excessively low in acid and these low acid wines may or may not benefit from ml fermentation 
many winemakers feel malolactic fermentation is not suitable for light fruity wines because the bacterial fermentation decreases fruitiness 
the following steps are often taken to discourage ml fermentation 1 nominal amounts 30 50 mg/l of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes when they are crushed 2 when primary fermentation is complete 
the free so2 level is raised to about 30 milligrams per liter 3 the wine is racked off the yeast lees promptly and the wine is clarified quickly 4 keeping wine cold discourages ml bacteria 
wine stability 
the presence of malic acid in any wine represents a potential stability problem when wine contains malic acid ml fermentation can occur 
anytime and when ml fermentation occurs after wine has been bottled the results are often disastrous ml fermentation in the bottle 
results in bottle deposits off odors bad tastes and effervescent wine any red wine containing malic acid cannot be considered biologically 
stable so commercial winemakers take specific steps to improve long term wine stability before these wines are bottled 
commercial red wines containing malic acid are passed through a membrane filter at bottling time these wines are often perfectly clear and the filtration is not done to improve their appearance 
the filtration is done to remove the ml bacteria from the wine and sterile filtration is an effective means of preventing ml fermentation in the bottle fumaric acid can also be used 
to prevent ml fermentation in bottled wine and before effective sterile filters were available winemakers often added about 500 milligrams of fumaric acid per liter to their red wines 
just before bottling most home winemakers do not have sterile filtration equipment and many home winemakers continue to use fumaric acid to inhibit ml fermentation in bottled red wine 
other fermentations 
most other secondary fermentations have a detrimental influence on wine quality some secondary fermentations produce subtle changes in wine characteristics but other fermentations often produce gross wine spoilage the changes 
depend upon when the fermentations occur in the winemaking cycle on conditions and on the types of byproducts produced several common wine microorganisms and some problems produced by these microbes are discussed below 
lactic souring 
spontaneous malolactic fermentation is a common red winemaking phenomena however several different kinds of ml bacteria exist and different types of bacteria produce 
different byproducts in wine unfortunately many byproducts produced by malolactic bacteria other than ml fermentation are detrimental to wine quality 
the french enologist emile peynaud gives several rules for making red wine in his excellent book knowing and making wine one of his cardinal rules is make sure the sugars are fermented by yeast 
and the malic acid is fermented by bacteria this is sage advice because most types of lactic bacteria can and will ferment sugar when lactic bacteria attack grape sugars the glucose 
is converted into lactic acid and acetic acid and the fructose can be converted into a nasty material called mannitol when lactic bacteria ferment sugar the volatile acidity of the infected 
wine can increase rapidly and the wine often takes on a characteristic sweet sour taste this type of bacterial spoilage occurs most often when wines have an excessively high ph 
lactic souring and vinegar formation are quite different lactic bacteria produce acetic acid by fermenting the sugar unlike acetobacter lactic bacteria produce little ethyl acetate 
and large amounts of air are not required sometimes this type of spoilage is difficult to diagnose because the wine often has a good bouquet and the flavor may be good however 
a hot burning characteristic is always present in the aftertaste a lingering hotness in a wine always suggests excessive acetic acid and sweet sour tastes sometimes occur when 
considerable sugar remains in the wine lactic bacteria are probably the culprits rather than acetobacter when wine contains excessive acetic acid and little ethyl acetate 
controlling bacteria early in the fermentation is important because some types of lactic bacteria prefer sugar to malic acid most experts 
recommend treating grapes with 30 milligrams per liter of so2 at the crusher even if ml fermentation will be encouraged later 
in the winemaking process even at this low level the sulfur dioxide is effective in limiting early bacterial growth after a few days 
of fermentation the sulfur dioxide level in the wine will be very low and it will no longer inhibit the desired ml fermentation 
residual sugar & lactic bacteria 
stuck fermentations often occur in the following way first a neglected red fermentation overheats and the high temperature kills the yeast fermentation 
abruptly stops and considerable sugar remains in the wine the wine is warm and the wine contains sugar in this condition wine is 
extremely vulnerable some lactic bacteria are always in wine and when the wine is in this condition these bacteria often attack the remaining 
sugar the wine is warm and large amounts of acetic acid can be produced quickly a wine can spoil in a short time under these condition 
lactic souring is the great danger always associated with stuck fermentations and any significant amount of residual sugar places the wine in jeopardy consequently stuck fermentations should be restarted promptly 
before lactic bacteria can multiply to excessive levels this is why some winemakers prefer to inoculate with ml bacteria late in the alcohol fermentation when very little sugar remains in the wine 
restarting a stuck fermentation of this kind can be very difficult large amounts of acetic acid are in the wine and acetic acid is toxic to wine yeast large wineries remove the acetic acid 
by using a special reverse osmosis process when the excess acetic acid is gone new yeast is added to restart fermentation but reverse osmosis is a complicated process and applying it 
to small quantities of wine is seldom feasible small wineries and home winemakers deal with lactic souring problems primarily by prevention this is one reason 30 to 50 milligrams per liter 
of sulfur dioxide should be added when the grapes are crushed then tartaric acid is added to the crushed grapes and the ph is lower to less than 3 5 before fermentation is started 
acetaldehyde production 
candida mycoderma can oxidize ethyl alcohol in the wine into a very volatile liquid called acetaldehyde in small quantities acetaldehyde gives wine a distinctive nut like aroma 
acetaldehyde is the material that gives sherry its distinctive characteristics although the nutty quality is highly desirable in sherry excessive quantities of acetaldehyde 
give table wine a tired oxidized quality that most people do not appreciate like vinegar bacteria candida mycoderma needs large amounts of air this yeast is often 
seen as a thin patchy film floating on the surface of wine so winemakers call candida mycoderma film yeast fortunately film yeast is sensitive to sulfur dioxide 
the following is an effective treatment for wine infected with film yeast mix an appropriate quantity of sulfite crystals in a small amount of water then pour 
the sulfite solution onto the top surface of the wine pour carefully so mixing of the sulfur dioxide solution and the wine is reduced and a large amount 
of sulfur dioxide is concentrated at the surface since the bacteria are growing on or near the surface this is a potent treatment such dramatic treatments 
are seldom needed if the sulfur dioxide is maintained at reasonable levels and the wine containers are kept completely full and tightly sealed 
glycerol fermentation 
under certain conditions some types of lactic bacteria ferment glycerol in the wine into lactic and acetic acids small amounts of acrolein are also produced during glycerol fermentation 
the infected wine increases in volatile acidity and the wine takes on an unpleasant bitter taste this type of glycerol fermentation occurs most often in wines low in acid and with 
high values of ph glycerol fermentation is also more common in wine made from heavy press fractions or wines made from moldy grapes glycerol fermentation is not very common today because 
adjusting wine ph to 3 5 or less and maintaining 30 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine usually provides adequate protection against this type of wine infection 
tourne 
tartaric is one of the more stable organic acids however a few species of lactic bacteria can ferment tartaric acid into lactic acid acetic acid and carbon dioxide gas when tartaric acid is fermented the 
fixed acidity of wine decreases and the volatile acidity of wine increases the wine takes on a strange dull appearance and the color turns brown a strong and disagreeable mousy odor often develops 
the french name for this unfortunate wine condition is tourne and when the disease is advanced the wine becomes undrinkable tourne is a gross transformation and this sickness is more prevalent in wines 
having high ph values fortunately these bacteria are very sensitive to sulfur dioxide and maintaining reasonable levels of molecular sulfur dioxide in wine will prevent the development of tourne 
vinegar formation 
vinegar bacteria acetobacter are found in the vineyard on the grapes in the cellar on the equipment in the wood of used wine barrels and in the wine acetobacter is the bug that converts ethyl alcohol into acetic 
acid vinegar sometimes very small amounts of acetic acid in a red wine make a positive contribution to the aroma but when acetic acid exceeds about 0 04 percent it produces a burning aftertaste that quickly 
decreases wine quality in a warm cellar and with sufficient air present acetification can progress rapidly and fine wine can be spoiled in a short time along with the acetic acid vinegar bacteria also produce 
ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate has a strong aromatic smell like finger nail polish remover this odor is easy to identify and the smallest hint of ethyl acetate suggests acetobacter activity in a wine 
vinegar bacteria must have access to large quantities of air to oxidize the alcohol into acetic acid colonies of bacteria often develop as thick wrinkled 
mats on the surface of the wine where they have direct access to the air however vinegar bacteria can and do exist in the bulk of the wine barrels 
infected with vinegar bacteria should be taken out of service because disinfecting materials like wood is nearly impossible acetobacter activity is controlled 
by keeping the sulfur dioxide content of the wine at a reasonable level and by keeping wine containers completely full and tightly sealed 
summary 
besides the primary alcoholic fermentation several other microbial transformations often occur in wine malolactic fermentation reduces wine acidity and improves the long term stability of red wine ml fermentation produces the butter 
like quality prevalent in heavier style chardonnay wines and it adds pleasing complexity to red wines ml fermentation is generally encouraged in red wines because red wine containing malic acid is biologically unstable 
besides yeast many other microorganisms exist in wine these organisms can ferment normal wine components into significantly different materials and the products of some of these other fermentations can reduce wine quality 
when winemakers are aware of the microorganisms present they can take effective measures to prevent spoilage most types of bacteria are sensitive to small quantities of sulfur dioxide and many 
bacterial problems can be avoided by maintaining 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free so2 in the wine wine bacteria can also be controlled by other simple techniques adding tartaric 
acid to decrease wine ph and maintaining the wine at low temperatures are both effective control techniques keeping wine containers full and excluding air is usually all that is necessary 
to control vinegar bacteria winemakers often use sterile filtration to remove bugs from wine mechanically and under adverse condition pasteurization is sometimes necessary

fining and fining materials 
fining materials are used for the specific purpose of removing something from wine a wine might be fined to remove unwanted color 
haze bitterness excessive astringency off flavors unpleasant odors etc usually the fining agent itself is eliminated before 
the wine is bottled wine has been made for thousands of years and over that lengthy period many different materials have been 
used as wine fining agents each fining material has different characteristics so each material must be evaluated carefully 
sometimes two or more fining materials are needed to solve a single wine defect at other times the winemaker might be lucky and discover that a single fining 
agent can eliminate multiple wine problems for example a dark murky blush wine might be fined with bentonite a single application of bentonite might 
1 remove excessive protein and make the wine hot stable the bentonite fining might also 2 improve the clarity of the young wine and 3 remove a small amount of the excess color 
using fining materials 
sometimes novice winemakers attempt to clear dull cloudy wines by filtration but these attempts can be frustrating and expensive polysaccharide 
gums yeast cells and some types of bacteria clog filter media very quickly and the unfortunate winemaker spends much 
time and expense changing filter pads using a fining material to clean up the wine is often a better approach several days after 
fining the wine is racked to eliminate most of the lees and then the wine can be filtered easily when it is reasonably clean 
bench testing 
bench tests are done on individual wines to decide which fining agent is the best material for the job bench tests are also used to learn how much fining material is needed 
tests are made by adding a carefully measured quantity of 
the proposed fining material to a small quantity of wine winemakers make several test samples and each sample contains a different quantity of the fining material after an appropriate time the winemaker examines the samples to 
see which quantity of fining material produced the desired results bench testing is a quick and convenient way for winemakers to try several different fining materials or different dose 
levels many winemakers use clear 750 milliliter 
wine bottles for bench testing however small wine samples require very small quantities of fining materials so precise measurements are necessary an accurate scale and good procedures are needed for meaningful results 
importance of dispersion 
all fining materials must be evenly dispersed throughout the volume of the wine many fining agents are dry powders and these materials must be mixed with a small amount of water 
or wine before being added to the wine most fining materials should be added slowly and thoroughly stirred into the wine a long handled spoon is satisfactory for mixing a 
fining agent into a few gallons of wine a motor driven propeller type mixer is more appropriate for larger containers such as barrels or small tanks many small wineries do not 
have mixing tanks so they often add fining materials when the wine is being racked from one tank into another the circulation produced by the pump provides adequate mixing 
multiple fining sequence 
sometimes a new wine will have several recognizable defects and it will be obvious to the winemaker that multiple fining treatments 
are needed when no other considerations exist fining operations should be done in the following sequence 1 cold stabilize the wine 
chilling also helps clean up the wine and chilling also reduces the microbe population 2 treat hydrogen sulfide problems with copper 
sulfate 3 use protein fining materials gelatin casein isinglass egg whites etc to treat astringency clarity or color problems 
4 fine with bentonite to remove protein and hot stabilize white and blush wines the bentonite fining will help remove any left over protein 
material and it will also improve wine clarity sometimes klearmore sparkolloid or kieselsol are used to compact bentonite lees 
wineries often depart from the sequence given above to reduce handling they fine their white and blush wines with bentonite and then immediately cold stabilize the wine during cold stabilization 
the soft bentonite lees are compacted by the tartrate crystals and the compacted lees make racking easier white and blush wines will usually require some kind of treatment to improve clarity 
and sparkolloid is the fining material of choice for this purpose however getting white and blush wines completely clear and bright without using some kind of filtration is difficult on 
the other hand most red wines do not require extensive fining treatments these wines are often given a light protein fining racked a couple of times during bulk aging and then bottled 
partial fining 
removing unwanted material without removing other desirable wine components may not be possible and compromise is often required for example a delicate white table wine might have a slight bitterness 
in the aftertaste fining with a protein material might eliminate the bitterness but the protein might also remove much of the delicate fruit character this is a poor trade and the winemaker is 
faced with a dilemma sometimes an old german winemaking technique is effective in such circumstances here half the wine is deliberately over fined and half the wine is not fined at all when the 
wine is combined at least half the fruit characteristics are preserved and the bitterness may be reduced by 50 percent often the taste of the resulting product is superior to the original wine 
multiple fining 
sometimes multiple fining applications can effectively reduce wine astringency without devastating wine flavors and aromas for example some winemakers prefer to give tannic red wines 
several light gelatin fining applications during bulk aging instead of one large dose no extra handling is needed if the wine is fined before a regularly scheduled racking 
fining materials 
many materials can be used to fine wine some fining materials are expensive and other materials are difficult to find some fining 
materials are difficult to prepare or special equipment is required metal removing agents contain cyanide compounds and these 
fining materials are dangerous to use a few fining materials like gelatins skim milk and egg whites can be purchased at the 
corner market although many materials can be used to fine wine most winemakers only use a few fining materials routinely 
some characteristics preparation and use of several common wine fining materials are outlined below the characteristics and use of several common wine fining materials are shown

table 11 use and dose levels of common fining materials 
should not be used to 
clarify cloudy wines 
they are not beneficial 
when used in cloudy wines and excessive protein can cause additional problems 
the whites from one to four eggs are the usual quantities used for a barrel 60 gallons of wine this is 
roughly equivalent to to 2 milliliters of egg albumin per gallon of wine a small pinch of table salt should 
be added to a cup or so of warm water the egg white should be separated from the yoke carefully one 

part egg white should be mixed with two parts salt water the mixture should be stirred thoroughly before being added to the wine but the mixture should 
not be beaten to a stiff froth add the egg white mixture to the wine slowly and stir continuously the wine should be racked in a week or so 
bentonite 
bentonite is an extremely fine clay like material it has a negative electrical charge and it is used to remove positively charged particles from wine bentonite is most commonly used to remove 
excess protein from both white and blush wines it is also used for clarification fining of white and blush wines and sometimes bentonite is effective in clearing hazy fruit wines 
a normal dose is 1 to 2 grams of dry bentonite per gallon of wine however it is often used at dose levels that range from to 4 grams per gallon bentonite can strip desirable aromas from wine when used in 
excessive amounts more than 2 grams per gallon so bench testing should always be done bentonite should be mixed with water and allowed to stand for twenty four hours before being adding to the wine 
bentonite can be mixed easily in a blender put the required amount of hot water in the blender turn the blender on and slowly add the dry powder 
when the mixture is cool place it in a refrigerator and allow the bentonite mixture to hydrate for at least 24 hours add the hydrated 
mixture to the wine slowly and stir continuously bentonite is a popular fining material but it has a major disadvantage it produces large 
quantities of lees and the lees are light and fluffy wine is difficult to rack off bentonite lees because the lees are so light 
carbon charcoal 
carbon is fine black lightweight powder used to remove unwanted color and odors from wine although a common commercial fining material finely ground carbon is difficult to handle 
because it flies easily this material can be extremely dirty and sometimes home winemakers have difficulty obtaining carbons in small quantities because of the handling problem 
kbb carbons are acid activated and these carbons are used to remove unwanted color from wine kbb is often used to remove excessive browning from white table wines this material can 
improve the appearance of oxidized white and blush 
wines and it can give these wines a fresher cleaner taste kbb carbon is also used to treat juice from moldy grapes and large quantities of kbb carbon are used to remove excess red color from blanc de noir champagne materials 
aaa carbon is steam activated and it is most useful for removing undesirable odors from wine sometimes aaa carbon is used to remove the nail polish smell produced by ethyl acetate and it is used routinely when 
wines containing hydrogen sulfide rotten egg smell are treated with copper sulfate after the copper treatment a light aaa carbon fining is done to help keep the bad hydrogen sulfide odors from returning 
carbons are used at dose levels ranging from 1/16 to 5 or more grams per gallon of wine but more than a 
gram per gallon can strip desirable color bouquet and flavors carbons must be used carefully and bench testing should be done before any carbon additions are made 
to the main batch sometimes commercial wineries use large quantities of carbon to strip a hopeless white wine completely practically all of the bouquet aromas and 
flavors are removed by the carbon treatment then the stripped wine is blended into a large batch of mediocre wine and a few gallons of muscat are added to the blend 
to improve the nose inexpensive off dry jug wines often contain a portion of stripped wine in the blend obviously the technique does little for wine quality case in 
a half pint of skimmed milk in 5 gallons of wine is a traditional fining treatment for white wine milk contains casein and casein is still a popular fining 
material for white and blush wines casein is a protein and it is used to remove phenolic materials including tannin excessive oak character and some 
bitter flavors from wine sometimes casein is used to remove small amounts of unwanted color from blush wines and it is often used to remove the brownish 
tinge from oxidized white wines casein is very difficult to mix with wine so winemakers prefer to use this material in the form of potassium caseinate 
potassium caseinate solutions are not very effective when stirred directly into wine the casein reacts very quickly with acids 
in the wine and large lumps are formed the lumps of casein do little more than settle to the bottom of the container 
a better method is to inject the casein solution into the wine under pressure large wineries use small high pressure pumps to inject a cloud of tiny casein particles into the wine home 
winemakers often use a large syringe or a rubber bulb 
typical doses range between 0 1 and 1 gram of potassium caseinate per gallon of wine wines fined with excessive quantities of casein can develop a cheesy smell so care is needed 
when using this material bench testing should always be done before the main batch of wine is treated wine should be racked off casein lees after a week or ten days 
gelatin 
gelatin is a popular protein fining material and gelatins are often used to reduce the bitterness and astringency of red wines gelatin removes a quantity of tannin roughly equal to its own weight sometimes white wines have a slightly 
bitter finish and sometimes the bitterness can be reduced by fining with a small quantity of gelatin gelatins are also used to clarify white and blush wines and kieselsol is used to precipitate any excess gelatin residue 
most commercial winemakers prefer to use a high grade more than 100 bloom gelatin but some home winemakers buy gelatin for fining red wines at the local grocery store the grocery 
store product is sold as knox s gelatin and it comes in a box that contains four handy seven gram envelopes read the package carefully and be sure to buy an un flavored gelatin 
gelatin must be dissolved in water before being added to wine gelatin solutions can be prepared by using 1 or 2 grams of gelatin powder for 100 milliliters of warm 
water the gelatin powder should be added to the warm water slowly and much stirring is needed the mixture should stand for a few minutes and then the solution 
should be stirred again until all of the lumps are dissolved gelatin solutions should not be boiled because the heat will denature the protein and render the 
gelatin less effective the gelatin solution should be used while it is warm because it will solidify when cold add the warm gelatin solution to the wine very 
slowly and stir the wine continuously to assure good mixing 
from 1/4 to 2 grams of a dry gelatin per gallon of wine are used to reduce tannins and astringency in red wines doses ranging from 
1/8 to grams of dry gelatin powder per gallon of wine are used to remove bitterness from white and blush wines and from 1/16 to 
1/4 grams of gelatin per gallon of wine are used to clarify white and blush wines gelatin solutions must be used with care small 
doses can strip wines of desirable odors and flavors so bench testing should be done before gelatin is added to the main batch 
isinglass 
isinglass is a protein material made from the air bladders of sturgeon fish the commercial granular form of isinglass is called biofine and this form is much easier to use than the dried sheet material 
isinglass is used to clarify quality white wines some winemakers feel this material can improve wine flavors and aromas small quantities of isinglass are often added to sparkling wines 
to help riddling typical doses of isinglass range from 0 05 to 0 3 grams of dry isinglass per gallon of wine a nominal dose for white table wines is about 0 1 grams per gallon of wine make 
a solution by dissolving isinglass in a small quantity of low ph wine use about 100 milliliters of wine for each gram of granular isinglass and stir this solution into the wine thoroughly 
kieselsol 
kieselsol is a heavy liquid silica colloid nalco 1072 is the material most often used in the u s wine industry this material reacts with protein 
in the wine and precipitates out quickly kieselsol is sometimes used to remove excess protein material from white and blush wines 
kieselsol is often used in combination with gelatins to clarify white and blush wine and gelatin kieselsol fining often produces 
excellent clarification gelatin should be added to the wine first then the kieselsol should be added a day or two later only 
very small quantities of kieselsol are added to the wine so accurate measurements must be made about 1 milliliter of kieselsol 
is required for each gram of the gelatin the wine should be racked off the gelatin kieselsol lees after a week or ten days 
pvpp polyclar at pvpp is sold under the brand name polyclar at it is manufactured in the form of very small round plastic beads pvpp is a light weight plastic similar to nylon 
and this material is completely insoluble in water or wine pvpp is used to remove browning or pinking pigments from white or blush wines it is used 
to remove oxidized odors and for removing small amounts of bitter phenolic compounds pvpp is often used to fine juice pressed from moldy grapes sometimes 
a light fining with polyclar can be very effective and produce almost miraculous results at other times this material may not be very productive 
pvpp is an easy material to use the powder is mixed with a small amount of water and then added to the wine dose levels range from 1/4 to 2 
grams per gallon about 1 gram per gallon is considered a typical dose this material reacts with the wine very quickly so it can be removed 
from the wine after just a few hours however polyclar does not settle out of wine very quickly and many winemakers prefer to filter the wine 
after a pvpp treatment sometimes small amounts of bentonite are used as a topping material to help settle the pvpp particles quickly sparkolloid 
sparkolloid is a proprietary material manufactured by scott laboratories it contains a polysaccharide substance dispersed in diatomaceous earth 
it comes in hot mix and cold mix forms but the hot form is preferred for clarification fining sparkolloid is the material of choice for 
clarifying white and blush wines sparkolloid is one of the more benign fining materials and when used in reasonable quantities it seldom strips 
wine flavors or aromas it is also used as a topping material and sparkolloid can be useful following bentonite or carbon treatment 
sparkolloid does have a significant disadvantage it produces very fine lees and the lees settle out of the wine slowly consequently this material should not be used less than 
30 days before bottling time or small amounts may precipitate later in the bottles many winemakers allow for an eight week settling time just to be on the safe side 
dose levels range from 1/4 to 1 gram of dry sparkolloid powder per gallon of wine about 1 gram per gallon is considered a nominal dose a solution is made by stirring sparkolloid powder into boiling water 
after the powder is added the mixture should be boiled for an additional 20 minutes the sparkolloid solution is not allowed to cool the hot solution should be added to the wine and stirred in carefully 
summary 
fining materials are used to remove a specific material from the wine many different materials are used to fine wine and each material 
 has different properties therefore the winemaker must carefully select each material carefully to produce the desired results 
bench testing is done by treating a small quantity of wine with the proposed fining material after an appropriate time the test wine is examined to verify that the desired 
results have been achieved when the winemaker feels the fining goal has been met in the test sample he adds the correct quantity of the fining material to the main batch 
unsightly protein hazes can form in the bottles unless white and blush wines are hot stabilized bentonite is used to remove excess protein from these wines and all commercial white and blush wines are fined with bentonite 
chapter 15 
clarification and stabilization 

our first impression of any wine is a visual one wine is seen before it is tasted and wine is expected to be brilliantly clear and have an appropriate color the consumer is always disappointed when a wine does not meet these 
visual expectations even zealous wine advocates shy away from turbid dirty looking wines judges at home wine competitions occasionally face this problem and sometimes real courage is needed to taste a particularly ugly wine 
types of hazes 
most wine haze problems are caused by grape particles and fragments microbes protein tartrate phenolic polymers polysaccharide and metals 
wine clarity problems are not mysterious and unless a wine has been grossly contaminated by the addition of some foreign material wine 
haze is normally the result of one or more of these factors sometimes a winemaker will encounter a haze that is particularly difficult 
to remove but these cases are rare most haze problems are solved by identifying the offending material and then acting accordingly 
particles and fragments 
grape particles seldom cause long term haze problems even the smallest bits and pieces of grape pulp and skins are large enough to settle out of wine in a few weeks 
however ml fermentation can produce enough carbon dioxide gas to cause a significant turbulence in a small tank and the turbulence prevents the smaller particles 
from settling out ml fermentation can continue long after the sugar is gone so winemakers check for the presence of carbon dioxide gas to make sure all fermentations 
have been completed when the gas is gone the particles will settle out and after the wine has been racked a time or two it will be clear and bright 
microbial hazes 
yeast cells are several microns in diameter and if the wine is not disturbed the yeast cells readily settle to the bottom of the container in a few weeks usually a little patience will take care of yeast 
haze problems but the situation is not so simple with bacterial hazes bacteria are 10 to 100 times smaller than yeast cells and bacteria are so small they never completely settle out of the wine 
large wineries have sophisticated analytical equipment in their testing labs but even then some types of bacteria are difficult to identify and treat fortunately many wine bacteria are sensitive to sulfur 
dioxide and most bacterial problems can be prevented simply by maintaining the free sulfur dioxide content of stored wine at 30 milligrams per liter once established a bad bacterial haze can be difficult to 
overcome the infected wine can be pasteurized or the wine can be passed through a sterile membrane filter both techniques are effective and both are common wine industry procedures unfortunately few home 
winemakers have the sophisticated and expensive equipment needed to apply either of these treatments since gross bacterial infections are difficult to handle home winemakers should maintain strict hygienic 
winemaking conditions and they should always maintain reasonable amounts 20 to 30 mg/l of free sulfur dioxide in their wines taking these two simple steps will reduce the occurrence of bacterial infections to 
a very low level sometimes home winemakers can rent sterile filtration equipment and sterile filtration might be a feasible way of saving a particularly pleasing wine nevertheless the equipment and 
sterilization procedures are complicated for the average home winemaker prevention is the most effective way of dealing with bacterial problems 
protein 
grapes contain small quantities of protein and some varieties sauvignon blanc sometimes contain large amounts protein is carried over from the grapes into the wine during fermentation originally 
the protein molecules are much too small to be visible in the wine however under certain conditions protein molecules link together polymerize and grow larger after many protein molecules 
have linked together the protein particles are large enough to be visible and the particles are too large to remain suspended in the wine this growth process is very slow at normal cellar temperatures 
but when wine becomes warm the protein molecules grow more rapidly at temperatures of about 120 degrees protein molecules can link together and form large particles in a short time 
a bad protein haze is very unsightly in a bottle of white or blush wine the protein particles are light and fluffy and they produce a swirling cloud when the bottle 
is disturbed when white or blush wines are subjected to warm storage conditions protein hazes can form quickly and all commercial white and blush wines 
are specifically treated to remove the excess protein before bottling winemakers call protein haze hot instability because warm storage conditions trigger 
the phenomena a graphic demonstration of hot instability can be easily produced by leaving a bottle of sauvignon blanc in a car trunk on a hot summer day 
excess protein seldom causes stability problems in red wine red wines contain phenolic compounds that react with the protein during primary fermentation and the excess protein precipitates 
out of the wine white and blush wines contain very little phenolic materials so the winemaker must use a special treatment to remove the excess protein from these wines 
potassium bitartrate 
grapes contain several organic acids including tartaric acid and they contain potassium vines manufacture tartaric acid through the 
photosynthesis process and the vines obtain potassium from the soil potassium reacts with tartaric acid and forms a material 
called potassium bitartrate potassium bitartrate is a clear crystalline material and grapes always contain some of this 
material cooks usually refer to potassium bitartrate as cream of tarter but most winemakers call this material tartrate 
potassium bitartrate has several interesting physical properties 1 only small quantities of this material can be dissolved in grape juice 2 after grape juice ferments and alcohol accumulates even less potassium bitartrate 
is soluble in the water alcohol mixture 3 the quantity of potassium bitartrate dissolved in wine is strongly dependent upon temperature and cold wine cannot hold as much potassium bitartrate as warm wine 
in combination these three properties produce an interesting winemaking problem generally grape juice contains all the potassium bitartrate it can hold when the grapes are picked alcohol begins to accumulate when 
the grapes are fermented as the alcohol concentration increases the new wine becomes saturated and potassium bitartrate precipitates out of the wine as fermentation continues more alcohol is produced and more 
tartrate is forced to precipitate out of wine by the end of fermentation the new wine is over saturated with potassium bitartrate the tartrate continues to drop out of the solution but at normal cellar temperatures 
tartrate precipitation is very slow often the tartrate crystals continue to precipitate for a year or more so potassium bitartrate causes serious long term stability problems for the wine industry 
the following example illustrates a common tartrate stability problem a new white wine is clarified and aged for several months the wine is 
then filtered with a 0 45 micron membrane and bottled the newly bottled wine is clear and bright but the wine is still nearly saturated 
with potassium bitartrate ultimately a consumer puts a bottle of this wine into a refrigerator for a few hours before it is served the 
wine cools rapidly in the refrigerator and potassium bitartrate precipitates out of the cold wine see property number three above 
as tartrate drops out of solution suspicious looking crystals are formed in the bottle or dense hazes form tartrate hazes are very unsightly and sometimes the consumer mistakes 
the tartrate crystals in the bottle for glass particles 
in any case the consumer is unhappy and the winemaker is embarrassed all commercial white and blush wines are cold stabilized sometime during the winemaking process to 
remove the excess tartrate material before the wine is bottled 
phenolic polymers 
phenolic compounds are present in wine in small amounts the quantity may be small but phenolic materials are very important wine ingredients 
phenolic compounds are responsible for color bitterness astringency and some odors and flavors many phenolic compounds polymerize just like 
protein molecules and these phenolic molecules combine and slowly grow larger phenolic molecules carry an electric charge and the molecules 
repel each other in the wine large phenolic molecules can remain suspended in the wine for a long time because of the electric charges 
since phenolic molecules remain suspended for a long time haze and bottle deposit problems often occur a few months after red wines are bottled unless the excess phenolic material is removed to avoid phenolic 
problems experienced winemakers remove excessive quantities of phenolic materials from red wines by fining or filtration any protein fining material such as gelatin casein egg white or isinglass 
can remove phenolic materials from wine and many red wines are lightly fined with egg whites or gelatin several weeks before bottling time the quantity of fining material used is small so the fining 
treatment does not alter other wine characteristics significantly practically all commercial red wines receive a light protein fining or a tight pad filtration to reduce bottle deposits 
making red wines completely phenolic stable is not practical and most red wines will show some bottle deposit when several years old phenolic haze 
problems rarely occur in white or blush wines these wines receive practically no skin contact so they contain very little phenolic material 
polysaccharides 
polysaccharides are very large molecules consisting of many simple sugar molecules monosaccharides linked together pectin and gums 
are common examples of polysaccharides pectin is the material that makes jam and jelly solidify and pectin often produces 
hazes in fruit wines however pectin hazes are seldom a serious problem in wines made from grapes because grapes contain a 
naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down the large pectin molecules into smaller molecules that cause little trouble 
when they do occur pectin or gum hazes can be difficult to remove from wine these large polysaccharide molecules often carry electric charges and 
the charges help hold the molecules in suspension most fining materials used for wine clarification are not very effective in removing this type 
of haze because of the chemical nature of these materials filtration is not always an effective way of removing pectin hazes because filter pads 
are plugged quickly by pectin and gums and trying to filter wine with a bad pectin haze often becomes a frustrating and costly undertaking 
winemakers often use pectic enzymes instead of trying to remove pectin hazes by fining or filtration pectic enzymes are available 
commercially and they are added to the juice or the wine to break down the large troublesome pectin molecules alcohol interferes 
with enzyme action to some extent so sometimes pectic enzymes are more efficient when added to juice before fermentation is started 
occasionally just chilling the wine to a low temperature 28 degrees will cause a bad pectin haze to speed out as if by magic 
metals 
fifty years ago most winemaking equipment was made of iron or brass wine acids are strong enough to dissolve tiny amounts of these metals and in the past 
iron and copper hazes were common problems throughout the wine industry several proprietary fining materials were developed specifically to remove these 
excess metals from wine unfortunately the effective products were based on poisonous cyanide compounds and great care and much testing was required when 
these products were used in recent years the prevalent use of stainless steel and plastic materials has virtually eliminated metal haze problems 
the clarification process 
large quantities of carbon dioxide gas are produced during primary fermentation and considerable turbulence in the wine is produced as the bubbles rise to the surface when fermentation is finished bubbles 
are no longer produced and the wine becomes still when the wine is still gravity slowly pulls the suspended material to the bottom of the container settling time depends on the size of the suspended 
material and smaller particles require more time to settle than larger particles pulp and skin fragments settle out of small containers in just a few days yeast cells are much smaller and a week 
or more is usually required for spent yeast cells to fall 24 inches bacteria are 10 to 100 times smaller than yeast cells and bacteria are so small they never completely settle out of the wine 
new wines contain many different types of suspended particles and these particles often have an electrical charge the charges act just like magnets and 
the like electrical charges repel each other then even larger particles may never settle out of the wine until the electrical charges are neutralized 
racking 
the muck that slowly accumulates on the bottom of wine containers is called lees clean wine is separated from the lees by a decanting process called racking after wine is racked two or 
three times it becomes clean clear and bottle bright besides clarifying wine racking helps remove other unwanted materials so racking also contributes to long term wine stability 
small containers like 5 gallon carboys are usually racked by siphoning the wine off the lees with a piece of clear plastic tubing barrels and drums are often racked with a small 
pump and plastic tubing wineries use powerful electric transfer pumps and large diameter hoses made from food grade materials to rack their large stainless steel wine tanks 
white wines are normally racked off the gross yeast lees shortly after the finish of alcoholic fermentation these wines are 
racked a second time after they have been hot and cold stabilized red wines are often left on their gross lees until 
ml fermentation is finished they are then racked for the first time red wines are usually racked two more times the first year and then at six month intervals most winemakers rack wines 
promptly a week or so after a fining treatment 
fining 
most white and blush wines will be almost clear after being hot stabilized with bentonite but additional clarification steps are usually necessary to produce a bright clear wine 
these additional clarification steps might consist of fining with sparkolloid or gelatin/kieselsol or filtering the wine through a course pad or cartridge commercial wineries 
use large filters to clarify their wines because filtration is safer and quicker when the proper equipment is available small wineries often clean up their wines by fining 
before any filtration is done to reduce production cost most home winemakers do not have filtration capability so they rely solely on fining to clarify their wines 
something is amiss when a white or blush wine does not come clear after being hot stabilized with bentonite and then fined with sparkolloid excessive fining or filtering 
can devastate wine quality so care must be taken when attempting 
to clarify a stubborn wine the first step is to identify the specific problem second appropriate steps should be taken to eliminate the problem and then the wine clarification and stabilization process can be continued 
sound red wines come clear without any fining or filtration treatments because the tannin in red wine acts as a fining agent red wines are usually clear and bright after being racked a couple 
of times and aged a few months although clarity is seldom a problem in red wine long term bottle stability is always an issue red wines generally produce significant amounts of bottle 
deposit unless they are filtered or lightly fined with a protein material light fining or filtration with a medium pad will not significantly alter flavors or bouquets but either procedure 
can effectively reduce bottle deposits the bottle deposits are unsightly so most commercial red wines are stabilized by either fining and/or filtration before they are bottled 
filtration 
today consumers demand brilliantly clear white and blush wines unfortunately maximum wine clarity is difficult to produce by fining alone in addition fining wine is time consuming produces lees and always 
involves some risk consequently filtration plays an important role in the clarification of commercially produced wines pad and frame type filters and cartridge type filters are extensively used throughout the 
wine industry both styles of filters have advantages and disadvantages pad and frame type filters are best suited for filtering large quantities of wine filter pads are inexpensive but the frame assembly is 
very expensive pad and frame filters are best suited for commercial applications because of the large initial capital investment home winemakers often use cartridge type filters because inexpensive plastic 
filter housings are available in most hardware stores filter cartridges are more expensive than filter pads per gallon of wine filtered however since home winemakers produce smaller quantities of wine the 
cost of filter cartridges is not prohibitive both types of filters are discussed in greater detail in the following chapter 
wine stabilization 
wine is often exposed to considerable heat when shipped long distances in the summer time most white and blush wines are chilled to about 
50 degrees for several hours before they are served practically all commercial wines are specifically treated to make them stable and 
after stabilization wine appearance or quality will not be altered by reasonable temperature extremes most commercial winemakers consider 
wine stable if the wine does not show significant changes when exposed to storage temperatures ranging from 40 to 100 degrees 
stabilizing a light fruity white table wine is not trivial light fruity wines can be damaged easily by over processing excessive handling or oxidation 
and producing good long term bottle stability without reducing the quality of a delicate wine requires considerable winemaking skill 
occasionally a winemaker bottles a wine without doing stability tests the wine has been brilliantly clear for several months so 
the winemaker assumes the wine is stable a few weeks after bottling the wine develops a bad haze or drops an ugly sediment in 
the bottles now the winemaker has little recourse because un bottling treating and re bottling would destroy wine quality bottling 
unstable wine can be a discouraging event for any winemaker and it can be an economic disaster for a commercial producer 
cold stabilization 
practically all new wine contains excessive quantities of potassium bitartrate and the tartrate precipitates out of cold wine as crystals or hazes all white and blush wines 
require cold stabilization before bottling and most commercial 
producers cold stabilize their red wines as well wine can be effectively cold stabilized in several ways a few large wineries use ion exchange columns to remove potassium from the wine ion exchange columns are filled 
with resin and work on the same principle as domestic water softeners this type of wine cold stabilization requires large expensive equipment and a trained chemist is needed to establish the proper operation of the exchange 
column however once the equipment is operating the ion exchange method is a fast and economical cold stabilization process unfortunately wine quality can be reduced when the ion exchange method is used inappropriately 
smaller wineries use a much simpler method to stabilize their wines the wine is cooled to about 27 degrees and held at this low temperature for a week or two until the 
excess potassium bitartrate precipitates this method of cold stabilizing wine also has advantages and disadvantages low temperatures are beneficial to new wine 
in several ways besides causing the potassium bitartrate to precipitate the cold temperature helps other unwanted materials settle out of the wine sometimes suspended 
pectin and gums can be removed by chilling the wine in addition several days of low temperature storage can be helpful in developing long term wine stability 
unless the wine is carefully handled considerable oxygen can be absorbed while the wine is cold the oxidation problem can be managed by purging wine containers with an inert gas 
keeping the containers completely full and by maintaining 
adequate levels of sulfur dioxide in the wine the high cost of energy needed to operate the large capacity refrigeration system raises production costs and many wineries use specially insulated tanks to stabilize their wines 
tartrate crystals also form in red wines but the dark color obscures small deposits of tartrate crystals red wines are not chilled before 
serving so a haze seldom forms often the tartrate crystals in red wines are found adhering to the cork and the crystals are removed 
when the cork is pulled tartrate crystals are not so noticeable in red wine so a few smaller wineries and many home winemakers do not 
bother to cold stabilize their red wines however most commercially produced red wines are cold stabilized before being bottled 
hot stabilization 
commercial wine is shipped long distances in warm weather and under these conditions protein instability causes hazes to form in white or blush wine protein hazes are very unsightly and the wine industry considers excess protein 
removal an indispensable treatment for all white and blush wines excess protein is not difficult to remove from most wines but sometimes sauvignon blanc wines can be difficult to stabilize completely without damaging 
aromas and flavors the standard treatment for all new white and blush wines is to fine with bentonite the bentonite fining can be done anytime during the winemaking process but the procedure is more efficient when the 
bentonite fining is done after the new wine has been rough filtered nevertheless many winemakers find it more convenient to stabilize their wines by removing the protein earlier in the winemaking process see below 
bentonite additions rang from one to ten pounds per thousand gallons of wine however high dose rates can strip desirable flavors so bench testing should 
always be done to measure the minimum quantity of bentonite needed the treated wine is allowed to settle for a week or so before it is racked 
tannin in red wine reacts with protein and causes the protein to precipitate out of the wine during fermentation little protein remains at bottling time so protein hazes are seldom a problem in red wine 
combined hot & cold stabilization 
all white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization treatments and some winemakers combine both stabilization procedures into a single operation to reduce handling first the wine is fined with bentonite 
and then the wine is immediately chilled to about 27 degrees the wine is held at the cold temperature for a week or so while the tartrate precipitates when the excess tartrate is gone the cold wine 
is racked or filtered off the bentonite and tartrate lees this combined procedure has some advantages the tartrate crystals settle on top of the fluffy bentonite lees forming a crusty layer and the wine 
is much easier to rack off the compacted lees both procedures are accomplished in a single winemaking operation so labor is reduced wine manipulation is reduced and the risk of wine oxidation is reduced 
finishing white wines 
many of the desirable qualities of light bodied white table wines come from the characteristics of the grapes these wines are only a few months old when bottled because lengthy aging destroys 
the desirable fruit qualities for example light fruity riesling wine is often finished in the following way after fermentation the free sulfur dioxide content is adjusted to about 
30 milligrams per liter and then the wine is hot and cold stabilized after cold stabilization the acid level is adjusted if necessary and the wine is allowed to rest for a few weeks then 
the wine is critically evaluated and any other necessary adjustments are made if large adjustments were made the winemaker would test the wine again for both hot and cold stability 
at bottling time the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine is raised to about 30 milligrams per liter riesling wine normally contains residual 
sugar any residual sugar may cause fermentation to restart so a sterile filter would be used to remove all of the yeast cells from 
the wine when it is bottled most home winemakers do not have sterile filtration equipment so they use a different method to leave residual 
sugar in wine home winemakers add potassium sorbate to the wine the sorbate stabilizes the wine by preventing the yeast cells from

excess protein and hot stabilize the wine

finishing red wines

the finishing process for full bodied red 
polish filtered and bottled wine is different from that described 
figure 6 a typical finishing process for dry white table 
above following cold stabilization most 
wines 
high quality red wines are barrel aged for 12 to 24 months during this lengthy aging period the wine is tasted and tested periodically and the free sulfur dioxide is maintained at a reasonable level 20 to 25 
 mg/l the barrels are topped up each time the wine is tested after the gross lees are removed red wines are racked two or three times a year if the wine seems too astringent the winemaker might use a gelatin 
 or egg whites to reduce the tannin content at the end of the aging period the winemaker tastes and critically reviews the wine for any needed corrections and the free sulfur dioxide level is raised to about 
 30 milligrams per liter the wine is then filtered and bottled high quality red wines are often aged in the bottle from six months to several years during this time the wine develops bottle bouquet 
experience required 
many factors are involved in producing high quality wine and considerable judgment must be exercised throughout the finishing process from 
 the time the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled many winemaking decisions must be made the time wine spends in the barrels 
 the frequency and method of racking how much tannin should be left in the wine etc etc all contribute to the ultimate quality of the product 
 making high quality wine requires experience and good judgment and this kind of preparation is difficult to get by reading books 
summary 
wine enjoyment is strongly influenced by first impressions and our first impression with any wine is visual consequently clarity and stability are extremely important to both homemade and commercial wines 
practically all wines can be clarified stabilized and prepared for bottling using standard winemaking practices these procedures 
 include cooling the wine to cold temperatures fining the wine with suitable materials and using appropriate filtration methods 
all white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization and most commercial red wines are cold stabilized although they are perfectly clear 
 red wines can throw a noticeable deposit after bottling unless they have been stabilized by fining filtering or bulk aged for an unusually long time 
many factors are involved in producing high quality wine and time effort and good judgment are required 
chapter 16 

wine filtration 
most red wines self clarify in a few months and they usually do not require special clarification treatments even when red wines are not brilliantly clear the dark color obscures any slight 
 cloudiness white and blush wines are different here any lack of clarity will be painfully evident and most white or blush wines require one or more specific clarification steps 
cloudy wine is difficult to sell and sometimes getting a white or blush wine clear and bottle bright without using some kind of filtration is difficult consequently practically all commercially produced white and blush wines are 
 filtered before they are bottled of course home winemakers always prefer to produce brilliantly clear wine but such clarity is seldom essential unless the home winemaker actively participates in homemade wine competitions 
filter technology 
in the past thirty years great strides have been made in filter technology now a variety of filters are available for removing microorganisms 
 and these filters can produce sterile wine when used properly molecular sieve filters can remove color and other large phenolic 
 molecules from wine over the past few years reverse osmosis filtration techniques have been developed specifically for the wine 
 industry these sophisticated ultra filtration techniques can selectively remove acetic acid and other small molecules from wine 
desirability 
sterile filtration equipment gives wineries a very useful production tool practically all of the yeast cells can be removed from wine by simple inexpensive filtration off dry 
 and sweet wines can be bottled with little worry the residual sugar will start fermenting and wine quality does not suffer significantly when the filtration is done properly 
in the past wines containing excessive quantities of acetic acid were difficult to handle often these wines were added to sound fermentations in small quantities or acetic wines were sent to the still house to be converted 
 into alcohol now acetic acid can be effectively removed by ultra filtration apparatus and many other defective wines can be salvaged using modern filtration techniques in addition the new filter technologies 
 have significantly reduced wine production costs and the quality of inexpensive jug wines has improved significantly even so extreme levels of filtration are not necessary or desirable for normal wines many 
 winemakers believe the less treatment a healthy wine receives the better the quality of the finished product these winemakers pursue a minimum filtration philosophy for the production of fine wines but 
minimum filtration does not mean zero filtration producing brilliantly clear white or blush table wines without using some reasonable level of filtration is difficult and sometimes impossible 
filter assemblies 
pad type filter assemblies are used by practically all commercial wineries normally pads are made of depth type materials but some manufacturers produce 
 special adapters that allow membrane filter media to be used in their pad type filter assemblies cartridge type filter assemblies are used by 
 commercial wineries and by many home winemakers both depth cartridges and membrane cartridges are made to fit standard cartridge housings each filter 
 material and each filter type is most efficient when used for the intended purpose so the manufacturers recommendations should be followed 
pad filters 
pad type filter assemblies consist of a stack of ridged plastic or stainless steel frames held together by a powerful clamping mechanism each frame is separated by filter pads 
 the wine flows into half the frames through the filter pads and then out of the other frames pad type filter assemblies are made of stainless steel and molded plastic 
 the clamping mechanisms are large and the materials are expensive in addition the frames contain many ridges so they are difficult to manufacture consequently pad type 
 filter assemblies are expensive however when large quantities of wine are filtered filter pads become quite economical so commercial wineries use pad type filters 
cartridge filters 
cartridge type filters consist of filter materials made in the shape of a hollow cylinder the cylindrical filter cartridge is housed in a plastic or stainless steel container wine flows into 
 the housing and through the filter cartridge from the outside to the inside after passing through the filter material the wine flows out of the housing both depth type filter cartridges 
 and membrane type filter cartridges are available cartridge type filter housings made of plastic are used extensively for domestic water filtration these plastic housings are made 
 in large quantities and they are inexpensive filter systems can be built from inexpensive plastic housings simply so home winemakers often use cartridge type filter assemblies 
filter mechanisms 
filtration can be accomplished by two different mechanisms unwanted particles are attracted and entangled in a porous filter material in the first mechanism this type of filtration is an adsorption process 
and electrostatic and adhesion forces are responsible for trapping and retaining the particles the pathways and cavities in the filter material are much larger than the trapped particles this kind of 
filtration is called depth filtration because the particles are trapped within the thickness of the filter material the second filter mechanism is a simple sieve process here the liquid is forced through a 
membrane containing many small holes or pores pore size is large enough to allow desirable smaller particles to pass through the membrane but the pores are small enough to block the larger unwanted particles 
filter membranes are made of special plastic materials the plastic is very thin and the pore diameters can be made very small membrane filters are usually called sterile filters when the pores are small 
enough to remove wine microbes 
depth filters 
depth filters are used to remove grape fragments tartrate crystals yeast cells and general debris from wine depth filters are made by compressing and bonding fibrous substances into a mat or pad in the past 
asbestos fibers were used extensively but modern depth filters are made from specially prepared cellulose the cellulose fibers are specifically processed to give them a net residual electrical charge the long 
path lengths created by the overlaid fibers trap the particles within the body of the pad smaller size particles are retained when the pads are made tighter and more dense however liquid flow through the pad 
becomes 
slower as the density of the pad increases rates of flow for typical 
commercial filter pads are shown in table 12 the rates of flow are for 
water and they are given in gallons per minute for a one square meter of 
pad area at a pressure of 10 pounds per square inch filter flow 
 number rate 
depth filter pads are manufactured in several sizes and in bulk eight by 
eight sixteen by sixteen and thirty six by thirty six inch square pads are common sizes sixteen inch pads are the most popular size for small 2 3 30 26 
winery use pad thickness depends on porosity but most pads are about 4 20 
3/16 inches depth type filter cartridges are made from a variety of 5 16 
materials including cellulose and spun plastic fibers cartridges are made 6 14 
in several sizes and with different end patterns double open ended 10­ 7 11 
inch cartridges are the most popular size single open ended cartridges ek eks 53 
are equipped with buna n gaskets and cartridges with gaskets are

rates through filter pads 
washing depth filters before filtering wine is a standard practice washing removes any contaminates bad odors or off tastes that may be present the standard washing procedure is to assemble the filter system and circulate a 1% 
 citric acid in water solution through the system then the system is drained and clean water is circulated after a short rinse the water coming out of the filter is tasted if the water has a paper taste washing is continued 
porosity 
depth filters can be purchased with porosities ranging from 50 microns to about 0 2 microns two different scales are used to rate the porosity of depth filters and a large difference in particle retention ability exists between 
 the two scales nominal filters are rated using a 50 percent criterion for example a 1 micron nominal filter will pass about half the 1 micron particles present absolute filters use a more stringent standard absolute 
 filters use a 10 out of a million criterion a 1 micron absolute filter only passes ten 1­micron particles out of a million the other 999 990 1 micron particles are retained by the filter obviously a 1 micron nominal filter 
 is far more porous than a 1 micron absolute filter filter pads are usually rated using the absolute scale depth type cartridge filters are rated using the nominal scale unless the rating is specified as absolute 
membrane filters 
membrane filters work in a different way the filter material is a thin flexible plastic membrane a special manufacturing technique is used to produce the plastic and the plastic sheet contains an enormous numberof 
 very small holes a membrane filter acts just like a sieve particles larger than the hole size are mechanically blocked at the surface of the membrane but smaller particles pass right through the holes 
filter membranes are made from several plastic materials including polypropylene cellophane and polyester 
 since the membrane is very thin additional mechanical support must be provided and filter membranes are placed on top of a backing structure to provide greater 
 strength membrane filter cartridges are more expensive than depth filter cartridges because of more complicated construction methods and more costly materials 
the porosity of membrane filters is rated using the absolute scale and porosities are designated by the equivalent size of the holes for wine industry 
 use the three most popular membrane filter porosities use 0 65 0 45 and 0 2 micron hole diameters because of the simple sieve action membrane filters 
 are easily plugged or blocked to reduce plugging all wine going into a tight membrane filter must be filtered with a 1 micron absolute depth filter 
 first membrane filters can be washed and reverse flushed to remove some of the blocking particles and these filters can be reused several times 
membrane filters are used to sterilize wine just before bottling a membrane filter with a 0 45 micron absolute rating will remove all wine yeast and bacteria from the wine 
 membrane filters are commonly used in all commercial wineries and 0 45 micron membrane filters are often mounted on the bottling line just ahead of the bottle filler 
filters for home winemakers 
a filter assembly suitable for the home winemaker can be easily made from standard 10 inch housings these filter housings are used to improve 
 drinking water quality they are made of plastic and they can be purchased for about 25 two plastic tubing fittings 2 are needed to connect 
 plastic tubing to the inlet and outlet ports in the housing this type of filter assembly can be used with any small transfer pump that can deliver 
 a pressure of at least 10 pounds per square inch alternatively a gas transfer system can be used to move the wine through the filter 
one micron nominal depth type cartridges cost about 4 and they are suitable for rough filtration of all types of wine either 0 5 micron nominal depth cartridges costing about 7 or 0 2 micron nominal depth cartridges costing 20 can 
 be used for polish filtration a 0 2 micron nominal cartridge is preferred for final filtration of white and blush wines cartridge life can be extended by carefully cleaning up the wine by fining and racking before it is filtered 
this type of cartridge filter assembly can produce excellent wine clarity and it gives the small producer a very practical filtration system best of all the filter can be easily assembled from standard parts for a few dollars 
summary 
getting white and blush wines sparkling bright is difficult without using some kind of filtration but excessive filtration can strip desirable 
 aromas flavors and color home winemakers often use cartridge type filters and these filters can produce excellent wine clarity 
commercial wineries use sterile filtration techniques when they bottle wines containing residual sugar the filter removes all of the yeast cells and prevents fermentation from occurring after the wine is bottled 
chapter 17 

bottling 
light white table wines and most blush wines are bottled a few months after primary fermentation these wines are valued for their young fruity characteristics 
 and they do not benefit from aging and light heavier bodied white table wines such as chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are usually given several months 
 of bulk aging these heavier white wines and light fruity red wines are usually consumed when one or more years old heavier style red wines are usually given 
 one to three years of bulk aging before they are bottled and then the highest quality red wines are often several years old before they are consumed 
pre bottling adjustments 
bottling is the culmination of the entire winemaking process wine is always oxidized to some extent when the bottles are filled and experienced winemakers take special care throughout the bottling operation oxidation reduces 
 table wine quality so excessive foaming and splashing should be avoided whenever possible although bottling may seem like a simple procedure several important issues need to be considered before the bottles can be filled 
clarity 
all wines must be brilliantly clear before bottling most sound red wines are clear and bright when they are several months old and clarity is seldom a problem for these wines on the other hand 
 practically all white and blush wines and most rose wines require special clarification treatments these wines generally need fining and tight filtration before they attain adequate clarity 
stability 
besides being clear wines must also be stable before bottling blending should be done well before bottling time and the winemaker should observe the new blend for several weeks to be sure the new blend is stable 
 commercial wineries test to be sure their red wines are cold stable but most home winemakers do not bother all white and blush wines should 
 be cold stabilized and these wines may require an additional cold stabilization treatment if much tartaric acid is added late in the 
 winemaking process sometimes a white or blush wine needs a small acid addition just before bottling to improve acid balance citric acid 
 is often used for this purpose and additional cold stabilization is often not needed when moderate amounts of citric acid are used 
all white and blush wines should be tested for stability before bottling wine can be checked for cold stability by placing a small sample in the refrigerator after 48 hours the 
 wine sample is removed from the refrigerator and set aside for several hours when the sample reaches room temperature the wine is carefully examined for cloudiness or deposits 
 white and blush wines can be checked for hot stability by holding a wine sample at 120 degrees after 48 hours at the high temperature 
 the wine is allowed to stand over night at room temperature then the wine sample is carefully inspected for protein haze or sediment 
free sulfur dioxide 
the free sulfur dioxide content of all wines should be measured and raised to about 30 milligrams per liter a few days before 
 bottling bottling wine with less than 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide will result in a short lived product 
residual sugar 
wines containing more than 0 2 percent residual sugar are not biologically stable and these wines can start fermenting anytime most wines are a complete loss when fermentation restarts 
 after the wine is bottled to avoid such catastrophic losses additional precautions are always required when off dry or sweet wines are bottled generally four methods can be 
 used to deal with the residual sugar problem 1 the wine can be pasteurized to kill the yeast 2 ethanol can be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine above 18% 3 sterile filtration 
 can be used to remove all of the yeast cells when the wine is bottled 4 a special material can be added to prevent yeast in the wine from fermenting the residual sugar 
pasteurization reduces wine quality so this process is seldom used for quality table wines adding ethanol is suitable for dessert wines but additional alcohol is seldom desirable in table wines commercial wineries use a sterile filtration 
 process when wines containing residual sugar are bottled but most home winemakers do not have access to sterile filtration equipment home winemakers usually add potassium sorbate to prevent fermentation in off dry or sweet wines 
potassium sorbate 
potassium sorbate does not interact with the residual sugar in any way sorbate prevents fermentation by acting on the yeast cells but it does not kill the yeast sorbic acid passes through the cell membrane easily and the 
 yeast cell is prevented from generating a new bud when enough sorbic acid molecules have accumulated in other words sorbic acid prevents yeast cells from reproducing but it does not stop yeast from fermenting sugar 
sometimes potassium sorbate does not prevent fermentation from restarting because the wine contains too many viable yeast cells when potassium sorbate and sugar are added to a wine containing many viable yeast cells the sorbate 
 prevents the yeast from reproducing but enough yeast cells may be present all ready to ferment the additional sugar then fermentation often occurs after the wine is bottled the wine is spoiled and the winemaker is unhappy 
a different situation exists when sorbate and sugar are added to a well clarified wine the clean wine contains very few yeast cells the sorbic 
 acid prevents the small number of existing yeast cells from reproducing and the added sugar is unaffected even if fermentation occurred only 
 a tiny amount of the added sugar would be lost because only a few yeast cells are present in the wine in time the few active yeast cells in 
 the wine grow old and gradually die after a few months the wine contains practically all of the added sugar and very few viable yeast cells 
using just the right amount of sorbate can be a problem wine flavor can be adversely affected when too much sorbate is used but the wine may restart 
 fermentation if too little sorbate is added the sorbate needed to keep yeast cells from reproducing depends upon several wine properties the 
 normal dose is about one gram of sorbate for each gallon of wine one gram per gallon is equivalent to about 2 level teaspoons per 5 gallons of 
 wine wines with a high alcohol content low ph and 30 to 50 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide present require less potassium sorbate 
an additional problem sometimes develops when potassium sorbate is added to wines low in sulfur dioxide 
 large bacterial populations can exist in wines low in sulfur dioxide sometimes the bacteria in the wine can react with the sorbic acid and a strange geranium like odor is produced 
large quantities of potassium sorbate were used by commercial wineries to stabilize off dry wines before practical sterile filtration equipment 
 became available however sorbic acid is not widely used today because of the potential flavor problems and the high cost of potassium sorbate 
 now sterile filtration is the preferred treatment and few commercial wineries use potassium sorbate potassium sorbate is not a very stable 
 material unopened containers have a reasonable shelf life but after the package is opened potassium sorbate can deteriorate rapidly 
filling bottles 
new glass bottles leave the factory in a sterile condition however new bottles often contain carton dust and even new glass should be rinsed bottles stored for extended times should 
 always be rinsed before filling some home winemakers turn up the hot water heater a few hours before starting to bottle wine then clean previously washed used bottles are rinsed 
 with very hot water just before filling other winemakers rinse each bottle with a sulfur dioxide solution the sulfur dioxide solution is made by mixing 1/4 tsp of sulfite powder 
 and tsp of citric acid in 750 ml of clean cold water this sulfite solution is strong enough to sterilize the bottles but care must be taken to drain the bottles completely 
plastic milk crates are a convenient way of handling glass while bottling milk crates hold about 20 bottles and they are easy to keep 
 clean if one end of the crate rests on a block of wood the empty bottles will be held on a slant and the angle makes filling easier 
wine is always exposed to a significant amount of air when the bottle is filled and a bottle filler of some kind should be used when bottling to reduce this oxidation 
 most home winemakers siphon the wine into the bottles with a piece of clear plastic hose fitted with a plastic wand type bottle filler a simple bottle filler has a 
 small valve on the end of a rigid plastic tube the plastic tube is placed in the empty bottle and the valve opens when it contacts the bottom of the bottle wine begins 
 to flow when the valve opens and the bottle is filled from the bottom little splashing occurs when filling is done slowly and wine oxidation is held to a minimum 
small two or three spout gravity type bottle fillers specifically designed for home winemakers can be purchased for about one hundred dollars and these fillers are very convenient moderate quantities of wine 
are made gravity fillers are much faster than wand type fillers and smaller commercial wineries often use larger multiple spout gravity fillers a gravity filler consists of a small tank to hold the wine a 
float valve assembly that keeps the wine in the tank at a constant level and filler spouts tanks on small two and three spout machines can be filled by siphoning with large diameter tubing tanks on machines 
employing several spouts must be filled with a small transfer pump operation of gravity type bottle fillers is quite simple the operator places an empty bottle on an empty spout and the machine starts filling 
the new bottle filling continues unattended while the operator removes other full bottles and places empty bottles on the spouts when the new bottles become full the machine automatically stops filling once 
the filler is adjusted properly all of the bottles will be filled to the same uniform level little spillage occurs and if the operator is careful the outside surfaces of the bottles remain clean and dry 
although these little machines are simple in design they are surprisingly fast most gravity bottle fillers can fill two bottles per minute for each spout for example a machine with four spouts can fill more 
than eight bottles a minute and one person is kept quite busy changing the bottles 
bottles should be filled until less than 1/4 inch space exists between the top of the wine and the bottom of the cork most wand type bottle fillers leave too much air space in the bottle some winemakers 
 prefer to fill and cork one bottle at a time other winemakers prefer to fill several bottles and then cork the lot in any event leaving full bottles of wine open for long periods is not a good practice 
corking 
standard wine corks are sold in large sealed polyethylene bags containing one thousand corks the corks are sterilized with sulfur dioxide 
 gas when packaged and the corks remain in a sterile condition until the bag is opened the water content of the corks is carefully 
 adjusted just before packaging and the humidity in the bags is carefully controlled corks taken from a sealed bag are soft pliable 
 and resilient they can be driven easily and the soft pliable corks quickly conform to the neck of the bottle and form a tight seal 
dry corks should be driven into the bottle whenever possible but many small hand corking machines cannot adequately compress hard dry corks then the winemaker has little recourse 
 and softening the corks is necessary the normal procedure is to soak hard corks in cold water until they become soft enough to drive with the corker available a pinch 
 of sulfite can be added to the water to help sterilize the corks as they are soaking very wet corks are undesirable because excessive cork water will be left when the corks 
 are driven into the bottle cork water can be avoided by soaking the corks for a few hours and then the corks are covered with a clean cloth and drained overnight 
corks can be quickly softened and probably sterilized in a microwave oven however corks burn easily so some practice may be needed first the corks are rinsed in clean water and 
 then sealed a plastic zip lock storage bag the sealed bag is then placed in a microwave oven some experimentation with the time and power settings will probably be necessary 
corking machines should be adjusted so the top of the cork is set just below the lip of the bottle spilled wine should be removed from the outside surface of the bottles when the corking operation 
 is completed because wine left on the glass makes labels difficult to apply in addition mold often grows on the spilled wine and after a few weeks an unsightly residue can form on the bottle 
labels 
all wine should have a label permanently attached to each bottle producing custom wine labels with a home computer is easy and 
 fun if a scanner and a color printer are available a variety of art work can be incorporated into the label design and very 
 professional looking labels can be produced easily some glues wrinkle light weight papers so labels are best printed on medium 
 weight paper some bond papers seem to work well papers can be tested by wetting one side of a sheet with water and then 
 carefully observing the paper for a few minutes papers that stretch and wrinkle excessively will probably will not be suitable 
 for labels layout 4 6 or 8 labels on standard 8 5 x 11 inch paper if the layout is carefully done the labels will be easy 
 to cut with a paper cutter and little paper will be wasted a few extra labels should be made when the labels are printed the 
 extra labels can be pasted on the cartons to identify the contents and the labels give case goods a professional look 
capsules and labels can be applied when the bottles are clean and dry home winemakers often use an inexpensive short bristled 1 inch brush to apply glue to 
 labels white elmers glue works well with heavy weight papers unfortunately this glue is water based and it may shrink or wrinkle some types of papers 
the following procedure works well for labeling small quantities by hand cut a piece of cardboard a little smaller than the label place 
 the label face down on the cardboard and apply the glue with the brush apply the glued label to the bottle and quickly smooth out 
 any wrinkles try to place the label in the proper position the first time to avoid smearing the bottle with wet glue clean the brush 
 and glue container with warm soapy water when finished a glue stick is very convenient when just a few bottles are being labeled 
when labeling short runs commercial wineries use a label paster to apply just the right amount of glue to the back surface of plain paper labels these machines apply glue quickly and easily 
 and they save a great deal of time unfortunately small pasting machines are expensive new machines cost 600 or 700 second hand machines are in great demand and they are very hard to find 
capsules 
most home winemakers and many commercial wineries use plastic capsules plastic capsules can be obtained in a variety of colors and they can be custom printed plastic capsules are inexpensive and they provide an attractive finished 
 look to any bottle of wine push on capsules are made of heavy weight plastic material and many home winemakers prefer this type of capsule because they are easy to apply the capsule is simply pushed onto the neck of the bottle 
unlike push on capsules heat shrink type capsules are made from thin plastic material they are available in a greater range of colors and 
 finishes and they are slightly less expensive heat shrink capsules are placed over the neck of the bottle and then heat is applied 
 to shrink the plastic material tightly to the bottle large wineries pass the bottles through a heat tunnel to shrink the capsules 
 in place home winemakers use electric heat guns or they shrink the capsule by dipping the neck of the bottle in boiling water

time is required to age wine properly although considerable research has been done no practical way has yet been found to speed up the wine aging process wine ages in two different ways and each type of aging changes the 
 wine in a different way bulk aging takes place in large storage containers and small amounts of air are always present bottle aging takes place after the wine is bottled here no air is present and oxygen is not involved 
most high quality dark red table wines are bulk aged from one to three years after bottling these wines are aged in the bottle for a year or more to develop a bottle bouquet very tannic red wines often require several years of bottle aging 
 to reach maturity heavier white wines are usually bulk aged for several months and then aged in the bottle for an additional time aging in the bottle is best accomplished by placing the bottles on their sides in a cool dark quiet place 
novice winemakers sometimes become very enthusiastic about their first few winemaking efforts and they often consume their wines too early 
 two cases of wine can be consumed in a short time and many new winemakers exhaust their supply before the wine ever approaches maturity 
 this is one argument against making wine in five gallon water bottles a 15 gallon beer keg holds six cases and this is about the smallest 
 size container suitable for home wine production of course five gallon glass bottles are handy for storing leftover wine 
summary 
dirty wine bottles are a potential source of contamination in the home winery dirty bottles should be washed and then placed in clean cartons the cartons of clean bottles should then be stored in a clean dry place 
all wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before it is bottled any blending should be done several weeks before bottling time early 
 blending allows the winemaker to check the wine for several weeks to make sure the new blend is stable before bottling time 
wines containing more than 1/4 percent residual sugar can restart fermenting anytime and these wines must be treated in some way to insure bottle stability home winemakers often use potassium sorbate 
 to prevent fermentation in off dry or sweet wines the right amount of sorbate must be added and wines treated with sorbate should also contain at least 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide 
oxidation is the most common fault found in homemade wines and some wine oxidation always occurs during bottling a bottle filler of some kind should be used and the bottles should be filled slowly from the bottom with a minimum 
 of splashing and bubbling corks should be set flush or slightly below the lip of the bottle all bottled wine should have an appropriate label to identify the contents custom wine labels are easy to make using a home computer

red wine 

 a case history 
carignane grapes are widely grown in france spain california italy and chile carignane is not a well known variety because it is seldom bottled as a varietal wine 
 however carignane grapes produce more red wine than any other grape variety carignane wine is often blended with wines made from other grapes varieties because 
 it is astringent in france carignane wine is the primary component of vin de pays in california it is the major component in hearty burgundy and in most other 
 red jug wines sometimes carignane grapes are called poor mans grapes because carignane produces such large quantities of unremarkable red table wine 
wine made from carignane grown in southern california is often lacking in color however these carignane wines can be quite astringent so the winemaker must handle 
 the primary fermentation carefully when properly fermented and aged in wood for a few months carignane can produce a robust almost friendly red wine 
obtaining grapes 
a local grape grower was contacted the third week in june 1993 arrangements were made to purchase a half ton of carignane grapes for 125 in early october the grower left a message 
 saying the carignane fruit was ripe he said his crew would start picking at daybreak the following saturday and the grapes could be picked up any time after 6 30 a m 
finding the block of carignane vines in the dark was difficult but the darkness did not bother the picking crew the bed of a pickup truck was lined with a large sheet of 4 mil polyethylene and 
 a half ton of carignane grapes was dumped directly into the bed of the truck the grapes were loaded by 6 45 a m they had been off the vines for just a few minutes and the grapes felt cold 
grape processing 
crushing started shortly after 8 00 a m a small power crusher stemmer was placed on top of a half ton plastic fruit bin and the crusher and bin were 
 carefully washed and drained the truck was backed close to the crusher stemmer and the grapes were unloaded with a long handled fork directly 
 from the truck into the crusher stemmer thirty five milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide were added as the grapes were being crushed the fruit 
 bin was about 2/3 full when all of the grapes had been crushed crushing including washing the equipment before and after took about an hour 
testing fruit 
after the equipment had been washed a small sample of juice was tested the juice was measured with a short range hydrometer and the 
 sugar was 23 8 brix the titratable acid was 0 56 percent and the ph was 3 73 the measured data showed the sugar content was fine 
 however the acid content of the grapes was low and the ph of the juice was too high in previous years carignane grapes from the 
 same vineyard always had ta values ranging from 0 55 to 0 60 and a ph of about 3 8 so the low acidity was not a great surprise 
adjust fruit 
about seven ounces of tartaric acid was dissolved in a little water and added to the grapes after the acid addition the titratable 
 acid measured 0 67 percent and the ph value of the juice had dropped to 3 64 grapes from this vineyard had been 
 slow to ferment in previous years and the juice was considered low in nitrogen four ounces of diammonium phosphate were dissolved in a little water and the dap solution was stirred into the fruit to give the yeast a little extra nitrogen 
add yeast 
after lunch a 500 gram package of dry pasteur red yeast was opened and 120 grams of dry yeast were weighed out the temperature of 800 milliliters of water was adjusted to 98 degrees and the dry yeast granules were 
 slowly stirred into the warm water the yeast was stirred several times until the mixture became smooth and creamy after standing for about 25 minutes the rehydrated yeast was added to the crushed carignane grapes 
fermentation 
the grapes showed definite signs of fermentation the following morning by evening a cap had formed and the cap was gently punched down for the first time for the 
 next several days the cap was punched down three or four times each day fermentation was monitored carefully each afternoon the temperature was measured and the 
 sugar content was checked with a hydrometer juice was tasted for astringency and carefully smelled to make sure hydrogen sulfide was not developing on the sixth 
 day after crushing the hydrometer read 4 brix the color of the new wine was light but a noticeable amount of astringency had developed it was time to press 
pressing 
a homemade hydraulic basket press was used to press the carignane pomace the fermentation mass was transferred from the plastic fruit 
 bin directly into the press basket with a three gallon plastic bucket much of the liquid ran through the press as the basket was 
 being filled and an eighteen gallon container caught the liquid coming out of the basket a small magnetically coupled transfer pump 
 and half inch plastic tubing were used to transfer the wine from the press sump into a pair of 42 gallon polyethylene drums 
pressure was applied slowly to reduce the quantity of foam appearing between the slats at the bottom of the basket the pomace cake was broken up twice and three press cycles were needed before the pomace was acceptably dry 
this press has a 1/3 ton capacity so two partial press loads were needed all of the press wine was added to the main batch and the half ton of carignane grapes produced 
 about eighty gallons of wine including the time needed to wash the press before and after and to clean up the mess the pressing operation lasted almost four hours 
completing fermentation 
since the wine was nearly dry foam problems were not anticipated and the plastic drums were sealed with fermentation locks a wine sample was taken every day and the brix was measured with a plus and minus 
 five degree short range hydrometer after the wine had been in the plastic drums for eight days the hydrometer read 1 7 brix after ten days the reading was 1 6 brix and after 13 days it read 1 7 brix 
hydrometer readings had been less than 1 brix and the readings had remained steady for several days the hydrometer readings suggested fermentation was finished so the 
 residual sugar in the wine was measured with a clinitest tablet the measurement showed less than 1/4 percent sugar remained in the wine so fermentation was complete 
cellar work 
twenty days after the yeast addition the wine was dry and it had started to clear the carignane wine was racked for the first time into a 12 year old 60 gallon oak barrel two glass 
 carboys and a one gallon jug most of the gross lees had settled out and care was taken not to disturb the muck seventy one gallons of new wine remained after the first racking 
ml fermentation 
malolactic fermentation started spontaneously in the barrel just as it had in previous years but the wine in the glass containers showed no evidence of ml activity after two weeks 10 gallons of wine was withdrawn from the barrel 
 wine in the glass carboys was pumped into the barrel and the carboys were refilled with the transferred wine after three more weeks a paper chromatogram showed no malic acid remained in the wine in any of the containers 
post fermentation so2 addition 
sulfur dioxide had been added when the grapes were crushed but very little of the initial so2 remains after primary fermentation 
 is complete the absence of malic acid meant malolactic fermentation was complete so a standard post fermentation addition 
 of 50 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine was made to all of the containers after another week the fermentation 
 lock on the barrel was replaced with a silicone rubber bung the barrel was topped up once a week for the first six weeks 
2nd racking 
about four weeks after the first racking all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the barrel and both carboys were washed and then refilled 
 with wine a sample was tested and the measurements showed the wine contained 24 milligrams per liter of free so2 the titratable acid was 0 61 
and the ph was 3 70 
oak chips 
ten ounces of loose oak chips were added to the 60 gallon barrel on january 22 and a small sample of wine was removed the sample was measured and it showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 21 milligrams per 
 liter ta 0 60 and ph 3 70 a sample of wine was taken from the barrel on february 25 the sample was measured and the results were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 
3 73 the free so2 content of the wine was getting too low so 20 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was added 
3rd racking 
the carignane wine was racked for a third time in early march all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the barrel and the 
 carboys were washed and then refilled with wine more than a gallon of cabernet sauvignon wine was needed to top up the second glass carboy 
wine aging 
aging was done in the 60 gallon oak barrel and two 5 gallon glass water bottles 
the wine was tasted and measured on march 29 the results obtained were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 24 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 71 a wine sample 
 was tested on april 24 and this time the results showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? wine tasted harsh so2 19 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 75 
on may 30 the wine was tested with the following results color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 17 milligrams per liter ta 0 56 and ph 3 70 the oak was starting to show the wine seemed astringent 
the wine was tested again on june 27 the test results were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 15 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 
 3 74 the wine seemed too astringent at this time the so2 was low so an addition of 20 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was made 
gelatin fining 
on july 29 the wine was measured again and it was critically tasted by several people the measurements showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 26 milligrams per liter ta 0 57 and ph 
3 76 everyone agreed that the oak flavors were good but four out of five people felt the wine was too astringent 
the wine was tasted several additional times on different days finally a decision was made the wine was too astringent to bottle and it needed to be fined to remove some of the excess tannin about fifty grams of dry gelatin powder 
 were mixed with warm water and the solution was stirred until smooth the gelatin solution was added slowly while the wine was stirred continuously the wine was allowed to stand for ten days and then it racked off the gelatin lees 
getting ready to bottle 
two samples of wine were removed a couple of days before bottling time one wine sample was tasted and used for lab measurements 
 everything seemed fine but the ph was almost 3 8 this is not an unusually high ph value for a red wine made from 
 grapes raised in southern california however such a high ph value reduces the effectiveness of sulfur dioxide therefore enough sulfur dioxide was added to increase the free so2 content of the wine to 40 milligrams per liter the second 
 wine sample was used to fill a clear 375 milliliter wine bottle the bottle was tightly sealed with a cork and the sample was placed in a refrigerator after two days the bottle was removed and allowed to come to room temperature after the 
 bottle had been at room temperature for about 24 hours the sample was carefully examined the wine showed no haze and no tartrate crystals were found in the bottle the wine passed the stability test so it was declared ready for bottling 
bottling 
the 1993 carignane wine was bottled on 16 september 1994 all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the wine was pumped from the temporary 
 container through a one micron absolute pad filter and into a two spout gravity bottle filler the wine was bottled in clean previously washed used
 bottles before being filled each empty bottle was rinsed with clean hot water and then given a sterilizing rinse with a sulfur dioxide solution 
about two hours were required to rinse fill and cork the bottles the next day plastic heat shrink capsules and labels made on a home computer were applied to the bottles the bottles 
 were placed in cardboard cases and extra labels were applied to one side and one end of each case the cases were sealed with clear tape so they could be stacked six cases high 
follow up 
at bottling time the carignane wine was clear and stable the wine had a medium ruby color and a clean nondescript nose it had 
 the typical dusty and woody taste of young over oaked carignane wine the titratable acid was 0 58 the ph was 3 78 and the 
 free sulfur dioxide was 40 milligrams per liter twenty eight cases were bottled at a cost of 7 39 per case 0 62 per bottle 
 after several months the excessive oak taste had diminished and the wine developed a pleasant vanillin bottle bouquet 
chapter 19 
white wine 

 a case history 
many people feel chardonnay is the premier white wine grape it produces the great white burgundy wines including chablis poully fuissj and montrachet and chardonnay vines are 
 widely grown around the world in 1995 about 72 000 acres of chardonnay were planted in california vineyards and it was the most widely planted california wine grape variety 
chardonnay is an early ripening grape variety and it is often the first variety picked each year it has small clusters of round thin skinned light yellow colored berries the thin skin and its early ripening characteristics 
 make chardonnay fruit vulnerable to bird bee and wasp damage chardonnay prefers a cool growing climate and wines made from fruit grown in warm regions often lack acidity and varietal intensity 
chardonnay table wine is often produced in two different styles a light fruity style emphasizes the clean spicy apple characteristics of chardonnay grapes a heavier style wine integrates 
 the rich complex buttery qualities obtained from malolactic fermentation and aging in oak much of the chardonnay wine produced falls somewhere between these two extreme styles 
obtaining grapes 
arrangements were made to obtain chardonnay fruit from a small home vineyard about thirty miles away the arrangements were simple the vineyard owner would supply the grapes the winemaker 
 would supply the corks and bottles and the winemaker would be responsible for harvest decisions and the winemaking grower and winemaker would divide the finished wine evenly 
this vineyard was known to ripen early and the grapes were usually picked in the second or third weeks of august the first sugar sample was taken on july 26 the 
 grapes were tested and the ta ph and brix values were recorded sugar samples were gathered and measured each friday morning until the grapes were picked 
picking & transport 
the grapes were picked very early the morning of 20 august 1995 when it was light enough to see the grapes three people started picking 
 cluster stems were cut with small hand shears and the picked fruit was carried in 5 gallon plastic buckets when the buckets 
 were full they were dumped directly into a half ton fruit bin in a pickup truck about 600 pounds of chardonnay grapes were picked 
 in less than two hours the cold grapes were covered and transported to the crush area quickly before they became warm 
grape processing 

a small power crusher stemmer was placed on top of a ton plastic fruit bin the equipment was washed 
and carefully drained crushing started around 9 30 the grapes were moved from the truck into the 
crusher stemmer with a long handled fork sulfite solution was added as the grapes were being crushed 
the sulfite solution provided 35 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of crushed grapes 
a small vertical basket press was used to press the chardonnay fruit the crushed grapes were transferred 
from the fruit bin into the press basket with a three gallon plastic bucket as the basket was being filled 
about half the juice ran through the press into a 5 gallon bucket when the bucket was full it was emptied 
into a 55 gallon polyethylene drum 

press pressure never exceeded 25 psi and the pressure was applied slowly to reduce foaming the press 
cake was broken up and repressed three times before the pomace was dry the small press had a 200­pound capacity and three complete press loads were required 

including the time needed to wash the crusher and the press before and after the entire crushing and 
pressing operation lasted more than four hours the 600 pounds of chardonnay grapes and much work 
produced forty five gallons of juice 

testing fruit 
testing was done when juice became available sugar content was measured with a short ranged hydrometer a value of 23 3 brix was obtained 
 after a temperature correction was applied the juice was cold the acid was tested and it was 0 58 percent the ph was 3 52 
cold settling juice 
the chardonnay juice was settled in a homemade cold box the cold box is made from 1 inch thick ridged foam insulation panels and it measures 
 four feet wide four feet high and eight feet long the top of the box is hinged and can be raised for easy access a small 7000 btu window 
 air conditioner mounted in one end of the insulated box keeps the temperature of the box below 56 degrees the 55 gallon drum of chardonnay 
 juice was moved into the cold box when pressing was completed the temperature of the juice was 64 degrees when the it went into the box 
in the morning the juice temperature was down to 57 degrees then 39 gallons of clear juice was racked off the sediment into a clean 42 gallon polyethylene drum 
 the remaining six gallons of juice and sediment were resettled in a refrigerator for two days and an additional two gallons of clear juice was reclaimed 
adjust fruit 
the acid content of the chardonnay juice was low just as it had been in previous years and enough tartaric acid was added to raise the ta of the juice to 0 69 percent juice ph was re measured and the tartaric acid addition reduced 
 the ph to a value of 3 41 california chardonnay grapes are often low in available nitrogen so three ounces of diammonium phosphate were also added the dap crystals were dissolved in a little water and stirred into the juice 
fermentation 
forty grams of active dry prise de mousse yeast were stirred into 350 milliliters of warm water water temperature was adjusted to 99 degrees and the yeast mixture was stirred several times the mixture was 
allowed to rehydrate for about 25 minutes when the yeast mixture was smooth and creamy it was stirred into the juice and the drum was sealed with a fermentation lock 
no signs of fermentation were found the following morning and fermentation could not be detected on the second morning however by the 
 evening of the second day the bell in the fermentation lock was up and the chardonnay juice was gassy fermentation was underway 
the temperature of the chardonnay juice was maintained at 56 to 58 degrees during the cold fermentation period each evening the temperature of the fermentation was measured and a hydrometer was used 
 to check the sugar content of the juice five days after the yeast addition the sugar was down to 17 brix after ten days the sugar was about 9 brix and the sugar measured 2 brix after fifteen days 
the chardonnay wine was removed from the cold box on september 5 the container was topped up and the wine was allowed to warm to room temperature after three days at room temperature the wine was measured with a short range 
 hydrometer and the hydrometer read 2 3 brix after two more days the hydrometer reading had not changed and the chardonnay wine seemed dry a complete fermentation record for the chardonnay wine is shown in table 13 
ml fermentation 
malolactic fermentation was started by adding dry viniflora oenos directly to the wine several days later the bell on the fermentation lock was up and 
 ml fermentation appeared to be underway a paper chromatogram was made on october 6 and the chromatogram showed little malic acid remained in the wine 
so2 addition 
since malolactic fermentation seemed finished an addition of 50

table 13 the complete fermentation record for the 1995 chardonnay wine 

milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine mg/l was made to the new chardonnay wine the container was then topped up and sealed with a fermentation lock 
cellar work 
the wine remained on the gross lees for another two weeks after two weeks the wine was racked into a clean container and the container was topped up and sealed with a fermentation 
 lock a sample of wine was tested and the measurements showed the wine contained 22 milligrams per liter of free so2 the titratable acid was 0 64 and the ph was 3 41 
oak chips 
on december 2 five ounces of loose oak chips were added to the chardonnay container a sample of wine was taken and measurements showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 19 milligrams per liter ta 0 65 and ph 3 40 
on january 6 a sample of chardonnay was taken from the container the wine was measured tasted and carefully examined the following results were obtained color ok clarity ok aroma 
 ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter ta 0 64 and ph 3 43 the free so2 was getting low so 25 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was added to the wine at this time 
hot & cold stabilization 
one liter of hot water was placed in a blender and 60 grams of agglomerated bentonite were slowly added to the water while the blender was running at high speed the bentonite mixture was allowed to cool 
 for several hours the mixture was then sealed in a plastic bottle and placed in a refrigerator for a few days in mid january the 60 grams of hydrated bentonite were stirred into the chardonnay wine 
the next day the container of wine was moved into a small upright freezer the freezer is not equipped with an adjustable thermostat but 
 the temperature can be controlled within a few degrees with an electric timer the freezer operated continuously until the temperature 
 of the wine reached 29 degrees the timer was then used to keep the wine temperature between 27 and 30 degrees the wine was held at that 
 cold temperature for six days finally the cold wine was racked into a clean container and allowed to warm to ambient temperature 
aging 
on february 9 the chardonnay was carefully tasted and measured the february testing gave the following information color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 24 milligrams per liter ta 
0 61 and ph 3 46 the winemaker felt that the wine would benefit from more oak character so two additional ounces of oak chips were added to the container 
on march 6 the wine was tested with the following results color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 20 milligrams per liter ta 0 60 and ph 3 44 little oak was showing 
the wine was tested again on april 10 the results of these tests showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter 
 ta 0 58 and ph 3 45 some oak was starting to show an addition of 15 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was made at this time 
getting ready to bottle 
two samples of the wine were taken a couple of days before bottling lab measurements were made on one of the samples and the data showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 19 milligrams 
 per liter ta 0 61 and ph 3 44 the sulfur dioxide was too low so enough sulfur dioxide was added to increase the free sulfur dioxide content of the chardonnay wine to 28 milligrams per liter 
the second wine sample was used to fill a clear 375 milliliter wine bottle the bottle was sealed with a cork and placed in a refrigerator after two days 
 the bottle was removed from the refrigerator and brought to ambient temperature after the sample had been at room temperature for 24 hours the wine 
 was carefully examined the chardonnay wine showed no haze and no tartrate crystals could be found on the bottom of the bottle the wine was declared 
 to be cold stable the next day the container of chardonnay wine was filtered with a 2 micron absolute pad filter to prepare the wine for bottling 
bottling 
the chardonnay wine was bottled on 1 may 1996 to reduce handling the wine was pumped directly from the polyethylene drum through a 0 5 micron filter and into a two 
 spout gravity bottle filler each empty bottle was rinsed with clean hot water and a sulfite solution just before it was placed on the filler spout a little 
 over an hour was required to rinse fill and cork the bottles plastic heat shrink capsules and labels were applied to the bottles the following day and the 
 bottles were placed in cardboard cases labels were placed on each case to identify the contents and the cases were sealed with 2 inch clear plastic tape 
follow up 
at bottling time the wine was brilliantly clear and it had a pale straw color it had a clean nose and an oakey chardonnay 
 taste the titratable acid measured 0 61 the ph was 3 44 and the free sulfur dioxide content was 28 milligrams per liter 
sixteen cases of chardonnay wine were bottled the oak taste diminished significantly after the wine had been in the bottle for a few months 
the grower seemed pleased with the wine when he received his eight cases 
chapter 20 

making sparkling wine 
sparkling wines are produced in france spain italy etc but only those sparkling wines made in a small region of france using the classical method are called champagne sparklers produced anywhere else 
 are properly called sparkling wines sparkling wines are blended from several carefully selected lots of still wine and the french word for the batch of starting wine used to make champagne is cuvje 
 classical sparkling wines are made by applying a multi step process to the blended still wine a second sugar fermentation takes place in the bottle and this fermentation produces a carefully controlled 
 volume of carbon dioxide gas and a small amount of ethyl alcohol the carbon dioxide gas produces the desired effervescence the small quantity of additional alcohol is of little consequence 
four steps are used to produce traditional sparkling wine 1 first sugar and yeast are added to a finished still wine and the wine is bottled 2 fermentation converts the added 
 sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas 3 the new sparkling wine is aged on the yeast lees for a year or more 4 after aging the sparkling wine is finished during 
 finishing upside down bottles are turned repeatedly to work the yeast lees down onto the bottle caps after several weeks of turning when the yeast is on the caps the 
 yeast lees are disgorged from the bottles any wine lost in disgorging is replaced with a small quantity of still wine containing sugar and the bottles are corked 
novice winemakers may find this process complex but the whole procedure becomes relatively simple when each step is understood nevertheless the 
 production of traditional sparkling wine is by necessity a lengthy and labor intensive process the quality of sparkling wine is determined 
 primarily by the starting cuvje and by the length of time the wine is aged on the yeast lees long aging times and extensive handling are required 
 to produce a quality product the considerable time and effort required to produce quality sparkling wine accounts for its high cost 
cuvie 
finished sparkling wine quality depends largely on the characteristics of the starting cuvje and the starting wine should have several specific characteristics 
 the starting wine must be dry or if it contains sugar the quantity of the sugar must be accurately known cuvje should have a clean 
 neutral bouquet and any varietal flavors should be subtle cuvje has a high acid content ranging between 0 7 and 0 9 percent in addition the starting 
 wine should be low in free sulfur dioxide less than 25 milligrams per liter and the alcohol content should be between 10 and 11 5 percent 
grapes harvested specifically for making sparkling wines are picked before they are completely ripe sugar content is often only 17 to 20 brix early picking helps insure subtle varietal 
 flavors and a high acid level early harvested grapes also produce a starting cuvje with a low alcohol content and the low alcohol makes the second fermentation easier to start 
in the champagne region of france cuvje is made from about 2/3 pinot noir grapes and about 1/3 chardonnay grapes chardonnay is a 
 white grape but pinot noir is a red grape most red grapes have colorless juice the color is in the grape skins since the red 
 color is in the skins red grapes must be handled gently and pressed quickly to avoid introducing a blush color into the cuvje 
 in california high quality blanc de blanc cuvje is often blended from wines made from chardonnay and pinot blanc grapes 
 in italy the famous asti spumante sparkling wine is made entirely from white muscat grapes 
blending cuvje 
sparkling wine cuvje must be clean stable and brilliantly clear home winemakers often produce a satisfactory cuvje by blending 
 and modifying available dry white wines generally the alcohol content will be too high when white table wines are 
 used and flavor levels are often to intense however the blend can be diluted with a small amount of water often a 10 percent water addition will reduce the alcohol content too less than 11 5 percent and dilute flavor intensities as well 
the titratable acid and the free sulfur dioxide content of the cuvje will also need adjusting most available table wines will require modest additions of acid to raise the ta to about 0 80 percent large 
 additions of tartaric acid should be avoided or the wine may need to be cold stabilized again citric acid is often used for small acid adjustments because it does not produce instability problems 
the second fermentation in the bottle will be very difficult to start if the sulfur dioxide content of the starting wine is too high when the free sulfur dioxide 
 content exceeds 25 milligrams per liter hydrogen peroxide can be used an addition of 3 5 milliliters of 3% hydrogen peroxide in 5 gallons of wine will remove 
 10 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide wine flavors or aromas are not affected significantly when hydrogen peroxide is used properly however hydrogen 
 peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent bench testing should be done when using hydrogen peroxide and accurate sulfur dioxide measurements are necessary 
measuring the sugar 
the total sugar content of the cuvje must be very carefully controlled if the sugar content is too low the finished wine will not 
 have enough effervescence however if the sugar content is too high excessive pressures will be generated in the bottle and 
 high pressures can cause the bottles to explode when commercial sparkling wines are made enough sugar is added to produce bottle 
 pressures of about 90 pounds per square inch psi however home winemakers are strongly advised to work with less pressure 
 exploding bottles are the subject of jokes but they can be very serious hazards 
one and one half 1 5 ounces of sugar for each gallon of completely dry wine is recommended this quantity of sugar will produce a lively sparkle in the finished wine and bottle pressures will 
 be held to about 40 psi ordinary white granulated household sugar should be used the starting wine must be completely dry and the residue sugar should be measured with a clinitest tablet 
 the quantity of sugar must be accurately weighed and the volume of the cuvje accurately measured do not guess at any of these quantities the carefully measured sugar and a small amount 
 of yeast nutrient should be added to the wine about 1/4 tsp of diammonium phosphate in 5 gallons of wine is the right amount stir the cuvje until all of the sugar and dap are dissolved 
secondary fermentation 
starting the second fermentation is very much like starting a stuck wine the process is quite simple but considerable attention by the 
 winemaker is required first a pint of starter is made from dry yeast and a spoonful of sugar prise de mousse or california champagne 
 yeast should be used these yeasts are tolerant to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide despite its name pasteur champagne yeast is not very 
 good for sparkling wine production this yeast will ferment satisfactorily but pasteur champagne yeast lees are difficult to riddle 
when the starter is active an equal volume of cuvje is added to the starter and the quart of starter is set aside wait until the starter becomes active again then 
 add a quart of cuvje when the starter is again active two quarts of cuvje is added this doubling process is continued until the entire batch of cuvje shows signs 
 of active fermentation the doubling process can be accomplished in twenty four hours or so if the starter is kept warm low temperatures will require more time 
 the cuvje is ready to bottle when a ring of fine bubbles appears around the edge of the container or when the winemaker observes other signs of fermentation 
the starting wine must be bottled in champagne type bottles do not use other kinds of bottles because the pressures are too high each bottle should be cleaned and inspected 
 carefully and any bottles with scratches chips or cracks should be discarded clean sound bottles should be filled until the head space is about two inches 
 all domestic champagne bottles are made with a special lip that allows the bottles to be closed with crown beer caps crown caps should be used to seal the bottles 
 rather than corks caps are less expensive and they are much easier to remove later caps can be quickly and easily applied with a small hand capping machine 
aging 
much of the desired character of sparkling wine is derived from the wine being in contact with the yeast lees for an extended time yeast contact time is very important and a high 
 quality product cannot be produced quickly in france all champagnes must spend at least one year on the yeast lees or the word champagne cannot be placed on the label all 
 high quality sparklers spend from one to four years on the yeast lees some home winemakers produce a three or even four years supply of sparkling wine in a single batch making 
 a large batch every three or four years is a good technique some wine is available to drink after a year but much of the sparkling wine can be aged for an extended time 
sparkling wine should be aged in a cool dark environment free from excessive vibration the bottles can be laid on their sides and stacked 
 up like fire wood when the bottles are stacked this way the yeast lees are spread over a large surface area and the large surface 
 area is an advantage however if adequate space is not available the wine can be stored in cardboard cartons with the bottles standing 
 vertically with the points up in either case the bottles should be shaken gently every six months to agitate the yeast 
sediment back into suspension considerable care leather gloves and safety glasses are appropriate for the shaking procedure 
the finishing process 
sparkling wine is ready to finish after it has aged on the yeast lees for an appropriate time finishing a sparkling wine consists of three basic steps 1 first the yeast lees are induced to slide down the side of the 
 bottle until all of the lees rest on the crown cap by riddling 2 the yeast lees are removed from the bottle by disgorging 3 finally the new sparkling wine is sweetened to the desired level and the bottle is corked 
riddling 
when aging is complete the next step is to remove the yeast lees from the bottle riddling is the name of the process used to move the yeast sediment down onto the crown caps traditionally large wooden racks were used to hold 
 the bottles in a slanted position with their points down and each bottle was rotated about an eighth of a turn each day traditional wood riddling racks are heavy and considerable space is needed when these racks are used 
fortunately other techniques have been developed to coax the yeast down the side of the bottle onto the crown cap a simple method of riddling consists of placing the bottles in ordinary cardboard cartons 
 with their points down then each day the bottles are jostled bumped or twisted early in the process the cartons are propped over at an angle later after the yeast has started to move down the side of 
 the bottle the cartons are moved to a more vertical position the riddling process is strongly influenced by the type of yeast used and the cleanliness of the bottles usually six or eight weeks are needed 
 to complete the riddling operation however under adverse conditions three or four months may be required if the bottles were not scrupulously clean sparkling wine can be almost impossible to riddle 
disgorging pot  abruptly  hallway  nothingness  shouted  noises 
since small producers often work with a minimum of equipment removing the yeast sediment from the bottle is often the most difficult step in the sparkling winemaking 
 process the objective of the disgorging operation is to remove all of the yeast from the bottle without reducing the carbon dioxide pressure significantly 
the classical method of removing the yeast is a multi step process 1 the bottles are chilled with their points down until the 
 temperature of the wine is less than 45 degrees 2 the necks of the bottles are placed in a cold brine solution until a plug 
 of ice an inch or so long freezes in the necks of the bottles 3 the bottles are removed from the brine solution and the 
 necks of the bottles are dipped in clean room temperature water 4 after the brine has been washed away the necks of the 
 bottles are raised to a 45­degree angle and the crown caps are removed quickly 5 the plugs of ice flies from the bottles 
 and the ice carries most of the yeast sediment away 6 the winemakers left thumb is judiciously applied to each bottle to 
 control gushing if the wine is cold and if the bottles were clean gushing quickly subsides 7 the winemaker then uses the 
 little finger on his right hand to wipe away any remaining yeast from the inside surfaces of the mouths of the bottles 
a written description of this process sounds complicated but after a few bottles have been disgorged the whole procedure becomes quite simple and the work progress rapidly 
sweetening and corking 
most people prefer off dry sparklers and wines containing 1 to 4 percent residual sugar are common the desired level of sugar is introduced by adding a small dose of syrup to each bottle after the yeast has been removed 
 this syrup also contains a small amount of sulfur dioxide to help preserve the sparkling wine the syrup is made up ahead of time and the syrup must be well chilled before it is added to the disgorged bottles 
a typical syrup contains 375 grams of sugar one gram of sulfite powder and 700 ml liters of dry white wine when 30 ml of this syrup is added to a standard 750 ml bottle the finished sparkling wine will 
contain about 2 percent sugar and about 30 milligrams per liter sulfur dioxide of course the sugar and so2 can be adjusted to any desired level 
syrup should be added to the bottles after any remaining yeast has been wiped away each bottle is tipped to a 60 degree angle so the syrup runs down the inside surface of the bottle the syrup must be cold and 
it must be added slowly and continuously to avoid gushing after the syrup has been added the liquid level in the bottle should be adjusted by adding wine from a reserved bottle of cold sparkling wine when the 
head space is correct the bottle can be sealed with a polyethylene stopper and a wire hood should be attached to hold the stopper in place after all the bottles are sealed the outside surfaces should be 
rinsed clean with cold water then the bottles can be set aside to dry and labels can be applied after the bottles reach room temperature new sparkling wines should be allowed to rest for a few weeks in a cool 
quiet place to recover from bottle shock after a short rest the sparkling wine will be ready to use sparkling wines usually keep well but after the yeast has been removed the wine will show little improvement 
with further aging 
summary 
sparkling wine is made by adding sugar and yeast to a still wine and the wine is tightly sealed in bottles specially designed to withstand high 
 pressures a second fermentation takes place in the bottle and the carbon dioxide gas produced gives the wine the desired effervescence 
quality sparkling wine is aged on the yeast lees for a year or more then the wine is ready to finish the yeast is worked down the side of the bottle until all the sediment 
 rests on the cap and then the yeast is expelled from the bottle the wine is then sweetened with syrup and the bottle is sealed with a polyethylene stopper 
the starting wine must be dry and the added sugar must be measured carefully only sound champagne type bottles can be used for making sparkling wine 
chapter 21 

making fruit wines 
the grape harvest period in southern california extends from about mid august until early october so wine can be made from grapes only a few weeks each year 
 on the other hand excellent wines can be made from fresh fruit six or seven months of the year when frozen fruit is used wine can be made the year around 
making fruit wine is different from making wine from grapes grapes have just about the right amount of sugar and acid to make a balanced wine 
 but most other kinds of fruit require large additions of sugar and significant acid adjustments fruit winemaking is more complicated because 
 the acidity of different types of fruit varies over wide ranges consequently when fruit wine is made the winemaker must carefully measure 
 and adjust both the sugar content and the acid content of the fruit these basic adjustments are made before fermentation is started 
although dry wines can be produced easily most people prefer off dry or semi sweet fruit wines a small amount of residual sugar seems to preserve and enhance the characteristics of the fruit used to make 
 the wine consequently most fruit wines are finished with a sugar content ranging from one to four ounces of sugar per gallon of wine 0 75 to 3 percent sugar some types of fruit seem particularly 
 suitable for making dessert style wines these wines often contain four to twelve ounces of sugar per gallon of wine 3 to 9 percent sugar and they are often fortified with additional alcohol dry red 
 table wines can be made from elderberries blackberries blueberries loganberries and boysenberries sometimes dry well aged berry wines are difficult to distinguish from high quality grape wine 
fruit winemaking steps 
making fruit wine consists of several different steps and some steps require considerable time drinkable wine can be made in two or three months but most high quality 
 white or blush fruit wines are bottled when they are about six months old heavy dark colored fruit wines are often nine to twelve months old when bottled 
fruit winemaking can be divided into five basic steps each of the following steps contributes to the overall quality of the wine however the quality of the finished wine depends primarily on using high quality ripe fruit 
 1 fruit is inspected and prepared for fermentation 
 2 appropriate amounts of water sugar acid and sulfur dioxide are added to the fruit and sometimes other materials are added to produce a fermentable must 
 3 fermentation is started by adding a suitable wine yeast to the prepared must 
 4 when fermentation is complete the new wine is clarified and stabilized by racking fining and filtering 
 5 when the wine is clear and stable it is bottled 

fruit 
wine can be made from practically any type of fruit but not all types of fruit are suitable for making all styles of wine selecting a wine style to match the type of 
 fruit available is an important part of fruit winemaking and winemaking experience is needed when wine is made from exotic fruits like pineapples guavas or mangos 
amount of fruit 
the quantity of fruit needed to make a given wine style depends on the flavor intensity of the particular fruit and on the flavor 
 level wanted in the finished wine usually from 3 to 6 pounds of fruit are needed for each gallon of wine raspberries and a few 
 other types of fruit have very strong flavors and wine made from six pounds of raspberries per gallon have intense raspberry 
 flavors other fruits such as bananas have very bland tastes and producing wines with strong banana tastes would be difficult 
three to six pounds of fruit per gallon of wine generally produce an acceptable product however experience with a particular type of fruit is always helpful when a winemaker 
 is trying to decide how much fruit to use unless exceptionally strong fruit characteristics are wanted three or four pounds of fruit is a good starting point 
fruit preparation 
only sound ripe fruit should be used for winemaking most types of fruit should be washed to remove insecticides fungicides 
 or bugs superficial blemishes on the fruit will do no harm but rotten fruit should be discarded moldy fruit will give 
 the finished wine a moldy taste and rotten or badly bruised fruit can carry harmful bacteria into the wine off flavors can be avoided by sorting over the fruit carefully and using a sharp knife to remove gross blemishes rot or mold 
stems and leaves should be removed from the fruit generally seeds should be removed if they have a distinctly bitter taste and most fruit winemakers prefer to remove the stones from plums prunes 
 peaches apricots and cherries however some winemakers deliberately retain some seeds from these fruits to provide extra tannin most stone fruit wines are made in an off dry or sweet style 
on the other hand skins contain desirable flavor materials so skins are usually retained usually plums prunes apricots peaches and most berries are fermented with the juice pulp and skins together for a few 
 days to extract flavors here the fruit should be chopped and then crushed running fruit through a very course grinder is a practical way of preparing large quantities of fruit for this type of fermentation 
although most fruit wines are made with some residual sugar some very pleasant dry red table wines have been made by fermenting a mixture of several different kinds of dark colored berries this style of red 
 fruit wine is often fermented aged and finished just like a red grape table wine juice skins pulp and seeds of blackberries boysenberries cranberries elderberries blueberries gooseberries loganberries 
 mulberries raspberries and strawberries are usually included in the fermentation berries used for winemaking should be very ripe and sorted carefully berries can be prepared for fermentation easily 
 by mashing seeds contain a variety of tannin materials too much tannin can give wine a bitter taste and make wine excessively astringent so seeds should not be ground mashed or cracked 
wine made from oranges oxidizes very easily and good orange table wines are difficult to make however pleasant sherry style wines can be easily made from oranges citrus fruit skins contain considerable oily material 
 and most winemakers prefer to eliminate skins from citrus fruit fermentations the membrane under grapefruit skins contains much bitter material and this white pulpy material should be removed carefully 
many fruit winemakers simplify the handling of skins and pulp by placing these materials in a nylon mesh jelly bag when fermentation is started the jelly bag full of pulp 
 is suspended in the liquid the wine gets all the benefits from the solid materials but separating the liquid from the pulp at the end of fermentation is much easier 
making the must 
grapes contain all the necessary ingredients to make a balanced wine but other kinds of fruit require additions of several different materials before successful 
 fermentation can take place besides the fruit good quality water will be needed and at a minimum the sugar and acid content of the must will need adjusting 
the sugar content of the must can be measured easily with a brix hydrometer a reading of about 22 brix will be right for most fruit wine fermentations add a small quantity of sugar to the must stir until all the sugar is dissolved 
 then take a reading with the hydrometer continue this procedure until the hydrometer reads 22 brix ordinary white granulated table sugar sucrose should be used to increase the sugar content of the prepared fruit 
an acid test kit should be used to measure the acid content of the must a value of 0 65 to 0 70 percent grams per 100 ml is about right for the starting acid content for off dry fruit wines a value of 0 60 to 
0 65 percent may be more appropriate when the wine will be finished dry acid blend is available at winemaking shops and most winemakers use this material to increase the acidity of 
 fruit musts acid blend is a mixture of citric malic and tartaric acids and this mixture seems particular suitable for fruit wines the acid crystals must be completely dissolved 
very small amounts of sulfur dioxide should be added to musts made from fruit one campden tablet for each gallon of must is the right amount the sulfur dioxide reduces juice oxidation sulfur 
 dioxide kills bacteria and it also helps control wild yeasts always present on fruit making a satisfactory fruit wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult 
depending on the specific circumstances tannin may be added to fruit wine musts tannin is a material in the skins and seeds 
 of fruit and it adds desirable astringency to the wine tannin also acts as a wine purifier and a natural preservative 
yeast requires nitrogen to multiply properly during the early stages of fermentation and many fruits are low in available nitrogen consequently small quantities of a material called yeast energizer 
 are often added to fruit musts to supply extra nitrogen and help the yeasts multiply quickly many fruits particularly apples and plums have a high pectin content pectin causes fruit juice to 
 solidify into jam or jelly and pectin can cause problems in wine the pectin carries over through fermentation and makes the wine difficult to clarify most fruit winemakers add pectic enzymes see 
 below to their fruit musts before fermentation is started enzymes break down the pectin in the fruit and then the wine can be clarified easily enzymes also help extract color from the fruit 
many fruit winemakers add mashed fresh bananas to their fruit wine musts the bananas do not change wine flavors significantly but after fermentation the bananas 
 help the new wine clarify bananas also increase the body of the wine and from to 2 pounds per gallon often improve the mouth feel of the finished wine 
fermentation 
wine yeast is available either as a liquid culture or in dry granular form either type works well but dry yeast is easier to prepare and use many different strains of wine yeast are available some types 
 of yeast can produce high alcohol levels other types of yeast cannot ferment at low temperatures some types of yeast produce excessive amounts of foam and the foam causes the containers to overflow 
 epernay ii is a slow fermenting yeast and it is often used for light off dry fruity style wines pasteur champagne yeast is more vigorous and it is often used for dry wines when neutral flavors are 
 wanted prise de mousse dry yeast is a general purpose yeast this yeast is vigorous but it produces little foam the yeast used for fermentation has little influence on the flavors of aged wine 
a good general rule is to use one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must some winemakers prefer using half this amount other winemakers prefer to use twice 
 this amount many fruit winemakers just sprinkle the dry yeast on the must but all yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry yeast in a small amount 
 of warm water about a cup of water for each tablespoon of dry yeast should be used the temperature of the water should be 95 degrees so a thermometer should 
 be used the yeast mixture should be stirred several times and then the yeast mixture should stand for 20 minutes before it is poured into the must 
active fermentation should start 12 to 48 hours after the yeast is added the time will depend upon the temperature of the must how much sulfur dioxide is used and several other factors when 
 fruit pulp is fermented in an open fermenter the container should be covered with a sheet of plastic stir the must at least once each day after two or three days of active fermentation 
 the liquid is separated from the pulp with a nylon jelly bag by racking or by straining the solid materials are discarded and the liquid should be placed in a closed container to finish 
 fermentation carbon dioxide gas from the fermentation must be vented from the closed contained fill a fermentation lock half full of plain water and attach the lock to the container 
generally hot fast fermentations are undesirable rapid fermentations produce large quantities of carbon dioxide and much of the desirable fruit odors and flavors are carried away by the 
 gas in addition fast fermentations do not provide enough time to extract adequate fruit odors and flavors from the solid materials long slow fermentations produce more flavorful 
 wines and fermentation temperatures can affect wine flavors considerably temperatures between 70 and 75 degrees are desirable at the start of fermentation however once fermentation 
 is underway the temperature should be reduced and kept between 60 and 70 degrees the lower temperature provides the slow fermentation needed for good wine quality 
dry white wines 
making good quality dry white table wine from fruit is a difficult undertaking but fruit winemakers become very skilled in producing this style of wine the 
 most suitable types of fruit for making dry table wines are pears apples or gooseberries these types of fruit are also suited for making sparkling wines 
dry white table wines are best made by fermenting only clarified juice first the fruit is washed and then converted to purje by crushing some winemakers prefer to use a food processor for preparing fruit for dry white wine 
 but the seeds should not be ground up water sugar acid sulfur dioxide and all of the other ingredients except the yeast are added to the finely chopped fruit the must is then covered with a sheet of plastic and cooled to 
 a low temperature the must is kept cold for 24 to 72 hours to extract as much flavor from the pulp and skins as possible after a suitable time the liquid is separated from the solid material much of the solid material settles 
 to the bottom of the container while the must is standing and the clear liquid came be removed by siphoning straining or pressing the solids are discarded and only clear juice is fermented when making dry table wines 
all fruit contains natural yeast and this technique of cold soaking is only possible if the must is kept cold otherwise native 
 yeasts will start spontaneous fermentation even at low temperatures some danger of spontaneous fermentation exists and 
 the winemaker should watch the cold must carefully if any signs of spontaneous fermentation appear ring of bubbles around 
 the edge of the container the juice should be racked off the solid material and a suitable wine yeast should be added 
an open fermenter is not needed when clarified juice is fermented so a closed fermenter should be used to reduce oxidation fill the closed fermenter about three fourths full and seal 
 the container with a fermentation trap filled with plain water when fermentation is complete rack the wine off the yeast lees and add one campden tablet for each gallon of wine 
clarification and stabilization 
new wines contain yeast cells bacteria small bits of skin pulp etc these particles are pulled down by gravity and they slowly settle to the bottom of the container the smaller 
 the particle the slower it sinks to the bottom of the container some particles are so small they never sink to the bottom and these particles remain suspended in the liquid 
 racking is a process used to separate the clean wine from the lees the muck on the bottom of the container after wine has been racked two or three times the muck will be gone and the wine will become clear and bright when small 
 containers are used racking is usually done by siphoning the wine off the lees with a piece of transparent plastic hose exposing wine to air can cause oxidation so wine should not be splashed frothed or bubbled when racking 
new wines should be racked into a clean container two or three weeks after the completion of fermentation most of the yeast lees will be left behind if the racking is done carefully one campden tablet for each gallon of wine 
 should be added and the container sealed with a fermentation lock when fruit wines are six to eight weeks old they should be racked from the secondary lees and a few weeks after the second racking some fruit wines will 
 be clear and bright if a new fruit wine is not clear at this time it should be fined to remove the suspended particles the fining material causes the very small particles to lump together the particles grow in size and the 
 larger particles settle out of the wine more quickly sparkolloid and bentonite are two effective fining materials for clarifying fruit wines follow the directions on the packages carefully when using these materials 
sparkolloid is the least harmful fining material too much bentonite can strip desirable aromas and flavors from fruit wine so most winemakers prefer to clarify with sparkolloid three weeks after a sparkolloid addition the wine 
 should be racked again to separate it from the sparkolloid lees splashing and bubbles in the wine should be avoided when racking if sparkolloid does not provide adequate wine clarity a bentonite treatment may be necessary 
most off dry fruit wines will be ready to prepare for bottling a month or two after clarification fining some home winemakers hold back a small quantity of the original 
 juice by freezing a few weeks before bottling time the juice is thawed clarified by racking and added to the wine the added juice provides more fruity flavors and 
 it adds a small amount of residual sugar to the wine however the wine contains sugar after the juice addition and special precautions are required to prevent renewed 
 fermentation see below how much juice is added can be best determined by tasting but many winemakers add 5 to 20 percent juice when this method is used bottling 
fruit wines must be brilliantly clear and completely stable before bottling wine bottled without sufficient so2 will be short lived so the free sulfur dioxide content should 
 be raised to 30 or 40 milligrams per liter a few days before bottling time one crushed campden tablet for each gallon of wine is the correct amount if sugar is added 
 to sweeten the wine potassium sorbate should also be added the added sugar will start to ferment without the sorbate and fermentation after bottling will generally produce 
 a cloudy sediment and spoil the wine directions supplied with the sorbate should always be followed and sorbate additions should always be measured carefully 
clean used wine bottles should be rinsed with very hot water before the bottles are filled with wine although bottles can be filled with a plastic hose 
 a bottle filler of some kind should always be used to reduce wine oxidation bottles should be filled from the bottom and filling should be done slowly 
 to reduce the quantity of foam produced bottles should be filled until no more than a quarter inch of space exists between the wine and the bottom of 
 the cork most plastic wand type bottle fillers do not fill the bottles high enough and a bit more wine must be added after the filler is removed 
dry corks should be driven into the bottles if possible however many small corking machines will not adequately compress dry corks so soaking corks 
 in cold water for a few minutes may be necessary a pinch of sulfite added to the water may help sterilize the corks after all the corks 
 have been driven the top of each cork should be wiped to remove the excess cork water the full bottles should stand upright for several days to 
 let the pressure equalize in the bottles when the pressure has equalized the bottles can be laid on their sides and stored in a cool place 
after wine has been bottled for a year or two the winemaker may have trouble remembering what type of wine is in the bottles so all bottled wine should have an appropriate label permanently attached 
fruit winemaking materials 
depending on the circumstances winemakers use many different materials for the production of fruit wines 
 most fruit wine fermentations are made using readily available materials but an exotic material may be needed occasionally to solve a specific problem some common fruit winemaking materials are briefly discussed here 
acid 
the three most important organic acids found in fruit are tartaric malic and citric acid balance is very important for producing high quality wine and the acid content of the fruit 
 must be adjusted carefully if the wine contains too little acid it will taste flat and bland when too much acid is present the wine will be too tart or even sour tasting 
 wines containing considerable sugar need more acid to be balanced tartaric acid malic acid citric acid or acid blend a mixture of all three acids are used to increase the acid 
 level in fruit wines large quantities of citric acid should be used with some caution because a strong citric taste may not be appropriate in some types of fruit wine 
fining materials 
fining agents are often used in the production of fruit wines gelatins are sometimes used to remove excess astringency from fruit wines the clay like material bentonite is used to remove excess protein and improve 
 the stability of these wines sparkolloid and bentonite are the two materials of choice for clarifying most types of fruit wine wines are usually fined with sparkolloid first then if the wine does not come 
 clear bentonite is used other fining materials like isinglass or casein are also used to clarify both red and white fruit wines most fining materials require from a few days to two weeks to settle to the bottom 
 of the container then the clear wine is racked off the sediment and very little of the fining material remains in the finished wine instructions supplied with fining materials should be followed carefully 
pectic enzymes 
pectin makes jam and jelly set all fresh fruits contain some pectin and some types of fruit like apples apricots and plums contain large 
 amounts pectin often causes problems for the fruit winemaker pectin can hold small particles in suspension and wines containing 
 excessive pectin often do not clear and remain cloudy pectinase is an enzyme that breaks the large pectin molecules into smaller 
 less troublesome molecules so pectinase is a great help in clarifying cloudy wines containing excessive amounts of pectin 
potassium sorbate 
wines containing residual sugar and less than 16 percent alcohol can start fermenting anytime consequently all off dry and sweet wines must be stabilized by 
 a special treatment potassium sorbate added to clean clear wine can prevent fermentation from restarting however sorbate will not stop active fermentations 
 and sorbate cannot stop wines containing many yeast cells from fermenting sorbate only works when the wine has been carefully racked or filtered to 
 remove most of the viable yeast cells potassium sorbate is not a very stable material and poorly stored sorbate can deteriorate in a few months 
sulfur dioxide 
sulfur dioxide is used in wine to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and to help reduce the effects of oxidation however sulfur dioxide is a pungent gas this material must be carefully measured and it must be used in 
 very small quantities potassium metabisulfite sulfite crystals are added to juice or wine to provide the sulfur dioxide gas campden tablets are made by compressing sulfite crystals into a pill form so campden tablets 
 can also be used to provide sulfur dioxide some winemakers believe campden tables contain a filler and the filler causes haze problems in some kinds of wine campden tables are easier to use when just a few gallons of 
 wine are being produced however when larger quantities of wine are made most winemakers prefer to use sulfite crystals the crystals should be mixed with an ounce or two of water before being added to the wine sugar 
the alcohol content of the finished wine depends upon the quantity of sugar in the juice sometimes home winemaking shops recommend special kinds of sugar but ordinary 
 white household sugar sucrose is quite satisfactory for making fruit wine the yeast produces the enzymes needed to convert the sucrose into glucose and fructose 
tannin 
tannin materials give wine its characteristic astringency tannin helps a young wine spontaneously clear and it contributes 
 to the longevity of the wine tannin originates in the seeds stems and skins of fruit some types of fruit like bananas 
 contain very little natural tannin and producing a balanced wine from fruit low in tannin can be difficult consequently winemakers often add extra tannin to fruit musts that lack sufficient natural astringency yeast energizer 
yeast cells need available nitrogen to reproduce and create the large population of cells needed for successful fermentation yeast energizers contain food grade diammonium phosphate dap and the dap provides extra nitrogen to keep the 
 yeast happy healthy and reproducing new yeast cells high alcohol levels seem to prevent yeast from assimilating nitrogen so nitrogen should be added early in the fermentation cycle before a large amount of alcohol has accumulated 
wine yeast 
a variety of wine yeasts can be obtained in dry form epernay is a very popular yeast for all types of fruit wines pasteur champagne yeast is vigorous and tolerant of sulfur dioxide prise 
 de mouse is an excellent general purpose wine yeast winemakers use many different types of yeasts but the different yeasts are used for reasons other than creating wine flavors 
fruit winemaking equipment 
with one or two exceptions little special equipment is needed to make fruit wine and many home winemakers ferment small quantities of wine each year using implements from 
 the kitchen however specialized winemaking equipment can reduce time and labor and purchasing specialized pieces of winemaking equipment may be desirable when large 
 quantities of wine are made beginning winemakers should beware of the gadgets sold in some home winemaking shops many of these accessories are poorly designed and cheaply 
 made like most other things cheap winemaking equipment is generally a poor value several basic pieces of fruit winemaking equipment are briefly discussed below 
acid test kit 
the acid content of different kinds of fruit varies widely and acid content varies from year to year the only practical way of controlling 
 acid balance in the finished wine is to measure and adjust the acid content of the must before fermentation is started 
 wine quality improves greatly when the winemaker obtains the necessary equipment and takes the time to learn how to measure 
 acidity acid test kits for measuring the acid content of must juice or wine can be purchased at most home winemaking shops 
bottle filler 
to reduce wine oxidation bottles must be filled from the bottom with a minimum of splashing and bubbling 
 filling bottles without splashing is difficult with a siphon hose so an inexpensive wand type bottle filler should be used 
 wand type fillers consist of a length of rigid tubing with a small valve at the bottom end when the filler is inserted 
 in an empty bottle the valve presses against the bottom and the wine starts to flow the flow stops automatically when the 
 operator raises the tube fillers allow bottles to be filled with a minimum of splashing and wine oxidation is minimized 
corker 
driving a cork into a wine bottle by hand is very difficult so a corking machine of some kind is needed when using cork finished bottles 
 inexpensive corking machines are slow and most are difficult to use most of the inexpensive machines are not suitable for corking 
 more than a few gallons of wine a good corking machine is indispensable when several cases of wine are produced unfortunately good 
 floor corkers cost about 100 corkers are not used very often and beginners can often borrow a corker from a fellow winemaker 
fermentation locks 
fermentation locks are used on closed fermenters to let the carbon dioxide gas escape while keeping air from coming in rubber stoppers are used to attach the locks to the containers 
fruit wine containers 
wine must always be protected from air or the wine will oxidize and become undrinkable winemakers use two kinds of containers during active fermentation large amounts 
 of carbon dioxide gas are produced and the gas effectively excludes the air from the wine consequently open fermenters can be used for the first few days 
 of fermentation when lots of carbon dioxide gas is produced when fermentation starts to subside much less carbon dioxide gas is produced then the wine must be 
 transferred into a closed container and a fermentation lock must be attached the lock lets the carbon dioxide gas escape but it keeps air out of the container 
open fermenters are used for mixing ingredients or they are used for fermentations that contain solid materials like skins or pulp a large food grade polyethylene 
 container equipped with a removable lid makes an ideal open fermenter however many fruit winemakers have used new plastic trash cans as open fermenters 
closed fermenters have small openings and they can be sealed easily with a cork cap bung or fermentation lock closed containers are always used when the fermentation does not 
 contain solid materials and closed containers are always needed at the end of all fermentations when the co2 gas starts to subside five gallon water bottles carboys make 
 good closed fermenters and they are very popular for making fruit wine water bottles are easy to obtain and glass is easy to clean and sterilize however glass water bottles 
 have several disadvantages glass water bottles are heavy and they are expensive glass is fragile so glass carboys must be handled very carefully to avoid breakage 
some winemakers prefer to use polyethylene drums for making fruit wines and these containers are available in sizes ranging from 
 10 to 60 gallons polyethylene containers have several advantages polyethylene drums are practically unbreakable and they 
 are inexpensive plastic drums are light weight and easy to store some commercial wineries are now using polyethylene storage 
 tanks these new tanks are made of high density polyethylene and they are much less expensive than stainless steel tanks 
stainless steel is still the material of choice for large commercial fermentation and storage tanks stainless tanks are easy to clean and stainless steel conducts heat well small size stainless steel containers 
 are very expensive and often cost several dollars per gallon of capacity however used stainless steel beer kegs are readily available and they make excellent storage containers for all kinds of wine 
oak barrels are often used for aging high quality commercial red wines the oak wood imparts desirable flavors to the wine however oak flavors 
 are not suitable for many types of fruit wines in addition new barrels are expensive and oak barrels are difficult to maintain properly 
hydrometer 
hydrometers are used to measure the sugar content of must before and during fermentation and a hydrometer is one of the few indispensable pieces of winemaking equipment 
 most fruit does not contain enough sugar to make stable wine so additional sugar is usually needed different kinds of fruit contain widely varying amounts of sugar 
 and a hydrometer is always needed to measure fruit wine musts some fruit winemakers prefer hydrometers calibrated in specific gravity because many fruit wine recipes 
 list sugar content in these units commercial winemakers use hydrometers calibrated with the brix scale a cylinder is needed to use a hydrometer effectively 
racking hose 
racking is done to move wine from one container to another and when racking is done properly practically all of the sediment is left 
 behind siphoning is the easiest way of transferring wine from one container to another and a 6 foot length of inch plastic tubing 
 should be kept specifically for that purpose the tubing should always be washed just before it is used and then washed again when 
 racking is finished finally hang the tubing up on a rack or several nails driven into a wall so the water can drain completely 
miscellaneous equipment 
a thermometer is often needed to monitor fermentation temperatures and to measure water temperature when rehydrating dry yeast an 
 8 inch plastic funnel is useful from time to time a large wooden spoon is handy for stirring small fermentations bottle brushes 
 are necessary when old wine bottles are recycled a set of plastic measuring spoons is helpful for measuring small quantities of 
 winemaking materials a large plastic beaker calibrated in both milliliters and liquid ounces is handy for measuring liquids 
summary 
little specialized equipment is required to make fruit wines and most of the items can be found in the kitchen excellent wines can be made from fruit and fresh fruit is available 
 for several months each year most fruit wines are finished in an off dry or sweet style but very pleasant dry red table wines can be made from a mixture of dark colored berries 
many fruit wines are made by fermenting the pulp skins and juice together dry white table wines are made differently first the must is prepared 
 then chilled and allowed to stand after about 48 hours the clear liquid is separated from the pulp and only the clarified juice is fermented 
most fruit wines do not require extensive aging however dry red wines made from dark colored berries are often finished and aged just like red grape wines

hints kinks and gadgets 
winemaking consists of many small operations and some winemaking procedures are only done once each season consequently several years of experience may be 
 needed to develop basic winemaking skills novice home winemakers can get many useful ideas and gain experience by visiting experienced home winemakers or 
 small commercial wineries much practical information can be learned simply by observing how specific winemaking operations are done and tricks of the trade 
 can be learned quickly a variety of information on methods techniques and gadgets suitable for producing small quantities of wine is presented here 
getting ready 
some home winemakers are disappointed each crush season when they are unable to purchase wine grapes these winemakers discover they have 
 waited too long and grapes are no longer available beginning winemakers often experience this problem and they become frustrated 
 other winemakers simply procrastinate and they are never ready to make wine when the grapes become ripe these winemakers suddenly 
 discover the grapes are ripe and they scramble to get their winemaking equipment checked cleaned and ready to process the grapes 
buying grapes 
vineyard managers like to sell their crops early in the year commercial wineries usually complete their arrangements for purchasing grapes by june 
 or early july home winemakers should contact commercial growers as early as possible and complete arrangements no later than the 4th of july 
getting equipment ready 
most home winemakers should consider the first week in august as get ready time and all of the winemaking equipment should be taken out of storage checked repaired and cleaned thoroughly the equipment will then be 
 ready to handle the crush expeditiously when the grapes are ripe an inventory of winemaking supplies should be taken and orders should be placed for needed materials yeast and sulfite should be replaced each year 
wine yield 
commercial wineries use automatic or semiautomatic horizontal presses and a minimum amount of labor is required to produce dry pomace with these machines depending on the variety of grapes 
 horizontal presses produce 150 to 180 gallons of wine per ton of grapes on the other hand most home winemakers use small vertical basket presses these little presses can produce 
 high quality juice however considerable work is required and most home winemakers are not prepared to expend the labor needed to dry the pomace completely consequently home winemakers 
 often get 140 to 150 gallons of wine from a ton of grapes a case of wine contains 2 4 gallons so most home winemakers get from 58 to 62 cases of wine from a ton of fruit 
grape quantities needed 
sometimes beginning winemakers have trouble estimating how many 
pounds gallons gallons
grapes are needed the data shown in table 14 provides a 

of of red of 
reasonable basis for making fruit estimates home winemakers often 

white
get about 150 gallons per ton for red wines however white grapes 

grapes wine wine 
are more difficult to press than red pomace and white grapes are particularly difficult to handle with a vertical basket press 
100 7 6
consequently most home winemakers only get 120 to 130 gallons of 
200 15 13
white juice per ton of grapes the values shown in table 14 were 
300 22 19
calculated based on a yield of 150 gallons for red wine and 125 
400 30 25
gallons for white juice experienced winemakers always produce 
500 37 31
extra wine for topping up storage containers 
600 45 38
 700 52 44
 800 60 50
containers 
900 67 56 1000 75 63
a variety of containers are needed for winemaking boxes or other 
2000 150 125 
shallow containers are used to transport grapes from the vineyard to 
table 14 typical wine yields when a
the winemaking area open containers are used for mixing and for 
small basket press is used 
red fermentations closed containers are used for fermenting white juice and for storing and aging wine 
stainless steel is the material of choice for wine storage containers because it is inert cleans easy and lasts for many years unfortunately small stainless steel tanks suitable for wine storage 
 are very expensive so containers made of glass polyethylene and wood are often used surplus beer kegs are an exception and many home winemakers use stainless steel beer kegs for wine storage 
bulk grape containers 
standard 2 ton gondolas measure 96 inches long by 48 inches wide by 48 inches high a 1 ton tank measures about 48 x 48 x 48 inches a fruit bin measuring 48 inches by 48 inches by 22 inches will hold about 1000 pounds of grapes 
a 48 inch x 32 inch x 24 inch box will hold about 650 pounds of grapes and standard 32 gallon plastic trash cans hold about 135 pounds 
 when lined with trash bags plastic milk crates hold 35 or 40 pounds of grapes round 5 gallon plastic buckets hold 22 to 24 pounds 
bulk containers are usually not needed when home winemakers purchase grapes by the ton large quantities of grapes can be hauled easily 
 by lining the bed of a pickup truck with a sheet of 4 mil polyethylene the fruit is dumped directly into the bed of the truck 
open fermenters 
many home winemakers use 32 gallon plastic trash cans for fermenting red wine plastic trash cans are inexpensive and light 
 weight open red fermenters should only be filled to 80 percent of capacity to prevent over flowing so 32 gallon trash 
 cans can ferment about 230 pounds of crushed grapes almost 400 pounds of crushed grapes can be fermented in a 55 gallon polyethylene drum with the head removed and a plastic half ton bin will ferment about 1400 pounds of crushed grapes 
beer kegs 
surplus stainless steel beer kegs make excellent wine storage containers modern beer kegs hold 15 5 gallons and they are readily available beer kegs cost 
 about a dollar a gallon stainless steel beer kegs are easy to clean and they last forever a #11 stopper or a silicone bung can be used to seal beer kegs 
oak barrels 
wine barrels are made in two standard sizes 200 liters and 225 liters two hundred liter barrels hold approximately 52 gallons and 225 liter barrels 
 hold about 59 gallons most american made barrels hold 52 gallons and most french barrels hold 59 gallons half barrels hold 25 to 30 gallons 
bungs 
some winemakers place small pieces of cloth or burlap under wooden bungs although popular such an arrangement allows considerable air to enter the barrel and this technique should not be used for quality table wine production 
 although more expensive silicone rubber bungs are much better than old fashion wood bungs rubber bungs seal the barrels tightly and they are easy to remove best of all they do not deform the bung holes in expensive barrels 
container case capacity 
five gallon glass carboys contain two cases of wine full 15 5 gallon beer kegs hold six cases a 27­gallon polyethylene drum holds about 11 cases a 52 gallon barrel 
 holds 22 cases of wine and a 59 gallon barrel holds 24 cases a 165 gallon polyethylene tank holds about 68 cases and a 1000 gallon tank contains 415 cases 
sanitation 
maintaining sanitary conditions in the home winery entails more than just hosing down the garage floor sanitation activities include washing 
 old bottles cleaning the equipment disposing of pomace controlling ants and fruit flies keeping winemaking and storage areas clean etc etc 
wash equipment before and after use 
washing the winemaking equipment just before use is necessary for good sanitation washing the equipment immediately after use saves 
 the winemaker a great deal of time grape residues are easy to wash away when wet but dried residues are very difficult to remove 
spray nozzle 
a hose equipped with a good spray nozzle is a necessity in the crush area the nozzle should produce a fine spray and a solid stream the hose and nozzle will be dropped from time to time 
 so the nozzle should be well designed and constructed of strong materials hang the hose from a hook conveniently placed in the crush area because the hose and nozzle will be used often 
hoses 
transfer hoses can remain wet for long periods and then mildew can grow on the inside surfaces hoses should be washed immediately after use and hung on a wall with both ends down and the hoses will drain completely full strength 
 clorox will remove mold and other stains from the inside surfaces of hoses or other difficult to reach places however surfaces treated with clorox must be rinsed carefully use clorox with care and do not breathe the fumes 
dirty bottles 
dirty wine bottles usually contain mold yeast and a variety of bacteria dirty bottles are always a potential source of contamination and home winemakers should not store 
 dirty bottles in the winemaking area the bottles should be washed as they are collected then the clean bottles should be stored upside down in clean cardboard cases 
liquid dish washing detergents are difficult to rinse away when used for washing old wine bottles and they can leave unsightly water spots a cup of automatic dishwasher powder in 
 three gallons of very hot water cleans bottles well and the residue rinses cleanly a teaspoon of liquid detergent should be added to the dishwasher powder if the water is hard 
power bottle brush 
most bottle brushes have a loop on the end of the wine handle some home winemakers remove the loop and chuck the wine handle in an electric drill 
 this power bottle brush will remove stubborn bottle residues quickly however this method must be used with care and only with low drill speeds 
jet bottle washer 
a jet carboy washer attached to a water facet or hose is a great convenience for washing old wine bottles these washers are made 
 of brass and they last for many years the washers are inexpensive and they save much time and large amounts of hot water 
auto wheel brush 
brushes with long handles can be purchased in large automotive supply stores these stiff bristled brushes are used for washing auto hub caps and wheels but home winemakers find them 
 handy for scrubbing all kinds of winemaking equipment the long handles make these brushes particularly useful for scrubbing the inside surfaces of small fermenters and tanks 
fermentation techniques 
this section contains practical information and several suggestions on how to cope with some common problems encountered during primary fermentation 
under ripe grapes 
trying to make a dry red table wine from under ripe grapes is seldom successful when under ripe fruit is used wine flavor and bouquet will be lacking 
 and wine color will be poor most red grape varieties are not ripe until the sugar level reaches 22½ to 23½ brix unfortunately home winemakers 
 often have little control over when their grapes are picked and under ripe fruit is often encountered most under ripe red grapes are best 
 used to make blush wines the low alcohol content skimpy flavors and the high acid levels are more appropriate for light fruity blush wine 
white grapes are not ripe until the sugar level reaches about 22 brix and chardonnay grapes are often picked well above 23 brix riesling grapes on the other hand are usually picked at low brix values before 
 they lose their greenish color overripe white grapes are often best used for producing dessert wines at the other extreme under ripe white grapes can be used to produce excellent sparkling wines 
adding sugar to under ripe grapes seldom produces high quality wine the sugar increases the alcohol content but the added sugar does nothing to improve the poor color the puny flavors or the lack of 
 varietal intensity sugared wines are usually too alcoholic pale colored and under flavored in addition under ripe red grapes often produce wine with unpleasant green or vegetal characteristics 
sulfur dioxide 
making and aging high quality table wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult and most winemakers add small quantities 
 of sulfur dioxide when the grapes are crushed about 1/2 level teaspoon of sulfite powder for every 100 pounds of grapes is the right amount 
practically all of the free sulfur dioxide disappears during fermentation so winemakers add 1/4 level teaspoons of sulfite powder for every five 
 gallons of wine when fermentation is complete this quantity of sulfite powder will add about 40 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to the 
 new wine however about half the sulfur dioxide will combine with other materials in the wine quickly so only 20 30 milligrams per liter of free 
 sulfur dioxide remains in the new wine the sulfite powder should be dissolved in an ounce or two of water before it is added to the wine 
wine should always be tested just before bottling time and the free sulfur dioxide content should be adjusted to about 25 milligrams 
 per liter wines bottled with less than 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide oxidize quickly and they 
 are short lived table 15 shows how much sulfite powder is needed to produce 25 50 and 75 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide 
 in various quantities of wine the values given are in grams for example table 15 shows that 5 8 grams of sulfite powder 
gals 25 50 75
 of mg/l mg/l mg/l wine so2 so2 so2
produce 50 milligrams per liter of so2 in 15 gallons of wine 
hydrogen sulfide 
1 0 2 0 4 0 6
 2 0 4 0 8 1 2
all wine yeasts produce small quantities of hydrogen sulfide gas 
3 0 6 1 2 1 8
 rotten egg smell during fermentation but under normal conditions 
4 0 8 1 6 2 4
 5 0 9 1 8 2 7
the quantities produced are very small and of little consequence 
10 1 8 3 6 5 4
the primary cause of excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide is 
15 2 9 5 8 8 7
elemental sulfur on the grapes sulfur is used to control mildew in 
20 3 8 7 6 11 4
vineyards and sometimes excessive amounts of sulfur remains on

sulfide some types of wine yeasts produce more hydrogen sulfide than others montrachet yeast is a particularly bad offender and it 
table 15 grams of sulfite 
should not be used with grapes containing sulfur residues 
powder needed to produce 25 50 and 75 mg/l of so2 
besides the sulfur problem yeast often produces objectionable quantities of hydrogen sulfide gas when the grapes lack nitrogen micro nutrients or vitamins commercial wineries and some home winemakers added small quantities 
 of yeast nutrients and a substance called pantothenic acid to fermentations specifically to reduce the production of hydrogen sulfide pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased at any drugstore 
crushing by hand 
a mechanical crusher is not necessary for making red wine several hundred pounds of fruit can be crushed in a few hours using the following technique 1 put a clean plastic milk crate on a clean plastic trash can 
 2 put a few pounds of grapes in the crate 3 scrub the grapes through the holes in the bottom of the crate into the trash can 4 remove the stems from the crate 5 add a few more pounds 
 of fruit and repeat some grapes will not be crushed but whole grapes are not a problem the juice from the uncrushed grapes will be recovered when the fermentation is pressed 
punching down 
a handy gadget for punching down small fermentations can be made quickly with a few hand tools find a small block of wood and an old broom stick a 6 x 6 x 12 inch piece of wood is fine the exact size is 
 not important bore a hole in the middle of the wood block apply glue and insert the broom stick the new puncher downer will be easier to keep clean if it is finished with three or four coats of varnish 
skin contact time
most of the red pigment and fruit flavors are extracted during the first few days of skin contact four or five days of skin 
 contact are enough to produce a quality product when the grapes are ripe tannins continue to be extracted for many days 
cooling hot fermentations 
fermentations can become violent when warm red grapes are fermented in hot weather much heat is produced and yeast cells can die when fermentation temperatures exceed 90 degrees for 
 several hours such conditions require prompt action and fermentation temperature must be reduced quickly stainless steel containers can be cooled easily by flowing cold water 
 over the outside surfaces sometimes small wineries use blocks of dry ice to cool hot fermentations home winemakers often fill plastic milk containers with clean water and keep the 
 containers in their freezer later the sealed containers of ice can be placed in hot fermentations to reduce the temperature all winemakers try to avoid fermenting hot fruit 
completing fermentation 
fermentation may be complete when three conditions are met first check if the bubbling has stopped and make sure the wine is still and quiet second 
 make sure the hydrometer reads less than zero brix third measure the brix for several days and be sure the hydrometer reading remains constant 
beginning winemakers often have trouble deciding when fermentation has finished the above procedure is useful but the only way to be sure fermentation has finished is to measure the residual sugar in the wine clinitest tablets can be 
 purchased at most large drugstores and these tablets are a very convenient way of measuring small quantities of sugar in wine use the 5 drop method when the sugar content measures less than 1/4 percent the wine is considered dry

divorce lawyer lawyers ex slept sleeping sleep sprung anymore rocker recline recliner replace repalcement
short range hydrometers 
 plus and minus five short range hydrometers are very useful for monitoring sugar content near the end of fermentation these hydrometers have a special scale zero brix is in 
 the center of the scale and plus five degrees and minus five degrees run in each direction from the zero point the scale is large and 0 1 degree brix can be read easily 
cellar techniques 
cellar operations start when fermentation is complete and continues until the wine is released cellar operations include clarification stabilization bulk aging etc 
hot and cold stabilization 
all white and blush wines should be both hot and cold stabilized before bottling many winemakers use the following technique to accomplish both stabilization steps in a single operation three teaspoons 
 of dry bentonite and a cup of hot water are used for each 5 gallons of wine the water is placed in the blender and the blender is run at high speed while the bentonite is added slowly the bentonite 
 mixture is chilled in a refrigerator for 24 hours and then the mixture is stirred into the wine after the bentonite addition the wine is placed in a refrigerator and the temperature control is set 
 to the coldest position after a couple of weeks in the refrigerator the cold wine is racked into a clean container bubbling and splashing should be minimized because cold wine oxidizes easily 
gelatin 
gelatins are useful for fining astringent red wines and a suitable gelatin can be found in the canning section of most grocery 
 stores knox gelatin comes in a box containing four handy pre measured envelopes be sure to buy an un flavored gelatin 
power stirring tool 
small wine containers can be mixed easily with a clean wooden dowel however stirring a barrel or small tank of wine is not so easy and a special stirring tool can 
 be very helpful a variety of stirring tools can be purchased or a propeller type stirrer can be made easily first form a small propeller by cutting and bending a 
 piece of stainless steel sheet drill a hole in the center of the propeller blade and bolt the blade to a 36 inch length of 1/4 inch stainless steel rod secure the 
 propeller with two stainless steel nuts and washers a barrel of wine or a small tank can be quickly mixed with the homemade stirrer and a small electric drill 
oak chips 
many home winemakers add oak chips to red wines stored in glass plastic or stainless containers about 2 oz of oak chips for every 10 gallons of wine is a 
 good starting quantity the chips can be placed in a nylon bag and suspended in the wine or the chips can be added directly to the container after the 
 chips are added the wine should be tasted twice a month to make sure the wine does not get too oakey when the wine has the desired oak character remove 
 the bag of chips or rack the wine off the loose chips into a clean container if more oak character is wanted additional chips can be added anytime 
wine filter 
inexpensive but effective wine filters can be made from standard 10 inch cartridge type water filters these filters are available at hardware stores and a variety of 
 cartridges are manufactured to fit these standard housings five micron water filter cartridges are available at hardware stores these cartridges are inexpensive 
 and they are useful for rough filtering large quantities of wine however a 5 micron cartridge is quite porous and will not completely clarify dirty wine one micron 
 cartridges are used for general clarification and many home winemakers use cartridges with 0 5 or 0 2 micron ratings for filtering wine at bottling time 
wine filter use 
all filter media should be washed before any wine is filtered first completely assemble the filter system and then flush the system with several gallons of clean 
 water the water coming out of the filter should be tasted to make sure no paper taste remains if the rinse water tastes clean the filter is drained and used 
washing is continued if the water has a paper taste some winemakers prefer to wash the complete filter system with a 1 percent citric acid solution the citric acid seems to remove the paper taste quickly and the acid helps 
 sterilize the filter after the acid solution is removed the filter system is washed with clean water a short length of plastic tubing permanently attached to a hose connector is handy for flushing small filters 
storing used filter cartridges 
used filter cartridges are difficult to maintain but the following method works well immediately after use the filter should be back flushed with 
 several gallons of clean water then the water is drained and the housing is filled with a 50% ethyl alcohol solution inexpensive 100 proof 
 vodka the inlet and outlet of the housing should be tightly sealed with small rubber stoppers and the filter should be stored in a cool dry 
 place when the filter is needed drain the alcohol and flush the housing with clean water set the alcohol aside so it can be reused later 
bottling 
bottling is the last major step in the winemaking process lots of things can go wrong so bottling is a difficult operation for many home winemakers ways of avoiding several common bottling problems are discussed below 
bottling supplies 
in 1997 sealed bags of one thousand number one wine corks sold for about 135 the cost of new glass ranged from 4 50 to 6 50 
 per case and re sterilized glass sold for 3 50 to 4 50 a case a carton of 4800 fancy heat shrink capsules sold for 130 
handling bottles 
plastic milk crates are a convenient way of handling wine bottles plastic crates are handy containers for washing used bottles and for filling bottles these crates are strong enough 
 to hold full bottles easily milk crates are easy to keep clean and they are always handy to have in any home winery standard size plastic milk crates hold about 20 bottles 
softening corks 
hard corks can be softened by soaking in cold water for a few hours excessive cork water is undesirable because the water stains the top of the corks and makes a mess after 
 soaking the excess water should be poured off then the container of corks should be covered with a clean cloth and the corks should be allowed to drain overnight 
old corks can be softened quickly in a microwave oven rinse the corks in cold water and then seal the wet corks in a plastic freezer bag heat the bag of 
 corks in a microwave oven for a short time a bag containing 50 corks might require a one minute exposure at a 50 percent power setting however the 
 time depends on the microwave oven and some experimentation may be needed corks burn easily so always use the minimum power and time necessary the 
 intense microwave energy may also be effective in sterilizing the corks please note this technique should not be used with paraffin coated corks 
bottle filling 
always avoid oxidation by not splashing or bubbling the wine when bottles are filled small pressure heads reduce bubbling so the 
 wine container should be just two or three feet higher than the bottles bottles should be filled from the bottom slowly until 
 no more than 1/4 inch gap remains between the wine and the bottom of the cork the small pressure head increases time needed to 
 fill the bottles however filling time can be reduced significantly by using a large 1/2 inch diameter wand type bottle filler 
making labels 
inexpensive labels can be made easily with a home computer a variety of art work can be included and professional quality 
 labels can be produced easily if a scanner and color printer are available most light weight papers wrinkle badly when 
 the glue is applied but many medium weight bond papers are suitable for labels four six or eight labels should be made from standard 8 5 x 11 inch sheets of paper and very little paper will be wasted if the layout is done carefully 
label paster 
small wineries use a label pasting machine when small lots are labeled by hand these handy machines quickly apply just the right amount of glue to the back surface 
 of any label unfortunately these little machines sell for several hundred dollars and most home winemakers do not produce enough wine to justify the cost 
gluing labels by hand 
white elmers glue is often a satisfactory adhesive for applying labels printed on heavy weight paper use a wide short bristled brush to apply glue to the back of the labels pasting is easier when a piece of stiff cardboard 
 smaller than the label is used the label is placed face down on the cardboard and then the glue is applied with the brush a glue stick is a very convenient adhesive when only a few bottles are being labeled 
summary 
some winemaking procedures are done only once each year so several crush seasons are needed for novice winemakers to develop certain skills beginning winemakers can learn basic winemaking techniques 
 and get many useful ideas by visiting other home winemakers or small commercial wineries and visiting other winemakers is always an enjoyable way to gain practical information quickly 
chapter 23 

laboratory wine testing 
about 30 tons of grapes are required to make 5000 gallons of wine high quality fruit might cost 1500 per ton so the grapes needed to fill a 5000 gallon 
 tank can cost 45 000 losing a tank of wine can be very expensive so commercial winemakers depend on laboratory wine measurements to minimize 
 the number of gross wine failures laboratory measurements also help winemakers produce wines more consistent in style and quality from year to year 
 consequently laboratory measurements are indispensable in commercial wineries and they play an important role in most home winemaking programs 
large wineries maintain extensive in house laboratory facilities containing much expensive equipment on the other hand many small wineries cannot afford extensive measurement facilities because the equipment 
 is too expensive most small wineries rely on basic wine tests that can be done with a minimum amount of apparatus and they depend on the winemakers nose to provide much of the needed information 
noses can detect and identify extremely small quantities of many different materials so noses are wonderful measurement tools for quickly determining the condition 
 of wine noses are always available unless the winemaker has a cold and an educated nose is the most valuable measurement tool any winemaker possesses 
the equipment and methods for doing six basic wine measurements are discussed below 
brix 
sugar in juice or wine is measured using the brix scale this scale was developed specifically for winemaking and one degree brix is 
 equal to one gram of sugar per 100 grams of juice winemakers usually measure brix with an optical refractometer or a hydrometer 
sugar content is one of several criteria used to judge fruit maturity and most grapes are picked when the sugar content is between 20 and 25 
 brix winemakers start measuring grape sugars several weeks before harvest time and they continue sugar testing until the fruit is picked 
taking hydrometer readings during fermentation is important most winemakers measure brix at least once each day to monitor the speed and consistence of their fermentations 
 moderate drops in sugar each day shows normal fermentation if an unusual change in sugar level is observed the winemaker can make corrections promptly 
novice winemakers often believe fermentation is complete when their hydrometers measure zero 
however alcohol has a density less than water so hydrometers read less than zero brix when a completely dry wine is measured dry white 
 table wines usually measure 1 8 to 2 4 brix and dry red table wines measure 1 4 to 2 2 brix because of the accumulated alcohol 
brix measurement materials 
sugar can be accurately measured using inexpensive 20 short range brix hydrometers many winemakers use a set of three instruments one instrument 
 reads from 16 to 24 degrees brix the second instrument reads from 8 to 16 degrees and the third hydrometer reads + 5 to 5 brix all three 
 hydrometers are calibrated in 0 1 brix steps some home winemakers rely on a single hydrometer with a zero to 30 degree brix scale these long 
 range instruments are inexpensive and readily available unfortunately these long range hydrometers are difficult to read accurately 
the following materials are needed to measure the sugar content of juice 
brix hydrometers 
a hydrometer cylinder 

brix measurement procedure 
hydrometers are made from very thin glass they are fragile and these instruments must be handled carefully the following procedure can be used to measure brix in juice 
1 strain un clarified juice to remove the solids 
2 fill the hydrometer cylinder within a few inches of the top with juice 
3 gently lower the hydrometer in the liquid and give it a slight twist motion the twist will release any bubbles sticking to the glass 
4 when the hydrometer is floating freely wait a few seconds and then read the hydrometer scale read the scale in line with the bottom of the meniscus curve 
5 record the reading 
6 discard the sample and rinse the cylinder and hydrometer with clean water 

titratable acid 
titratable acid ta is a measure of the sum of all the organic acids in juice or wine in healthy wine the major acids are tartaric and malic 
 but all wines contain small quantities of citric succinic acetic butyric lactic and other organic acids in the united states wine acidity 
 is expressed as if all of the acids in the wine were tartaric acid the titratable acid of juice ranges from 0 4 to 1 2 grams per 100 milliliters 
 of liquid one hundred milliliters of juice weighs approximately 100 grams so grams per 100 ml is roughly equal to percent 
the tart of wine is strongly related to titratable acid when wine contains too much acid it will be very tart or even sour tasting 
 when too little acid is present wine often lacks freshness and tastes flat grapes grown in warm areas are usually low in 
 acid and additions of tartaric acid are often needed to produce a balanced wine ta is always measured when the grapes are crushed 
 so any needed acid adjustments can be made before fermentation is started ta is also used to judge fruit maturity at 
 harvest time the titratable acid of normal wine slowly decreases as the wine ages and any rise in wine ta during the aging period 
 is a danger signal to the winemaker when the ta rises acetic acid may be forming and the wine may be turning into vinegar 
 therefore most winemakers measure titratable acid periodically from the time fermentation is complete until the wine is bottled 
 small producers often measure titratable acid once each month but many large producers measure the ta twice a month 
titratable acid of wine or juice can be measured by several different analytical techniques however most wineries use a titration method this measurement procedure is simple and the laboratory apparatus is inexpensive 
acid measurement materials 
titratable acid can be measured by a simple titration procedure using a calibrated 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution phenolphthalein solution is used as an indicator to show the titration end point 
the following materials are needed to measure the titratable acid of white wine blush wine and juice 
5 ml serological transfer pipette 
10 ml serological transfer pipette 
250 ml erlenmeyer flask 

0 1 normal sodium hydroxide 
1% phenolphthalein solution 
distilled water 

titratable acid measurement procedure 
this procedure is satisfactory for measuring the titratable acid of juices and white or blush wines 
1 draw 5 milliliters ml of juice or wine into the 5 ml pipette 
2 transfer the sample into the flask 
3 add about 50 ml of distilled water and three or four drops of phenolphthalein solution 
4 fill the 10 ml pipette with 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution 
5 titrate with the sodium hydroxide while mixing the wine sample by rocking the flask 
6 stop titration when the sample turns a faint pink 
7 record the quantity of sodium hydroxide solution used 
8 rinse the flask and pipettes with clean water 

titratable acid calculations 
titratable acid can be calculated using the following formula 
a ta % 0 15 x milliliters of sodium hydroxide used 
in the above formula the titratable acid is given in grams of acid per 100 ml of wine percent and ta is 
expressed as if all of the acids in the wine were tartaric acid 
two examples of how titratable acid is calculated from the measured data follow 

example # 1 
a white wine sample was titrated drop by drop during titration the sample was mixed by rocking the flask from side to side a faint but persistent pink color was reached and the pipette scale was read in this example the scale 
 showed 5 3 ml of sodium hydroxide had been added to the sample the titratable acid of the sample was calculated by multiplying 0 15 times 5 3 this gave a ta of 0 79 grams of acid per 100 milliliters of wine or 0 79 percent 
example # 2 
a pipette was used to add 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution to a red wine sample the titration was done slowly so the stir bar could keep the sample mixed and the ph meter was carefully watched titration was 
 stopped when the meter read 8 2 the pipette scale was read and it showed 3 9 ml of sodium hydroxide had been added to the sample the acidity of the red wine sample was calculated by multiplying 0 15 times 
3 9 which give 0 58 grams per 100 milliliters 0 58 percent an alternative 
procedure for red wines 
the above procedure does not work well for dark red wines because the end point is very difficult to recognize in dark red wines diluting red wine samples with up to 200 milliliters of water makes the measurement 
 easier but most winemakers prefer to use the following procedure when testing dark red wines however a ph meter ring stand and a magnetic stirrer are required for this procedure see ph measurement below 
1 place the probe in a ring stand clamp and arrange the stand so the probe is centered above the stirrer plate 
2 draw 5 milliliters ml of wine into the pipette and transfer it into the beaker 
3 add about 50 ml of distilled water and place the stir bar in the beaker 
4 place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the ring stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe 
5 turn the stirrer on 
6 fill the pipette with 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution 7 titrate the wine sample while watching the ph meter 
8 stop the titration when the ph meter reads 8 2 
8 
record the quantity of sodium hydroxide used 
9 
discard the wine sample and rinse the probe beaker stir bar and the pipettes several times with clean water 

free sulfur dioxide 
winemakers try to maintain 20 to 40 milligrams per liter of free so2 in their wine from the completion of fermentation until the wine is bottled but the amount of free so2 does not remain constant sulfur dioxide is consumed as it does its 
 job and the free sulfur dioxide slowly decreases with time consequently winemakers measure the free sulfur dioxide in their wines every few weeks and they make appropriate additions to maintain the sulfur dioxide near the desired level 
so2 measurement materials 
5 ml serological pipette 
10 ml serological pipette 
250 ml clear glass container 
dilute sulfuric acid 1 part acid in 3 parts water 
1% starch solution 

0 01 n iodine solution 
distilled water 

the starch indicator solution is made by mixing one half teaspoon of corn starch in about 200 ml of water and boiling the mixture for a few minutes the starch solution can 
 be used when it is cool but a fresh solution should be made every week or so starch solutions are prepared commercially and these solutions last for several months 
a 0 01 normal iodine solution is a weak solution and weak iodine solutions are not stable weak iodine solutions should be stored in dark brown glass bottles 
 and the bottle should be tightly stoppered and stored in a dark place even then the calibration normality of the iodine solution will change slowly 
free so2 measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to measure the amount of free sulfur dioxide in juice or wine 
1 draw exactly 10 milliliters ml of wine into the pipette and transfer the wine into a small clear glass container 
2 add about 5 ml of diluted sulfuric acid h2so4 to the wine sample 
3 add 2 or 3 ml of the starch solution to the sample 
4 immediately fill the 5 ml pipette with the iodine solution and titrate the wine sample until a faint purple color is reached this is the end point the purple color will fade in a few seconds but do not add more iodine 
5 record the quantity of iodine solution used to reach the end point 
6 rinse the pipettes and the glass container several times in clean water and place them in drying racks 

most commercial wineries routinely use the iodine method to measure sulfur dioxide in white and blush wines however this method is not very accurate when used with red wines because phenolic 
 materials in red wines also react with the iodine these side reactions can give erroneously high results and measured values of free sulfur dioxide can be more than 20 percent too high 
besides the side reactions the end point is difficult to recognize in dark red wines generally a distinct purple color does not occur when red wines are titrated instead 
 a slight darkening of the wine color indicates the end point diluting red wine with distilled water often makes the end point easier to recognize and as much 
 as 150 ml of water is sometimes used viewing the diluted red wine with a strong yellow sidelight is often helpful some winemakers have a 75 watt yellow bug light 
 in a desk lamp specifically for measuring sulfur dioxide in red wines measuring sulfur dioxide in dark red wines with the iodine method requires some practice 
sulfur dioxide calculations 
the amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine sample is calculated from the measured volume of the iodine solution used in the titration and from the normality of the iodine the formula for free so2 can be written as 
so2 3200 x volume of iodine x normality of iodine 
in the above formula the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine sample is given in milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine mg/l 
two examples of how free sulfur dioxide is calculated from the measured data are given below 
example # 1 
a faint purple color was produced when 2 2 milliliters of 0 01 n iodine solution was added to 10 milliliters of white wine the free so2 level of this wine was obtained by multiplying 3200 
 times 2 2 the quantity of iodine solution times 0 01 the normality of the iodine solution the multiplication 3200 x 2 2 x 01 gives 70 4 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide 
example # 2 
a dark red wine sample was diluted with about 100 milliliters of distilled water when 1 2 ml of 0 01 n iodine solution was added to the wine sample the color darkened slightly 
 the free so2 level of this red wine was calculated by multiplying 3200 times 1 2 times 0 01 this measurement gave 38 4 milligrams per liter mg/l of free sulfur dioxide 
ph 
ph is one of several parameters used to judge fruit maturity and most winemakers start monitoring the ph of the grapes several weeks before harvest time ph also 
 gives the winemaker important information about how much sulfur dioxide is needed to control microbes wine stability characteristics are dependent on ph 
red wine color is influenced by ph red wines with low ph values have more and better red color wines with high ph values have a dull less attractive color winemakers monitor wine ph every few weeks until the wine is bottled 
ph measurement materials 
a ph meter with a three digit resolution is the only practical way of measuring ph and an instrument with a separate probe on a 36 inch cable 
 is a great convenience for wine measurements all ph meters should be calibrated just before use and most instruments have long warm up times 
ph meter 
ph probe 

7 00 standard ph solution 
4 00 standard ph solution 
100 ml beaker 
ring stand 
magnetic stirrer 
stir bar 

ph measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to measure the ph of any wine must or juice 
1 place the probe in the ring stand clamp and arrange the stand so the probe is centered above the stirrer plate 
2 place 30 or 40 milliliters of the 7 00 standard solution in the beaker 
3 place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe turn the stirrer on 
4 adjust the calibration knob until the meter reads 7 00 
5 discard the standard solution and rinse the beaker 
6 place 30 or 40 milliliters of the 4 00 standard solution in the beaker 
7 place the beaker on the stirrer plate and adjust the stand so probe is emersed do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe turn the stirrer on 
8 adjust the slope knob until the meter reads 4 00 
9 discard the standard solution and rinse the beaker 
10 place 30 or 40 milliliters of wine or juice in the beaker 
11 place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe turn on the stirrer 
12 wait a few seconds then read the ph meter and record the value 
13 rinse the probe beaker and stir bar in clean water 

residual sugar 
fermentation can restart in wine containing sugar anytime so winemakers always measure the residual sugar contents of their wines shortly after fermentation 
 to be sure no sugar remains large wineries use a wet chemistry method but small wineries and home winemakers use clinitest tablets to measure 
 residual sugars in wine this measurement method is simple and it provides reasonable accuracy when the residual sugar content is less than about 2 
 percent clinitest tablets are sold in most large drugstores tablets and a special color chart can also be ordered from winemaking supply companies 
residual sugar measurement materials 
the following equipment can be used to measure the residual sugar content of any table wine 
eye dropper 
small clear container 
clinitest tablets 
clinitest color chart 
residual sugar measurement procedure 
this procedure can be used to measure the residual sugar content in any wine containing less than 2 percent sugar wines with higher values of sugar can be 
 measured by diluting the wine appropriately measurements are made by comparing the color of a treated wine sample to the color on a calibrated chart 
 however the color pigments in red wines do not seem to cause significant errors 
directions and a color chart are provided with the clinitest tablets 
1 draw a small amount of wine into the eye dropper 
2 place 5 drops of wine in the clear container 
3 rinse the eye dropper carefully several times with clean water 
4 draw a small amount of distilled water into the eye dropper 
5 place 10 drops of distilled water in the clear container 
6 place one clinitest tablet in the container 
7 after the boiling stops wait 15 seconds then read the sugar content by comparing the color of the liquid to the colors on the chart 
8 rinse the eye dropper and the small container several times with clean water 

clinitest tablets are sensitive to moisture so the bottle should be kept tightly sealed 
chromatography 
most winemakers measure the malic acid content of their red wines when fermentation is complete they want to know ml fermentation is complete and if all the malic acid is gone an additional 
 treatment may be needed to stabilize the wine when malic acid remains and paper chromatography is a simple and reliable means of determining what kinds of organic acids are present in wine 
yeasts produce small quantities of lactic acid during primary fermentation so all wine contains some lactic acid therefore the progress of ml fermentations should be 
 judged by the disappearance of malic acid not by the appearance of lactic acid ml fermentation is considered finished when the malic acid spot completely disappears 
ml chromatography materials 
the following materials are needed to measure ml fermentation status in any wine 
a 1 gallon wide mouthed jar 
ml solvent 
ml paper 
micro pipettes capillary tubes 
standard malic acid solution 

ml measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to identify and estimate the quantities of tartaric citric malic and lactic acids in wine or juice 
1 place a sheet of chromatography paper on a clean surface use clean hands and try to hold the paper by its edges 
2 make a light pencil line along a long side about 3/4 inches up from the bottom and then make marks about 1 1/4 inches apart along the pencil line label each mark 
 either as the malic acid standard or for each of the wine samples being measured the first mark on the left is commonly used for the malic acid standard 
3 use capillary tubes to draw up a small quantity of the acid standard and wine samples do not allow any contact between the tubes 
4 touch the end of each tube to the mark on the line very quickly the wet spots should not be larger than about 1/4 inch in diameter 
5 allow the spots to dry and then repeat the above step twice 3 applications let the dots dry between each application 
6 pour enough ml solution into the wide mouthed jar to cover the bottom the solvent should cover about 1/8 inch of the bottom edge of the paper the solvent should not come up to the pencil line 
7 when all of the dots are completely dry staple the short sides of the paper together forming a cylinder 
8 stand the paper cylinder upright in the jar with the pencil line near the bottom and place the cover on the jar 
9 let the jar stand until the solvent front has climbed nearly to the top of the paper six or more hours 
10 remove the paper from the jar pour the ml solvent back into the original container wash and dry the jar and discard the capillary tubes 

remove the staples from the sheet of paper and hang the paper in a well ventilated place the chromatogram can be read when the paper is completely dry

step by step winemaking 
in southern california the annual grape crushes usually starts in mid august and ends in early october many factors influence grape ripening time including grape variety temperature soils irrigation practice sun light etc 
fruit 
 wine quality is made in the vineyard and high quality wine can only be made from quality fruit 
when grapes are picked too early the wine may be high in acid low in alcohol and lack fruit flavors and 
aromas 
when grapes are picked too late the wine is often low in acid high in alcohol and has stewed fruit raisin or 
prune flavors 
 second crop fruit often makes poor quality wine 
professional winemakers get 150 to 180 gallons per ton but home winemakers seldom get more than 140 
to 150 gallons 
bulk wine containers must be topped up regularly and kept completely full so winemakers always produce 
extra wine 

nominal sugar levels
 17 to 19 brix for sparkling wine 
 19 to 22 brix for blush and light white wines 
 22 to 24 brix for chardonnay and sauvignon blanc 
 23 to 25 brix for most red wines 

grape processing 
grapes can deteriorate quickly on a hot day 
boxes of picked grapes should not be left in the hot sun 
grapes should be moved to the winemaking area quickly 
winemakers prefer fruit picked early in the morning when the grapes are cold 

crusher 
for most home winemakers a hand crank crusher is the most practical method of crushing fruit both single and double roller crushers work well 
good machines crank easily but poorly designed and poorly constructed machines do not power crusher/stemmers crush the grapes and remove the stems in one simple fast operation removing 
 the stems from white grapes is not necessary if the grapes will be pressed immediately stems can be removed from red fermentations by hand using the following technique 
 1 place a clean plastic milk crate on top of a clean plastic trash can 
 2 place a few pounds of crushed fruit in the bottom of the milk crate and use a scrubbing motion 
 3 the crushed fruit will drop through the crate 
 4 discard the stems from the crate and repeat the process 

sulfur dioxide so2 
making quality table wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult 
sulfur dioxide helps control native yeast and bacteria 
sulfur dioxide also reduces oxidation of the must and wine 
usually about 35 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide is added when the grapes are crushed 
one half level teaspoon of sulfite powder in 100 pounds of grapes is the correct amount 
the sulfite should be dissolved in a small amount of water and then stirred into the crushed grapes 

press 
small quantities of red wine can be made without a press but a wine press is necessary to make white wine the following procedure works well with small vertical basket presses 
 1 fill the basket add the top plates blocks and press head 
 2 apply a small amount of pressure until the liquid flows 
 3 when the flow decreases increase the pressure 
 4 excessive foam between the basket slats show pressing is being done too quickly 
 5 when the flow stops disassemble the press crumble the press cake and repress most home winemakers crumble the press cake two or three times when pressing expensive grapes ratchet 
 type basket presses can produce high pressures but high pressures often produce harsh bitter wines moderate pressures are desirable and the fruit should be pressed slowly 
juice and must corrections 
acid content titratable acid strongly influences the taste of the wine 
wine can taste flat and insipid when the acid content is too low 
wine tastes too tart when the acid is too high 
grapes grown in warm areas are often low in titratable acid 
titratable acid should be between 0 65 and 0 85 percent before fermentation 
small quantities of tartaric acid should be added to the must if the acid level is lower than 0 65 percent 
acid crystals should be dissolved in a small amount of water before the acid is added to the must 
stir the must well and then re measure the acid content 
only small amounts of acid should be added at a time 

sugar corrections 
ordinary white table sugar can be used for sugar additions 
low sugar is not a problem in california 
if the sugar content is too low the grapes are not mature 
high quality table wines cannot be made from immature grapes 
grapes lacking sugar should be harvested later in the season when the fruit is fully ripe 

yeast nutrients 
yeast requires nitrogen vitamins and several other materials to reproduce new yeast cells and ferment the 
grape sugars 
grapes deficient in these materials can be difficult to ferment unless extra nutrients are added 
chardonnay juice deficient in nitrogen occurs regularly so winemakers often add extra nitrogen to all 
chardonnay juice 
directions for yeast nutrients should be followed carefully to avoid off flavors in the wine 

settling white juice 
fresher white table wines are produced when bits of skin pulp and other debris is removed from juice 
before fermentation 
when the solids have been removed fermentations are cleaner and better controlled 
juice is often settled over night and then the clear juice is racked off the sediment the next day 
the juice must be kept cold and the proper amount of sulfur dioxide should be used 
sometimes additional clear juice can be obtained by resettling the residue 

fermentation 
grape skins have a waxy coating and the coating is covered with native yeasts 
native yeast can spontaneously ferment grapes without the winemaker adding additional yeast 
sulfur dioxide is used to arrest yeast activity but reasonable quantities will not kill the yeast 
most winemakers prefer to add pure cultured yeast to start fermentation 

cultured yeast 
most home winemakers prefer dry yeast because using it is easier 
some yeasts like epernay does not tolerate high levels of alcohol 
steinberg yeast does not tolerate high levels of sulfur dioxide 
montrachet yeast produces more hydrogen sulfide rotten egg smell than many other yeasts montrachet 
should never be used with grapes containing residual sulfur dust 
pasteur champagne yeast can produce large amounts of foam in warm fermentation 
small wineries often use dry prise de mousse yeast to ferment all of their wines 
the type of yeast used has little impact on the flavor of aged wine 

dry yeast rehydration 
yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry yeast 
dry yeast is rehydrated by adding a small amount of warm water 
about a cup of water should be used for each teaspoon of yeast 
the water temperature should be between 95 and 100 degrees 
after stirring the yeast mixture should stand for 30 minutes 
most winemakers use about one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must or juice 

white fermentations 
fermentation temperature is one of the most important factors for producing quality white table wines 
light fruity white wines like riesling are always fermented at temperatures ranging from 40 to 55 degrees 
at these low temperatures white fermentations often continue for two or three weeks 
heavier style white wines are often fermented at temperatures between 55 and 65 degrees 
white juice should always be settled over night 
only the clarified juice is fermented 
white wines are always fermented in closed containers sealed with a fermentation trap 
all fermentations should be monitored by measuring the brix each day 
when fermentation is complete the new wine should be racked into a clean container and 50 milligrams 
per liter of so2 should be added 

red fermentations 
red grapes have colorless juice 
the color is in the grape skins 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp seeds and skins together for several days 
lengthy skin contact does not increase color but it does increase wine astringency 
short skin contact time produces softer more fruity red wines 
skin contact time is always a compromise and winemaking experience is needed 
usually four to seven days is adequate for red fermentations 
 when in doubt press early is a good rule to follow 
a cap of skins will begin to float after fermentation starts 
if the cap becomes dry vinegar bacteria can grow and convert the alcohol into vinegar 
to prevent this acetification problem the cap should be broken up periodically and kept wet 
caps on small fermentations will not be very thick and small caps can be managed by stirring the 
fermentation twice a day 
on larger fermentations a special tool is needed to punch the cap down into the juice 
caps should be punched down twice a day 
more punching down will do no harm and it may improve the color of the wine 

pressing red must 
red musts are usually pressed in a basket press and the procedure is the same as pressing white juices see above 
small red fermentations can by pressed by hand if the grapes were thoroughly crushed the following procedure works well 
 1 cut a piece of 3/4 inch thick plywood to fit inside a plastic milk crate 
 2 let the cap rise and then the liquid can be carefully siphoned off 
 3 the plastic milk crate is placed on a suitable container and a piece of plastic window screen is placed in the bottom of the crate 
 4 fill the crate half full of pomace and place the plywood on top 
 5 press by hand and then place a heavy weight on the plywood 
 6 let the crate drain for 15 or 20 minutes and then stir the pomace and repeat after pressing red wine should be placed in a closed container and the container should 
 be sealed with a fermentation lock when fermentation is complete the new wine should be racked off the gross lees and 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide added 
cellar operations 
cellar operations include wine clarification stabilization bulk aging bottling and bottle aging 
clarification 
clarification is accomplished by racking fining and filtration 
most white and blush wines will need to be clarified by fining with sparkolloid 
most red wines become clear automatically 
red wines are often fined with protein materials such as a gelatin casein or egg whites to reduce 
astringency 
un flavored knox gelatin purchased at a grocery store can be used to remove red wine astringency 
one level teaspoon of dry gelatin powder for each 5 gallons of wine is an average dose 
the powder should be mixed in a cup of warm water 
the warm gelatin liquid should be added slowly while constantly stirring the wine 
after a week or so the wine should be racked off the fining lees 
a light gelatin fining can be effective in reducing the amount of bottle deposit 

stabilization 
stable wines remain clear after they are bottled 
unstable wines often change color produce hazes or throw ugly sediments after they are bottled 
wine is made stable by fining racking chilling adding sulfur dioxide and aging 
white and blush wines should be hot stabilized with bentonite 
two grams of dry bentonite per gallon of wine are often used but testing should be done 
the wine should be racked a week or so after adding the bentonite 
all white and blush wines should be cold stabilized by chilling the wine to about 28 degrees 
excess tartrate crystals precipitate when wine is chilled 
some wineries do both hot and cold stabilization treatments at one time by adding bentonite and then chilling 
the wine to the low temperature 
after a week or two the cold wine is filtered or racked off the bentonite lees 

white wines are normally racked two or three times before bottling 
red wines should be racked about every month for the first three months then twice a year 
the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine should be maintained at 25 to 30 milligrams per liter 

bulk aging wine 
aging is a natural process and no way has been found to speed up the process 
small amounts of oxygen are always present when wine is aged in the cask 
aging in the bottle takes place in an absence of oxygen 
light white wines and blush wines are usually bottled a few months after harvest 
chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are often bottled after six to 12 months 
most quality red wines are bottled after one to three years of barrel aging 
containers must be kept full and the sulfur dioxide must be maintained at 20 to 30 milligrams per liter 

oak 
oak wood can impart desirable flavors to wine 
oak flavors are best got by storing wine in oak barrels for extended periods 
barrels are expensive and they no longer produce the desirable flavors after four or five years 
oak chips can also produce oak flavors in wine 
the quantity of oak chips needed depends upon the style of the wine and personal preferences 
one to two ounces of chips for 5 gallons of wine is a good starting quantity 
the wine should be tasted every few weeks after the chips are added and the wine should be racked off 
the chips when the taste is satisfactory 
more chips can always be added but removing excess oak flavor from wine is difficult 
most aromatic wines riesling muscat etc do not benefit from oak aging 

bottling 
wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before bottling 
bottling is a simple operation but several points should be considered before the bottles are filled 

adjustments before bottling 
any blending should be done many weeks before bottling time so the winemaker can be sure the new blend 
is stable 
large additions of tartaric acid can make wine unstable and require additional cold stabilization 
usually small amounts of citric acid can be added to white wines without upsetting cold stability 
cold stability should be checked before bottling white or blush wines by placing a wine sample in the 
refrigerator for 48 hours 
hot stability should be checked by holding a sample of the wine at 120 degrees for 48 hours 
the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine should be tested and adjusted to about 30 milligrams per liter a 
day or two before bottling 

wines bottled with less than 30 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide will be short lived 
bottle filling 
clean bottles should be rinsed with very hot water just before filling 
then rinse each bottle with a sulfite solution and drain the bottles 
the sulfur dioxide solution is made by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of sulfite crystals and 2 teaspoon of citric acid in 
750 ml of water 
this sulfite solution is strong enough to kill bacteria but the bottles must be drained carefully 
a bottle filler of some kind should always be used to reduce wine oxidation 
bottles should be filled from the bottom and with a minimum amount of foam and splashing 
bottles should be filled until no more than 1/4 inch exists between the wine and the bottom of the cork 

corking 
driving dry corks is preferred 
some small hand corkers cannot compress dry corks adequately and presoaked corks must be used 
presoak corks in cold water for an hour or so to soften them 
a pinch of sulfite added to the water may help sterilize the corks 
drive corks flush or slightly below the lip of the bottle 
remove spilled wine from the bottles or the wine residue will become moldy 

labeling 
all bottles should have some kind of label to identify the contents 
attractive wine labels can be made with a home computer 
common white glue is often used for attaching wine labels 
a few labels can be applied quickly with a glue stick 
capsules and labels can be applied when the bottles are clean and dry 

bottle aging 
bottles should stand upright for a week or two after corking 
after the pressure has equalized bottles can be stored on their sides or upside down in a cool place 
red wines are usually aged in the bottle for one or more years to develop bottle bouquet 
heavier style white wines also benefit from bottle aging 

summary 
high quality wine can only be made when high quality fruit is picked in optimum condition 
sulfur dioxide should be added to grapes when they are crushed 
juice acidity should be adjusted to 0 65 to 0 85 percent before fermentation is started 
white juice should be settled over night and fermentation temperatures should kept below 60 f 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp seeds and skins together 
caps on red fermentations should be punched down at least twice a day 

four to seven days of fermentation time will be adequate for most red grape varieties 
about 50 milligrams per liter of so2 should be added when fermentation is complete 
wine is made stable by fining racking and chilling 
white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization treatments 
all wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before bottling 
the free so2 level should be raised to about 30 milligrams per liter a day or two before wine is bottled

this wine makers manual is dedicated to the 
government of the united states to all the state governments to the government of the dominion of canada and to the oenological experts of the province of ontario 
the american federal government at no time has done much of anything to help the wine maker either in the way of giving him technical guidance or in finding 
 him foreign markets with two notable exceptions the state governments have done nothing california has taken the lead with marvelous scientific 
 work new york has been of great aid by producing better varieties of wine grapes and has now begun scientific research in wine making included in 
 which are experiments with more than ninety pure wine yeast cultures ontario has begun experimentation to provide better varieties of wine grapes 
with the exception of these two american states and one canadian province practically nothing has been done by constituted authority to help the wine maker the enormously big wineries 
 do not need help except in the finding of foreign markets they have their own laboratories and experts the little ones do need guidance many a writer has said that the small wineries 
 5 
in europe and california produce a superior product governments should help them to reach perfection 
the neglect of the united states to help the wine maker is in sorry contrast with european practice the governments of france germany and italy especially provide scientific research instruction and 
 foreign prop­aganda america can produce as good wine as any other nation on earth and vastly more of it the united states is one immense grape belt with no isothermal line limiting production

even cities according to tradition claimed to be the birthplace of homer and fully as many nations have asserted themselves as the original home of wine this proves of course that 
 wine holds the same place among material things that immortal homer occupies in poetry china claims the genesis of wine so does egypt and so does greece armenia s claim goes back 
to the time when good old uncle noah departing from the ark which he scuttled on mount ararat planted himself a vineyard and got terribly drunk on new wine ­which served him right 
 because no prudent man would do such a thing however persia deserves especial consideration because of the picturesque story which she has passed down through the ages 
 it concerns the warrior monarch jamshyd he was fond of grapes and grapes in persia grow as marvelously as melons they were brought to jamshyd and all the ladies of his harem 
 in amphorae now the grape capacity of jamshyd and his thirty or forty wives varied sometimes a lot of grapes would accumulate in an amphora the juice would trickle to

how sweet as through the world we pass to find good folk who love their glass 
 brillat savarin ~~~ 
the bottom and ferment everybody was warned that this juice was poisonous for the old persians felt about this fluid the same way that early new englanders felt about tomatoes then called love apples 
now it so happened that plump little sweeta babi of all the ladies of the harem loved jamshyd the best she loved him so much that she suffered from perpetual jealousy now jealousy as all men know makes a 
woman most unattractive and jamshyd neglected her this made her despondent and spoiled her appetite so she could only nibble not eat the grapes the juice sank and fermented she felt so bad that she wanted to 
die and bethought herself of the poison that had accumulated at the bottom of her amphora she took a drinking vessel doubtless the kind from whic h the old persians drank their orange juice lifted the amphora 
in her shapely and beautiful arms and poured herself a bumper of life extinguisher she raised the cup she drained it to the last drop she threw herself on her harem couch and got ready to die she began to 
tingle and the tingle brought happiness life seemed so good but jamshyd s love or nothing nothing at all the throes of death failed to arrive so she filled the cup again and lay down to die again many more 
tingles much more happiness to hell says she i m not going to give jamshyd up to them dames until i have a showdown she drained another cup then walked down the hall to where jamshyd was sleeping she gave him 
a playful pinch on the arm he woke up and looked

sprang out of bed in a split second

 what s the matter with you sweeta babi ? says he what s killing you ? says he

 why did you do that ? says he 
 because you don t love me says she 
is that so ? says he you are the pearl of heaven 
the ruby of the infinite your cheeks reflect the fire of the fire of the fire of oh hang it your cheeks burn me 
 forget it says she i am dying for i drank from the bottom of the amphora 
 sweeta babi says he lead me to it 
now if this old legend be true the old persian hero alcoholically speaking was a quick worker for says omar khayyam 
they say the lion and the lizard keep 
the courts where jamshyd gloried and drank deep 
the hero lost no time in developing a taste for sweeta babi s insidious discovery

but you can t believe most of these old stories when put in the test tube polarization turns left 
you have to put faith in the yarn about noah however because much subsequent history is tinged by it the centuries old patriarch when he tripped down the gangplank of the ark found the water polluted water 
water everywhere but not a drop to drink he refused to quench his thirst with the element in which so many humans and other animals had drowned and decayed he knew something about hygiene did noah so he 
planted himself a vineyard and waited every viticulturist knows it takes from three to four years to get a crop from a new vineyard but noah waited and oh what athirst he built up finally the day arrived he 
drank his fill and full was he he went to sleep at the foot of a tree in a state of nudity his three sons came and took a look at him shem and japheth covered him with their mantles ham stood by and laughed 
when noah woke up he made inquiries and he changed ham into a black man millenia afterwards this act resulted in a great civil war in america followed by a dispute between italy and ethiopia who can foretell 
the trouble yet to come ? the black man feels more poignant pain and pleasure than any other of noah s descendants doubtless because his black skin

one of the famous stories of wine concerns the origin of the noted italian brand est est although it involves the death of a bishop of the church the anecdote is amusing the bishop a german named defoucris 
set out on a pilgrimage to rome he was fond of good wine and to make sure on this point he sent his trusted valet ahead of him by a day s post with instructions that he should taste the wine at every place 
where he stopped and write under the bush the evergreen branch which the tavern keeper puts above his door the word ’est ‘it is if it was tolerable and ‘est est’ ‘it is it is if it was very good but when he 
found it indifferent he should not write up anything defoucris’ valet arrived at monte fiascone and approved so much of the wine that he wrote up est est the bishop found the wine so palatable that he got 
drunk the next day he got drunk again and the day after and the days following he got drunk and drunk and drunk ad infinitum finally he died 0£ acute alcoholism as they say at bellevue hospital new york and 
he never saw the pope at all small matter that for he passed to immortality both above and below they buried him gave the wine the talismanic name est est and erected a monument which to this day bears the 
epitaph which his efficient valet wrote

wine has been the theme 0£ countless poets from anacreon to long fellow first of all in rank is omar khayyam the persian almost 
 unknown to the world until fitzgerald gave him immortality by his exceedingly free translation of the rubaiyat a better text 
 than the original the poets of greece rome italy france germany and england through many ages produced a literature which would 
 fill many volumes the english with perfect anglo saxonism were prone to drink and moralize some unknown bard wrote this 
good wine makes good blood 
good blood causeth good humors good humors cause 
good thoughts good thoughts bring forth good works 
good work carry a man to heaven

thomas jefferson was a champion of wine as a moralist as a patriot and as one deeply interested in the health and vigor of the american people writing from monticello on december 18 1818 to m de neville he said 
 i rejoice as a moralist at the prospect of a reduction of the duties on wine by our national legislature it is an error to view a tax on that liquor as 
 merely a tax on the rich it is a prohibition of its use to the middling class of our citizens and a condemnation of them to the poison of whisky which 
 is desolating their houses no nation is drunken where wine is cheap and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common

the history of wine making in america reads like a romance whose hero is discovery leading from darkness into light the juice of the grape 
the first man to discover the wine making qualities of the native american grape was tyrker the german foster father of lief ericson who accompanied him on his famous voyage of 1 000 a d tyrker whom lief greatly loved got 
 separated from his fellows and was missing for a long time when he returned lief received him most joyously according to an old icelandic manuscript entitled the finding of wineland the good tyrker was in lively spirits 
 he was most supremely happy at first he talked rapidly in german and rolled his eyes then he began to speak the northern tongue he had found vines and grapes such as grew in his native germany whereupon lief called 
 the country wineland and he took on board a cargo of grapes one can feel sure that a part of the cargo was in liquid form and that old tyrker was the first wine maker who ever practiced the art in the united states

actors when the colonists made their settlements and saw the native wild grapes growing so luxuriantly in the woods they conceived the idea of bringing over the european grapes this they 
 did with many varieties always the result was the same the vines grew for three or four years then withered and died the colonist would get a cask or two of wine discouraged he would 
 quit someone else and there were frenchmen and swiss who tried it would plant more european vines and they would wither and die practically the only american wine that was made came 
 from the juice of wild grapes picked in the forests it occurred to no one to domesticate these indigenous grapes give them cultivation and sunshine in open fields so as to improve 
 their quality the palate of the colonist was used to the grapes of europe and he called the native grapes musty and foxy he wouldn t experiment with them the wild grapes grew in profusion 
 so why wouldn t the european varieties ? he couldn t know the reason darwin was as yet unborn and the science of entomology scarcely existed so how could he know that the soft 
 roots of europe s vines were consumed by the tiny devouring worms of the phylloxera and that the leaves shoots and grapes were being sucked to death by minute parasitic plants called 
 fungi ? how could he know that the european grape had never before contended against these pests which were native american and that the american grapes in all their varieties had

 middle of the last century american grape fungi were accidentally carried to europe french experts to their immortal glory dis covered they could be killed with flowers of sulphur or with copper sulphate

 the madeira and the cape they actually proved fitted but they were not what he said they were they were true americans hard rooted and immune to fungus following him came the swiss john james 
 dufour who formed an ambitious vineyard project in kentucky and who acquired plants from legaux including some of the cape grape afterwards known as the alexander alone of all these varieties

finally came john adlum who urged the cultivation of the alexander grape and who disseminated the na tive catawba of which long fellow sang and which was the first superlative 
 american wine grape and who at the stipulation of thomas jefferson published in 1823 cultivation of the vine the first american book on american grapes to quote dr hedrick

 as the battle of yorktown did for political america he listed about seventy varieties of indigenous grapes and freed america from the worship of its european vine fetish

 alone and for convenience the author has divided america into four divisions the east the south california and similar pacific coast terrain and canada the varieties mentioned are not quite those that would have 
 been included in a volume written before prohibition the sumptuary inhibitions of this iniquitous law put viticulturists and scientists on edge more study was given to the making of wine and the production of fine wine

 wide by the pioneer john adlum about 1823 was used by nicholas longworth in the early years of the last century for the production of white wine at cincinnati and is still the 
 basis for the finest of white wines and of champagne in the famous finger lakes region of new york its color is a brilliant red but the skins contain no dissolvable pigment in 
 early stages of fermentation the wine is slightly pinkish but after a year it becomes a glorious golden color favorably grown its juice will contain from 20 to 23 percent of 
 sugar iona this is mentioned second because many hold it to be the most perfect of american wine grapes it originated in 1885 and dr hedrick thinks it contains blood of both the labrusca 
 native american and of vinifera european delicious to the taste it de­velops in fermentation an aroma like that of arabian balm balm in gilead which fills a room with its 
 fragrance emanating from the glass slowly so that he who drinks it is prone not to swallow but to smell as he nurses it along like the catawba it is red in color but produces a 
 golden wine its juice under the most favorable condition with enough units of sunshine will test from 21 to 26 percent of sugar delaware difficult to grow in some locations

adam champ agne this is america s grape of romance alva adam farmer of hammonton new jersey was hunting sixty years ago and found a grape in the south jersey swamps which was so good to eat that he marked 
 the tree upon which it grew and the following spring transplanted the vine to his garden decade after decade he grew it and enjoyed eating it when prohibition came he made cuttings and planted a vineyard 
 the wine losing the musky taste of the ripe grape developed a flavor identical with that of champagne its culture has spread in new jersey delaware maryland and pennsylvania it will not ripen perfectly 
 north of these states its skin is amber and the wine at a year old assumes a beautiful golden color it will probably rank as the most productive white wine grape of the middle atlantic states 
 the above grapes are in a class by themselves also used in the production of white wines in the east and by the east is included the states of the so called middle 
 west embracing missouri and illinois are the following which also do well in the south they produce white not golden wines very much resembling rhenish

missouri reisling produced in missouri in 1870 it ranks with the above varieties as a wine producer 
noah introduced in 1869 at nauvoo illinois this grape is similar to the above it is good for the middle north or the south 
 also in a class by itself stands the following variety 
ontario this is the best white wine grape originated by the new york experiment station to the taste it is nectar being a hybrid of the native labrusca and europe 
 s vinifera its vine is vigorous its american blood frees it from disease the ripe berry is green tinged with gold where the sun kisses it in favorable years 
 it will develop 25 percent of sugar and its wine is a greenish silver like that of chablis but even better than this famed french product maturing early its vintage 
 comes in the last week of august or the first week of september which means that the wine maker s vats can be clear of it before other sorts claim them 
 all the above are white wine varieties but white wine can be made of red grapes crush them press them quickly before fermentation has a

 sorts that are used mainly to enhance the color and body of other wines one third part of cynthjana clevener or diogenes can make a red wine out of a white wine manufactured from any of the varieties mentioned above 
cynthiana or norton it is disputed whether these are two varieties o r one botanical characteristics are the same the wine is indistinguishable but the fact remains that cynthiana ripens two weeks ahead of norton which makes 
 it more desirable in new jersey pennsylvania and new york the wine slightly wild in taste when added to the wine made of sheridan or eumelan produces something that ranks with bur gundy or bordeaux and maybe better 
clevener this began to be raised in the vicinity of egg harbor city new jersey about 1870 like cynthiana and norton it produces a wine so deep in color 
 you can scarcely see through a glass when blended with light red wines the result is a product not much less in quality than when cynthiana is used

 amaury de casanove ~~ grapes ranks with clevener for its color and blending qualities it imparts a slightly wild taste 
ives this makes a very deep red wine but not so deep as the above varieties discovered in 1840 by henry ives near cincinnati it was used by nicholas longworth at cincinnati in the 
 manufacture of port when mingled half and half with the lighter red wines it produces something that is almost indistinguishable from the claret of bordeaux and maybe better 
clinton this grape makes a wine of a slightly deeper color than ives but not of so high quality alone it tastes damnably but when blended not more than 20 percent with light red wines it helps to produce a wine of claret quality 
 the above varieties produce coloring agents but 
there is still another which is now in the process of 
introduction 

westfield this is the newest production of the new york state experiment station and is likely with ontario and sheridan to survive as the greatest achievement of dr hedrick at geneva and of dr gladwin at fredonia there are perhaps 
 only 300 plants in existence of which the author through the courtesy of dr hedrick and dr gladwin has about 100 for experimental purposes the cynthiana norton the clevener the ironclad the ives and the clinton impart a wild

better be merry with the fruitful grape than sadden afternone or bitter fruit 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~~ taste to the blended wine but westfield a hybrid of european and american stocks has deep color without the handicap of offensive taste in a few years it 
 is not disseminated yet it will begin to play its part in the creation of great american red wines its description is inserted here more for the sake of the future than the present 
 the grapes which produce light red wine come next 
sheridan the author is not certain whether this will rank as the first of eastern american wine grapes or whether that place will be shared by ontario silvery white or westfield deep red disseminated by dr hedrick in 1920 as 
 a grape to take the place of concord it has proved to be more productive than concord and to have better growing characteristics concord never will test more than from 13 to 16 percent of sugar sheridan will go to 22 or 
 23 its wine is perfect except for color when one fourth part of cynthiana norton clevener or diogenes is added its color is rectified becoming a beautiful ruby the main point however is its flavor and aroma it emanates the 
 essence of the raspberry as does burgundy and when mingled with the pure wine of the westfield which contains no wildness it is likely to produce a wine that will surpass anything that france can send across the atlantic

 wine making many false notions have been promulgated and the worthlessness of the concord is one of them americans have one taste europeans another let the american taste have its chance 
eumelan aside from sheridan perhaps the best light red wine in america comes from the eumelan grape it isn t liked by vineyardists

 a description of the third classification of wine grapes good for the south follows most of them are the product of hybridization by the late dr t v munson who began his experimental work at denison texas in 1876 only a partial 
 listing is presented here and anyone desiring further infor­mation concerning southern wine grapes of all sorts is referred to munson’s foundations of american grape culture first printed in 1909 and now reprinted in 1935 
beacon this grape produced by munson in 1886 and adapted to both south and north is given first place on the authority of dr f e gladwin of the new york 
 state grape laboratory at fredonia who has conducted experiments in florida the skin is black and the juice is aromatic and spicy it has sufficient 
 tannin in the skins and enough tartaric acid to preserve it from wine diseases and its must possesses from 18 to 20 percent of sugar the author has 
 tasted its wine which is of the claret type full bodied and fragrant the use of this grape will help the south to build up a great wine industry 
wine king originated by munson in 1889 it makes a deep red wine with a slightly wild flavor good for blending lenoir this very old american grape it dates back perhaps to 1810 also known as cigar box and

lomanto perfect in acid content this grape producing a claret type wine is good either for the gulf states or for the north for further description see canada 
fern munson this is the south s catawba flavored grape but its wine is deep red munson originated it in 1893 there is plenty of tannin and tartaric acid 
america this is one of munson s best wine grapes introduced in 1885 it resists the heat of the south and the cold of the north its wine is intensely red the sugar content of the must is 
 very high and if raised to 28 percent after using the saccharometer it can be aged into a very good natural port containing 16 percent of alcohol without ‘fortifying with brandy 
xlnta a munson product of 1893 this grape grown only in the south produces a sprightly deep red wine 
 it will be noted that all the grapes mentioned so far in the third category of the south make red wine suggestions for white wine follow

 white wine it ripens only in the south herbemont this old grape was in cultivation in georgia before the revolution its berries are brown reddish black but the skins have only a trace of pigment 
 it has a high sugar content and sufficient tartaric acid after the first fermentation the new wine appears slightly pink but this within a year becomes amber and after two years a beautiful golden 
 thereby classifying it as a white wine grape given the proper degree of alcohol after using the saccharometer it can produce a southern sauterne herbemont s northern sister is delaware

 california when it comes to wines is america but still not america california with other sections of the southwest is the only portion of the 
 united states where european grapes vitis vinifera can be grown and these varieties prevail there almost exclusively climatically different

 conclusive following is a designation of varieties used in the manufacture of red wines in california and following it a corresponding designation for the making of white wines 
mission this variety is mentioned first because it is the historic grape of california brought there by the earliest fathers of the church probably by junipero sera himself it is pure european but nobody knows what it was called in the 
 old world once says bioletti it was the only grape for white or red wine dry or sweet or for eating grown in california its berries are black carrying pigment red wine is made by fermenting fully on the skins white wine by pressing 
 it as soon as crushed better sorts are taking its place except for the manufacture of sherry it has gained immortality from the fact that it has produced from a plant set at carpinteria california by a spanish woman in 1842 the largest 
 grape vine in the world the trunk of this viticultural giant is eight feet in cir cumference its branches cover half an acre and it produced in 1895 according to the u s agricultural yearbook of 1907 more than ten tons of grapes

concord ripening perfectly but of low sugar content unless a pound or a pound and a half of cane sugar be added to the must the wine is so deficient in alcohol 7 or 8 percent that the product is susceptible afterward despite all ordinary 
 precautions to vinegar fermentation if raised in sugar content a fair red wine can be made by blending with other grapes however the addition of cane sugar may impart a slightly bitter taste to the product see chapter on wine making 
niagara this grape will ripen but it has no more sugar than concord and its wine has a flavor that reminds one of the taste of listerine

implements 
carpenter can not work without tools n either can a man make wine satisfactorily without utensils these may vary from the simplest sort of outfit to the amazing power presses and combined crushers – stemmers ­pressers of 
the big wineries this book does not concern the latter it is primarily for the small wine maker and if he in the course of years graduates into a big wine maker he must perforce call in the services of an expert such as the 
 winery implement houses stand ready to provide for him below is a list of the appliances which the home wine maker and the small winery require some of them are indispensable for the former and all of them for the latter 
cellar this very strictly is not an implement but a location but it comes first and no man should try to produce wine without a 
 cellar to provide a low and even temperature this subject will be treated at length in the chapter headed cellar and bottle 
fermenting vats these may take the form of large pottery jars or of kegs and barrels with the heads removed the more ambitious will perhaps want

regular fermenting vats made of oak or redwood whose tops are considerably smaller than their bottoms and which can be obtained from barrel 
 factories in all three cases heavy muslin cloths should be provided which can be closely fastened with sections of clothes line so as 
 to hold in the vat a part of the carbon dioxide arising from fermentation all vats should be placed on heavy wooden frames or platforms 
 18 inches high so as to facilitate the siphoning or drawing off of the wine when the first fermentation is complete as indicated by 
the sinking of the skins siphon wells these can be constructed of large mesh wire one fourth inch heavily galvanized they are made round five or six inches in diameter and the joining can be 
 done with fine copper wire they should be just high enough to reach beyond the top of the vat they should be covered with a single layer of cheesecloth sewed to the frame and to the bottom 
siphons these are made of rubber tubing of one half inch inside measurement and of a length sufficient to reach from the bottom of the well over the top of the vat and to a vessel on the 
 floor they should be tied in two or three places to a piece of heavy straight wire galvanized or copper the latter preferred long enough to reach from the bottom of the well to six 
 56 who drinks more shall drink less zipoli ~~ inches above the top of the vat the tube must not go to the end of the wire and in operation the tube can be 
 made to slide upward so as to avoid clogging with the murk that is likely to gather at the bottom of the well and which must be thrown out every so often 
crusher this consists of a wooden hopper at the bottom of which are two rollers of non corroding metal or rubber which on operation of 
 the crank revolve in opposite directions these rollers can be adjusted so that the grapes passing between them will be thoroughly 
 crushed without any seed being broken there are arms at the bottom of the crusher which enable it to be securely placed across 
 the top of the vat a crusher can be bought at almost every hardware store at a modest price don t get a little toy one 
press this standard implement upright and operated by hand may be bought cheaply enough at hardware stores or winery supply houses it were best not to purchase a tiny affair but a good and heavy one 
 the more ambitious may obtain for more money pressers operated by electrical power or centrifugal pressers which look like torpedoes the smaller of which may be operated by hand the larger by power 
vessels you will require buckets preferably enameled or of copper although galvanized ware will do of three gallons capacity and if possible narrower 
 at the top that the bottom in which the siphoned or pressed wine can be carried to the storage barrels three might do but four would be better

measuring vessels for the sake of accuracy in measuring you should have at least one u s standard gallon measure preferably of copper if you have u s bonded winery possession of measuring vessels is obligatory 
funnels large sized funnels are required for pouring the wine from buckets into barrels preferably of copper but galvanized ware will do don t get small ones or you will regret it 
gauging sticks and wantage rods these are not necessary unless you are operating under government license combined they enable you or the government inspector to determine the exact amount of wine in a full or a partly full barrel 

saccharometer this is absolutely necessary for without it you cannot ascertain the percentage of sugar in your wine must it will cost you at an instrument shop or a winery supply house from 2.50 to 4.00 
acidimeter this is not absolutely necessary unless you are operating a u s bonded winery it is useful however because it enables 
 you to ascertain the exact amount of acid in your grape must or wine a little practice will make you proficient in its use

 rubber tube of the same size closing all jointures with paraffine and placing the end of the tube in a vessel of water at a lower level

wine making 
heoretically the making of wine is as easy as rolling off a log to borrow a pioneer expression wine is the fermented juice of grapes crush your grapes let them ferment and you have wine but try it at every stage in the making of wine an 
enemy lurks beside the real wine yeasts saccharomyces ellipsoideus of many benevolent varieties which actually create wine by transforming the sugar in your must into about 52 percent potable alcohol 2 percent glycerine 
 which is a higher alcohol and 44 percent carbonic dioxide gas which goes up in the air the other 2 percent nourishing the yeast there are malignant yeasts and bacilli which tend to undo your work and ruin your product 
 somebody wrote many decades ago that sugar divided itself in fermentation into 50 percent alcohol and 50 percent carbonic gas this fallacy like many other fallacies in grape culture 
 and wine making has been repeated by subsequent writers there are scores of such mistakes they will persist as long as writers write from other writers books instead of experience 
 61 
wine that maketh glad the heart of man psalms ~~ the bad yeasts are called by the scientists saccharomyces apiculatus mycoderma vini of many strains torula yeasts saccharomyces anomalus saccharomyces 
 ludwigii saccharomyces cerevisaie beer yeast saccharomyces pasteurianus now don t be scared when fermentation starts it is estimated that there are 1 000 000 cells of malevolent yeast to every single 
 cell of real wine yeast however cheer up the one good cell kills off the 1 000 000 in a short while when proper management is practiced the true wine yeast cells multiply marvelously fast and in two 
 or three days when fermentation is active there are 6 000 000 000 of their cells in a fluid ounce of the juice the problem is to produce such conditions that the true yeast will quickly raise 
 the alcoholic content to 10 percent then the battle is won if proper subsequent management is employed then there are moulds that destroy wine like the pencillium glaucum or green mould which develops 
 on broken grapes in unclean barrels and utensils next in contradistinction to yeasts and moulds which are vegetable organisms come bacilli which be long to the animal kingdom most to be feared 
 is the vinegar bacteria but it can be controlled easily because it cannot exist without the presence of air and is quickly killed by sulphur no acetic acid vinegar can form in a cask which is kept 
 bung full of wine and has been subjected before use to the burning of sulphur but if these precautions are not followed this bacteria can attack the alcohol in your wine it is a toper and wants 
 62 
never did a great man hate good wine rabelais ~~ nothing else and transform it into vinegar in this connection it may be noted that if the sugar content of must is 
 raised to 26 percent thereby producing a wine with 14 percent alcohol neither the vinegar bacteria nor any other disease can do much to harm your wine even under 
 medium adverse conditions other bacteria deleterious to wine are the tourne organism which produces a mousy odor and taste it is dangerous be cause unlike the vinegar 
 bacteria it grows in the absence of air which gives little trouble in dry wines containing no sugar mannite bacteria and the bacteria which produces slimy wines 
now sit up and listen wine maker the foregoing paragraphs sound discouraging but they need not alarm you heed this cleanliness is your salvation keep your cellar and your fermenting room scrupulously clean use whitewash 
 and disinfectants sulphur your barrels and your fermenting vats immerse your bungs in boiling water every cloth every utensil scald with boiling water every time before you use it pour boiling water through your 
 siphons every two weeks fill vessels with sulphur and disinfect your cellar be clean be prophylactic and you never will lose an ounce of wine this advice is based on experience the author out of hatred of the sumptuary 
 laws of his country be gan making wine fifteen years ago he planted an experimental vineyard and he consulted experts and he never has lost either from wild yeasts moulds or bacteria a cubic centimeter of wine 
some writers hold that wine should not be ameliorated 
 63 
it warms the blood adds luster to the eyes andwine nil love have ever been allies qvid 
 ~~ by the addition of cane sugar which in 48 hours mixed with the grape becomes grape sugar but if no sugar is used in the case of grapes which normally 
 are deficient in that element or which in bad seasons are deficient so that only 13 to 15 percent of sugar is present the wine maker will have a highly 
 acid wine of 7 to 8 percent alcohol nobody on earth can keep such a wine from spoiling except by pasteurization whic h impairs the quality when a variety 
 of wine grape yields a sugar content of 22 to 24 percent it is best to leave it alone when it is lower in sugar its content must be raised to 25 
 or 26 percent which will yield a wine of 14 percent alcohol by volume this is done as follows estimate the amount of juice you have exclusive of skins 
 and seeds grapes differ greatly in pro­portions measure your sugar content by means of the saccharometer then heighten it to 25 or 26 percent by the 
 addition of cane sugar on the basis that one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will raise the content 9 percent thus if you have must that has 17 per 
 cent of sugar the addition of one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will give you a must of 26 percent sugar producing a wine of 14 percent alcohol 
some writers advise the amelioration of super acid wine must with water the addition of water tends to destroy the quality of any wine and the method never should 
 be employed except when a bad season has caused the must when tested by the acidimeter to show more than 1 percent of acid in such a case one gallon of

let those who drink not but austerely dine 
dry up in law the muses smell of wine horace 

 ~ water may be added to five gallons of juice carefully calculated and this gallon of water must be sweetened with 2 1/2 pounds of 
 sugar the normal must should previously have been raised to 25 percent of sugar all of this is permitted by the government in its 
regulations 
the normal eastern wine grape varies from 4 percent to 8 percent in acid content instead of adding sugared water a process which is called gallizing after 
 dr gall a german scientist it would be better to blend at the completion of fermentation wines having too much acid with those having too little an 
 alternative would be the keeping of the wines in casks for a number of years as the french do during which time the superfluous tartaric acid would be 
 cast down to the botto m in the shape of crystals making the aged wine mellow and perfect can americans have the patience for this ? they ought to have 
keep water out of your wine for water can better be used in bathtubs 0r to sprinkle lawns 
having praised wine told its history described grapes that act as the tcraw material listed the needed imple ments and presented certain sanitary and ameliorating principles the next thing is to proceed to actual methods 
wandering along according to his own whim the author is going to divide processes into three categories first the traditional method 
 which originated in ancient times and reached its perfection before pasteur came on the scene second the advanced method 
 65 
they eat and drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy milton ~ which takes in on a simplified scale some of pasteur s discoveries and third the modern method of the latter very little 
 will be said because it belongs to the big wineries and the experts at this point however the author wants to give the reader a vision of the future pasteur believed that alcohol was produced 
 in vinous fermentation by the action of the living yeast cells on the sugar in the must if i am asked he said in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed and what is its real 
 cause i reply that i am completely ignorant of it the scientist buchner disposed of pasteur s puzzlement just a few years ago he showed that fermentation was not the result of the growth of 
 the living yeast cell but that it resulted from a secretion an infinitely small exudation of the yeast cell he called the secretion zymase now who knows that the scientists of the future will not be 
 able to extract this zymase from the yeast and afterwards to create it synthetically so that the wine maker of the future will be able to pasteurize or defecate his juice by means of meta bisulphite 
 and by adding the proper zymase ferment the most perfect wines the world has ever known a vision but who in the days of abraham lincoln could have dreamed of tele vision ? always there are enough 
 of the true yeast cells on the skins of grapes to start fermentation they hibernate in the ground and are blown onto the grapes by the wind when they begin their work in the wine must 
 66 
scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendant vintage as it grows gray 
 ~ subsisting on sugar they immediately begin multiplication by means of buds which dropping off become new cells the rate of propagation is astonishing 
 and as has been said in two or three days after normal fermentation begins as many as 6 000 000 000 of them exist in an ounce of must 
the management in fermentation differs in the making of red wine and white wine but since the manufacture of the former employs most of the principles used with the latter it will be considered first 
red wine 
traditional method be sure first as a preliminary that your fermenting cellar is absolutely clean its walls should be whitewashed adding a cup of dissolved salt or alum to every two gallons of the mixture purify the floor by 
 disinfecting with chlorine or some reliable odor less commercial preparation let there be no vegetables fruits green wood or rubbish in your cellar last of all bum a few plates of sulphur in it after closing all apertures 
let every vat be scalded outside and inside with boiling water the big wineries use steam turn the vats upside down and burn just a little 
 sulphur under each scald every portion of your crusher and your press with boiling water and do the same with every other utensil 
you are now ready to proceed with the vintage 
 67 
but still the vine her ancient ruby yields and still a garden by the water blows 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~ 
grapes for red wine should be allowed to reach full ripeness but 
not become over ripe they should be harvested in bright weather 
and not before all the dew on them has evaporated the berries must 
be separated from the stems from all green grapes and from grapes 
that are rotten in any degree whatsoever or have their skins broken 
for such grapes harbor the deleterious wild yeasts and bacteria the 
manner of separation may be in two ways for the small wine 
producer 1 by hand 2 by picking each bad grape out of each 
bunch then pulling the bunch across a board from one to two inches 
thick through which long nails have been driven in rows so that the 
sharp ends stand up an inch and a half the board being carved with 
run ways through which juice may flow into the pan bucket or jar 
which you are using these operations can be performed in the open 
air on a porch or under a shed by women and children the big 
wineries of course have stemming machines but they cannot 
escape if they are conscientious the laborious task of removing the 
bad grapes 
now carry the grapes to the fermenting cellar and put them through the crusher into the vat fill the vat only three fourths full for if you fill higher the expanding mass will spillover the top tie tightly with a

fermenting room should be between 60 and 75 degrees fermentation raises the heat of the must and if it goes over 90 degrees 
 the wine yeast begins to die and at 100 degrees fahrenheit it is killed absolutely the vat fermentation of red wines 
 will last from 5 to 10 days the former at a cellar temperature of 75 degrees the latter at 60 degrees you will know when it is complete because the ticking sound will almost cease and the murk on top will begin to sink into the wine 
the first fermentation done the next two steps are siphoning off and pressing put the «wells to the very bottom of the vats insert the rubber siphons have your buckets ready suck on 
 the lower end of the tube until you get wine in your mouth then let the juice flow into the bucket spit the juice out for it wouldn t be good for you if you swallowed it remember 
 what new wine did to noah carry the new wine into your wine cellar and pour it through a funnel into the barrel where the secondary or slow fermentation is to take place fill within 
 three or four inches of the top then adjust your water seal before long the tup tup tup of the gas escaping through the water will make most delightful music for your ears 
at first the vat wine will flow furiously through the siphoning tube but suddenly will come a gurp and the flow will cease wait a few minutes for the well to 
 fill again this may be expedited by lifting out the well and scraping the slimy murk off the cheesecloth covering siphon once more until there is another

truth itself doth flow in wine samuel johnson ~ gurp and keep the process going until no more juice gathers in the well try different sides of the vat 
then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation 
 occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale 
this siphoned wine will be your best wine 
 next comes pressing which yields another quality the murk seeds and skins is removed into the drum of the press and the rest of the juice is extracted put a piece of 
 strong but not too closely woven cloth previously boiled in the drum monks cloth from any department store is preferable then pour in enough of the murk to bring the 
 height to four or six inches fold the cloth over the top of the murk put in another section of cloth and fill it in the same manner then other sections until the drum 
 is nearly full apply pressure until no more juice runs then remove all the sections except the bottom one and place them temporarily in a pan uncovering the bottom 
 layer of murk at its top stir it until it is loose put the other layers in and do the same thing then resume pressing repeat the loosening of the murk and the pressing 
 until the residue is quite dry then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons 
 of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary

 percent more alcohol than the siphoned wine it is harsher of taste containing more tannin and tartaric acid some mix it immediately with the siphoned wine but it were best to let it mature in 
 separate casks and use it for blending afterward never does disease occur in pressed wine when correctly managed because of its high alcoholic content and its excess of tannin and tartaric 
advanced method this is where pasteur and his discoveries come in about three days before the red grapes are to be fermented take some of the ripest a gallon or 
 more according to the size of the main fermentation put them in a small vat in a room of 70 degrees to 75 degrees temperature the temperature is imperative 
 and in three days they will contain a maximum of wine yeast cells perhaps 6000000000 to the ounce of juice when the main manufacture begins stir thoroughly 
 into your vats a gallon of this must to every 30 gallons of new must the prepared yeast will work so quickly that no wild yeast will have a chance 
modern method science has full play in this and it is used mainly by the big wineries it consists of the employment of wine yeast cultures 
 to start the fermentation big wineries having laboratories segregate pure yeast that has produced superior wine commercial 
 laboratories supply many forms of pure yeast even the kinds that make the best wines in europe state experiment stations are 
 working on it and at geneva new york 90 kinds of pure yeasts are in experimentation governments in this can aid wine makers 
come a fresh bumper for why should we go 
while the nectar still reddens our cups as they flow ? 
 oliver wendell holmes 
 
grape must requires special treatment before it is impregnated with these cultured yeasts every native yeast benevolent or malevolent and all bacteria must first be killed this can be done by pasteurization the raising of the 
 temperature to 140 degrees but this is prone to destroy certain desirable qualities the favorite method is sterilization by means of potassium metabisulfite when the cultured yeast finally is added there is no competition 
the modern method is not within the scope of this book and the 
above is written mainly to stir the imagination of the reader the 
graduate of small wine manufacture into big wine making will on 
request be referred to authorities who can tell him all he wants to 
know about these ultra modern methods 
white wine 
it is a fetish long abiding that white wine has to be made from fresh juice pressed from grapes as soon as they are crushed but let the small wine maker without a power press 
 try it if he use all his muscle on the press he can hardly extract a worth while amount of juice from grapes that have not been softened by the first stages of fermentation 
however if white wine is to be made from grapes having dissolvable red pigment in them it is obligatory that as much of the white juice 
 as possible be extracted as soon as they are crushed what is left over can be put through the regular red wine fermentation 
 72 
drink and smile and learn to think that we were born to smile and drink 
 anacreon moore 
 ~ 
certain grapes of a pink or amber hue have no dissolvable color in the skins such as catawba iona delaware and adam champagne and despite externals cannot be classed 
 with red wine grapes they can be considered in the same category as the grapes which when ripe are green or golden green such as the ontario the elvira etc 
white wine can be made from these grapes when they are put to full fermentation on the skin and in this case the procedure is exactly that in the case of red 
 wine such wine is full bodied astringent because of its tannin and wholesomely acid because of its tartaric it cannot spoil except under bad management 
the full process of white wine making is precisely that of the red process differing not in the slightest degree there are two other traditional processes suitable for the small wine maker 
first traditional method let the grapes after being crushed ferment in vats for a day or two until the pulp is soft then 1 siphon and 2 press the residue may be allowed 
 to continue its fermentation in vats and there will result a very alcoholic heavy and highly flavored wine which managed precisely as red wine may delight the heart 
second traditional method by muscle and dexterity extract in the press as much of the juice as you can as soon as the grapes are pressed 
 ferment the residue and there will be lots of it precisely as you would for red wine the product of this residue will be 
 73 
we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart shakespeare 
 ~ 
several points better than the product mentioned in the paragraph 
above 
after treatment of both traditional methods the juice 
mentioned in both the preceding paragraphs should not be fermented 
in vats it should be transferred to barrels filled three fourths with 
water seals immediately inserted both the first furious fermentation 
and the later secondary slow fermentation can take place in the same 
barrels when the first fermentation is through the barrels should be 
filled to within three or four inches of the top from the contents of 
other barrels or demijohns and the second fermentation should 
proceed still under the water seals it is difficult to tell when the 
primary fermentation ends and the secondary begins so it is best to 
fill the barrels when the bubbling of the water seals becomes slow 
advanced method this is exactly the same as for red wine except that under the first traditional method for white wine the whole starter skins and pulp should be added to the grapes as soon as 
 crushed whereas in the second traditional method only the juice from the starter should be added to the freshly pressed juice of the grape see red wine paragraph entitled advanced method . 
modern method this is applicable only to freshly pressed juice defecated by means of potassium metabisulfite and filtered pure yeast culture is then added only big wineries can do it 
this ends the instructions on primary processes but you are not done yet wine maker wait until you step into your wine cellar

vi cellar and bottle 

~ your cellar wine maker is 
like the cell of an old 
arabian alchemist 
in it you succeed or fail in 
transmuting your raw material 
into as perfect a product as 
possible 
if you have followed the directions of the last chapter you have a fine chance of success but if you ignore good wine practice in your cellar you will fail 
now this cellar should be separate from your fermenting room and always dark it should be whitewashed and made sanitary exactly as your fermenting room was keep everything out of it except your wine 
 and your appliances no vegetable no fruit no rubbish if you have a cellar under your residence you can partition it off part for your fermenting room part for the true wine cellar if you have 
 a steep hillside and some money you can drive straight in with a stemming room outside under a shed a fermenting room a little further in partly covered with earth and a real cellar still further . 
 this arrangement will constitute a small winery ready for licensing by the united states government but before you go that far learn by your own experience how to make good and salable wine

 the rubaiyat fourth edition ~ mount your barrels heads fronting the passageway on strong frames not platforms 18 inches high scald each barrel inside and outside with boiling water and sulphur 
 each of them inside by means of your sulphur cistern previously described first your barrels will be filled with new wine red or white under water seals when these water seals cease 
 to bubble you may know that your wine has passed altogether through the first and secondary fermentations remove the water seals rack your wine by means of siphons into clean and sulphured . 
 barrels and fill them until the wine overflows the bunghole drive in the bung as often as is necessary pour in more wine so as to make it overflow the bunghole this operation is called 
 by the french ullage it is vital because it excludes disease in the spring when the grapes flower there will be a slight tertiary or third fermentation and when the new grapes ripen in september 
 or october there will be slight fourth fermentation then the wine may be considered as made the bungs then may be sealed with wax or paraffine ullage thereafter can be performed . 
 every six months the wine s quality can be watched and when the proper time comes you can put it in bottles the process of fining is seldom needed in the states east of the rocky mountains 
 usually three or four rackings of the wine is enough to give it brilliance however a deficiency of tannin may cause the wine to stay murky in this case the small wine maker can

dissolved overnight in a small quantity of wine stir these materials into the cask and in a few days the solid materials will be carried down to the lees bigger wineries will use filtration or centrifuging 
machines with less injury to the bouquet and flavor of the wine racking consists of siphoning the wine off the lees into another cask two or three rackings are usually sufficient these should be made in bright weather 
don t buy cheap bottles and don t buy cheap corks when it comes to bottling choose a bright sunshiny day put your corks in water brought to a boil to soften them but do not boil . 
 them if you have strong fingers you can insert the corks until their tops reach just below the tops of the bottles however a corking machine is desirable and quite cheap 
when your wine thoroughly matured in the oak is bottled then comes bottle management they are laid on their sides in tiers so that the corks are always in contact with 
 the wine in the barrels your wine will have been ameliorated because crystals of tartaric acid will have been thrown down to the bottom in bottles there will . 
 be no more of this but something infinitely more important will occur the acids working on the alcohol will produce in the bottles what scientific men call esters 
 or ethers the most important one being the oenanthic ester wine aroma in five or six years american wine in the bottle should reach its acme of excellence

 the rubaiyat fourth edition some addenda the preceding part of this chapter and the whole of the one before it have been devoted to dry red wine 
 and dry white wine for the sake of a complete record the author proceeds to other classifications perhaps out of the range of his readers 
concord possibilities the author has promised to give directions for the making of a drinkable wine from concord grapes all right if the author 
 were named hercules he would consider this his thir teenth labor but all right you can t as the venerable aphorism says make a silk 
 purse out of a sow s ear but who knows in these scientific days if something like rayon may not be made from the aural appendage of a female 
 hog first concord method gather the despised concord when it is fully ripe not over ripe test it by the saccharometer which will 
 not register more than 13 to 16 percent of sugar and raise its sugar content to 20 percent which will deliver to you approximately a wine 
 of 11 percent alcohol when the second fermentation is complete drink it without delay be cause if you don t you ll have nothing but 
 vinegar or worse second concord method as soon as you crush the grapes press out what white juice you can raise the sugar content of this 
 to 22 percent treat exactly as white wine the residue you can ferment as in the first concord method third concord method raise the

 the rubaiyat fourth edition ~ sugar content to 25 percent which will give you 14 percent alcohol crush the stems until they are pulpy after removing all bad grapes and add this to 
 the crushed grapes ferment as previously described for red wine blend with cynthiana norton clevener diogenes r any other intensely red wine fourth concord method raise the sugar 
 content to 29 or 30 percent macerate the stems as described above ferment in the vats until the murk sinks when it is in the casks add some caramel sugar burnt until it is brown 
 black some cinnamon some licorice or aniset just a little glycerine some oil of lemon a little calamus some tartaric acid if the wine is too flat establish all the proportions 
 by experiment and if you can add enough brandy or alcohol to give the wine 22 percent alcoholic content and this if you properly age it will be as good port as you can get from 
 europe at 2 00 the quart and without an injurious element in it sherry iona catawba delaware and adam champagne wine in the east can be transformed into sherry raise the must to 
 28 percent of sugar which will deliver a wine of 16 percent alcohol in the follow ing summer after its production in the fall expose it to high temperatures either in direct sunshine 
 protected with heavy blankets at night or in attics that grow super heated by the sunshine on the roof if this high temperature be kept up for four months all of the wine

come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used 
 shakespeare will become rich like sherry and some of the casks will produce rancio the all important ingredient of sherry from jerez in spain jerez 
 became in english sherries in california the wine from mission and palomino grapes treated to this hot amelioration produces the same results 
 however sherry to be like spanish sherry should have brandy added to it at various stages of heating until at the end its alcoholic content will 
 be about 21 percent also some burnt sugar of course sherry can be perfected by the use of sherry flavor now on the market but don t do it 
port this is a generic name for a dark or tawny red wine highly alcoholized by the addition of brandy it became the first wine of england because of the treaty that lord methuen made with 
 portugal to spite france but when is port actually port ? to use a gilbertian term its purity has been «what never ? well hardly ever americans using a dark red wine whose fermentative 
 juice has been raised to 29 percent can produce a wine registering 16% percent of alcohol by means of brandy or pure grain alcohol this can be raised to 22 degrees or 24 degrees 
 by the addition of cinnamon licorice aniset capsicum cassia quassia calamus lemon oil burnt sugar and other things a really perfect imitation of port can be produced 
angelica this considerable product of california is not a fermented wine at all certain delicious juices from california grapes are extracted defecated by the addition of potassium meta­bisulifite properly

in all ages of the world in sacred and profane history the abuse not the use of wine has been condemned cyrus redding 1851 filtered and fortified with 
 brandy about 18 or 19 percent until fermentation is impossible then sent to the eastern markets it is not wine but it is a nice sweet drink for ladies 
champagne the making of this wine involves a highly complicated and expensive process that cannot interest the readers of this book it is true that a 
 pseudo champagne can be produced from any good white wine by means of gas from a carbonic torpedo like soda water or by putting into the bottle a 
 little dry ice such champagne is worthless it will sparkle for three or four minutes ­whereas real champagne will effervesce for half an hour anyone 
 actually interested in the production of real champagne is invited to communicate with the author in care of the orange judd publishing company 
now having made good wine how are you going to drink it ? the next chapter will take up that extremely important subject

the repeal of prohibition was the signal for the appearance of a number of very fine and sophisticated books on the consumption 
 and connoisseurship of wine they were delightful in the reading they said one particular wine should be drunk with one
~ 
particular kind of food that another wine went with another course 
and that still another sort of wine went with another sort of food 
that red meat and chicken and some sort of cheese required red 
wine as did spa ghetti that sherry accompanied soup that fish 
required white wine that champagne was appropriate to any sort of 
food that sweets needed a cordial wine like sauterne etc etc 
etc 

these picturesque and entertaining books repeated the dicta of chefs and maitres d hotel for a hundred and more years somebody first put it in print and then it was repeated over and over again by subsequent writers 
 the directions white wine for this red wine for that sherry for this port for that champagne for everything cordials for sweets have been repeated so many times that they have become a sort of parrots jamboree

the writers of these books were talking to rich customers who 
in the world serves all these european wines at dinner parties either 
at their homes or at restaurants except city slickers and men of 
great wealth or city salesmen who are trying to please out of town 
buyers ? the instruction in these books does not belong to the little 
wine maker for whom this book was written if the little fellow the 
only one the author cares about wants to pull off a state party 
having for his guests the marchioness quiff quaff the duke of 
down down herr hitler signor mussolini the prince of wales 
stalin and the emperor of japan it were best that he call in a caterer 
who will provide the proper glasses the proper wines and the proper 
food he can get all this for 2 000 or 3 000 perhaps glasses ? the idea that their shape has anything to do with the enjoyment of wine is simply bunk and no american citizen with . 
 any ability to think should give the matter his attention such things belong only to the imaginations of the aesthetes what does amount to something however is the color 
 0 f the glass wine should never be poured into a glass of any other color than pure crystal which means no color at all talleyrand in his historic dictum has told us to look . 
 at the wine first and enjoy its color to lift it to the nostril and enjoy the bouquet then to convey it to the mouth and enjoy the taste through the crystal glass you can

the first dukes of burgundy established vineyards on their own ac­count and we learn from their ancient ordinances how much theyprided themselves on the possession 
 of the finest wine countries in chris­tendom and the duke of burgundy was often designated by the title of prince of good wines william robert prince 1830 . 
 enjoy the color whether it be red as the ruby have the sparkle of the garnet present the precious yellow of gold the pure white of rhenish or the greenish silver of the wine made from the ontario grape . 
the aesthetes are right on one point a heavy wine with much aroma should be served in a large glass filled half way twirl such a glass and you will get all the bouquet 
to debunk the wine glass is one thing to debunk the idea of the connoisseur writer that wine in america should be served with meals and not otherwise is another yet it ought not to be difficult 
the great mass of americans have always drunk wine as a between meals beverage an intoxicant if you like they care not at all for it as a fluid to wash down foods as do the 
 french and the italians for an hour or two before dinner the american will want to drink wine but when wine is set before him at dinner he will take very little of it the 
 author of this book has tried it out at his home on college professors newspaper editors publishers scientists authors of best sellers and many others they wanted their wine . 
 before not dur ing the meal white wine with fish ? the glasses were untouched red wine with chicken or beef ? the chicken or beef was eaten but the wine was not drunk 
this advice to the american who makes his own wine and consumes it let your taste be your guide if you

if grapes were in colonial new england or wine was made from theforeign grape no great degree of success was attained wine was mad~in plenty from the wild 
 grapes in all of the new england colonies so thatit was not because of puritanical prejudices against wine that thei vine was not grown dr u p hedrick 
 can t enjoy wine and if you can t enjoy wine surely you can t drink beer with your meals call it off eat your fill and take your customary coffee but if you have 
 been drinking wine before the meal take no milk when wine or milk are mixed all the laws of chemistry smack at you before the meal drink all you ought to have of 
 wine put your best wine before your guests and give them all they ought to have but no more be a considerate host in spite of the french arid the italians never 
 mind the meal when people are hungry they are not thirsty transmogrify yourself all you like if you are american and anglo saxon you cannot escape racial facts 
neither the national government nor the state governments have ever taken the question of aiding the wine maker very much to heart the entrenched whisky and gin interests by means 
 of independent propaganda have since repeal easily swung the nation into a hard liquor country the manufacturers of beer have had their say yet the united states has no nook or 
 portion which will not produce wine and the united states is almost as big as all europe combined 3 738 393 square miles as compared with europe s 3 776 700 the isothermal line that 
 cuts the great northern portion of europe off from wine production does not touch the united states though it excludes half of europe in the whole of its vast terrain there 
 85 
in france alone the vine culture gives employment to two millions oflaborers without enumerating many subordinate mechanical branchesthat are benefited by it 
 and it is attended with immense nationaladvantages these circumstances call upon our national government to pursue the course long since adopted by france 
 william robert prince american botanist 1830 is no wine isothermal it can be the world s greatest wine zone 
anglo saxons are a race subject to extremes they have their cycles of reform and perdition in one decade they are knocking at the doors of hell 
 in the next they are beseeching st peter for forgiveness at the gates of heaven they won t stay put but they drink even when they stand 
 before the pearly gates they either have or wish they had hip flasks it would be a great thing if they could be taught that the proper consumption 
 of pure dry wines would cause them to confront st peter with better livers and better kidneys and may hap better consciences 
if america in the course of years can be made a wine drinking country it would greatly advantage the people and moreover it would forever make impossible the return of the ogre prohibition 
 now comes the most important paragraph in this book take it to heart wine maker take it to heart having made your wine consume it with food or without as suits your whim if you want to drink it at dinner 
 let your taste be your guide in spite of savarin or anybody else but this author knows you will drink it nine cases out of ten just by itself and between meals now then don t drink too much of it

this wine makers manual is dedicated to the 
government of the united states to all the state governments to the government of the dominion of canada and to the oenological experts of the province of ontario 
the american federal government at no time has done much of anything to help the wine maker either in the way of giving him technical guidance or in finding 
 him foreign markets with two notable exceptions the state governments have done nothing california has taken the lead with marvelous scientific 
 work new york has been of great aid by producing better varieties of wine grapes and has now begun scientific research in wine making included in . 
 which are experiments with more than ninety pure wine yeast cultures ontario has begun experimentation to provide better varieties of wine grapes 
with the exception of these two american states and one canadian province practically nothing has been done by constituted authority to help the wine maker the enormously big wineries . 
 do not need help except in the finding of foreign markets they have their own laboratories and experts the little ones do need guidance many a writer has said that the small wineries 
 5 
in europe and california produce a superior product governments should help them to reach perfection 
the neglect of the united states to help the wine maker is in sorry contrast with european practice the governments of france germany and italy especially provide scientific research instruction and 
 foreign prop­aganda america can produce as good wine as any other nation on earth and vastly more of it the united states is one immense grape belt with no isothermal line limiting production 
 acknowledgment is hereby made of help extended to the author by dr u p hedrick director of the new york state agricultural experiment .

even cities according to tradition claimed to be the birthplace of homer and fully as many nations have asserted themselves as the original home of wine this proves of course that 
 wine holds the same place among material things that immortal homer occupies in poetry china claims the genesis of wine so does egypt and so does greece armenia s claim goes back 
to the time when good old uncle noah departing from the ark which he scuttled on mount ararat planted himself a vineyard and got terribly drunk on new wine ­which served him right 
 because no prudent man would do such a thing however persia deserves especial consideration because of the picturesque story which she has passed down through the ages 
 it concerns the warrior monarch jamshyd he was fond of grapes and grapes in persia grow as marvelously as melons they were brought to jamshyd and all the ladies of his harem 
 in amphorae now the grape capacity of jamshyd and his thirty or forty wives varied sometimes a lot of grapes would accumulate in an amphora the juice would trickle to 
 11 
how sweet as through the world we pass to find good folk who love their glass 
 brillat savarin ~~~ 
the bottom and ferment everybody was warned that this juice was poisonous for the old persians felt about this fluid the same way that early new englanders felt about tomatoes then called love apples 
now it so happened that plump little sweeta babi of all the ladies of the harem loved jamshyd the best she loved him so much that she suffered from perpetual jealousy 
 now jealousy as all men know makes a woman most unattractive and jamshyd neglected her this made her despondent and spoiled her appetite so she could only nibble 
 not eat the grapes the juice sank and fermented she felt so bad that she wanted to die and bethought herself of the poison that had accumulated at the bottom of 
 her amphora she took a drinking vessel doubtless the kind from whic h the old persians drank their orange juice lifted the amphora in her shapely and beautiful 
 arms and poured herself a bumper of life extinguisher she raised the cup she drained it to the last drop she threw herself on her harem couch and got ready to die 
 she began to tingle and the tingle brought happiness life seemed so good but jamshyd s love or nothing nothing at all the throes of death failed to arrive so 
 she filled the cup again and lay down to die again many more tingles much more happiness to hell says she i m not going to give jamshyd up to them dames until i 
 have a showdown she drained another cup then walked down the hall to where jamshyd was sleeping she gave him a playful pinch on the arm he woke up and looked 
 12 
wine is like rain when it falls on the mire it makes it all the fouler but where it strikes the good soil wakes it to beauty and bloom 
 john hay 
 ~~~ at her and saw a most amazing vision of beauty and vivacity he 
sprang out of bed in a split second 
 i’m dying says she 
 what s the matter with you sweeta babi ? says he what s killing you ? says he 
 i drank the juice from the bottom of the amphora says she 
 why did you do that ? says he 
 because you don t love me says she 
is that so ? says he you are the pearl of heaven 
the ruby of the infinite your cheeks reflect the fire of the fire of the fire of oh hang it your cheeks burn me 
 forget it says she i am dying for i drank from the bottom of the amphora 
 sweeta babi says he lead me to it 
now if this old legend be true the old persian hero alcoholically speaking was a quick worker for says omar khayyam 
they say the lion and the lizard keep 
the courts where jamshyd gloried and drank deep 
the hero lost no time in developing a taste for sweeta babi s insidious discovery 
the author of this book does not believe the persians invented wine india has a much older narrative it is related that bala rama the 
 hindu bacchus married an old maid named revati who had been a virgin for four million years she was so tall that when the hands were 
 13 
as a means of restoring or stimulating the powers of life in thehuman frame exhausted by disease or weakened by a disturbed nutrition the moderate use of genuine wines is unequalled in nature 
 justus yon liebig chemist ~~~ 
clapped seven times the greeting could just be heard by her bala raffia invoked the aid of suradevi the hindu goddess of wine and the honeymoon turned out most successfully 
but you can t believe most of these old stories when put in the test tube polarization turns left 
you have to put faith in the yarn about noah however because much subsequent history is tinged by it the centuries old patriarch when he tripped down 
 the gangplank of the ark found the water polluted water water everywhere but not a drop to drink he refused to quench his thirst with the element in 
 which so many humans and other animals had drowned and decayed he knew something about hygiene did noah so he planted himself a vineyard and waited every 
 viticulturist knows it takes from three to four years to get a crop from a new vineyard but noah waited and oh what athirst he built up finally 
 the day arrived he drank his fill and full was he he went to sleep at the foot of a tree in a state of nudity his three sons came and took a look at 
 him shem and japheth covered him with their mantles ham stood by and laughed when noah woke up he made inquiries and he changed ham into a black 
 man millenia afterwards this act resulted in a great civil war in america followed by a dispute between italy and ethiopia who can foretell the 
 trouble yet to come ? the black man feels more poignant pain and pleasure than any other of noah s descendants doubtless because his black skin

 arthur brisbane ~~ keeps such things inside he is not a wine drinker maybe because of the trick his ancestor played him he wants something stronger 
one of the famous stories of wine concerns the origin of the noted italian brand est est although it involves the death of a bishop of the church the anecdote is amusing the bishop a german named defoucris  f/p code disconnect  2.1.  3.  4.  4.1.  4.2.  4.3.  4.4.  5. 
set out on a pilgrimage to rome he was fond of good wine and to make sure on this point he sent his trusted valet ahead of him by a day s post with instructions that he should taste the wine at every place 
where he stopped and write under the bush the evergreen branch which the tavern keeper puts above his door the word ’est ‘it is if it was tolerable and ‘est est’ ‘it is it is if it was very good but when he 
found it indifferent he should not write up anything defoucris’ valet arrived at monte fiascone and approved so much of the wine that he wrote up est est the bishop found the wine so palatable that he got 
drunk the next day he got drunk again and the day after and the days following he got drunk and drunk and drunk ad infinitum finally he died 0£ acute alcoholism as they say at bellevue hospital new york and 
he never saw the pope at all small matter that for he passed to immortality both above and below they buried him gave the wine the talismanic name est est and erected a monument which to this day bears the 
epitaph which his efficient valet wrote

wine has been the theme 0£ countless poets from anacreon to long fellow first of all in rank is omar khayyam the persian almost unknown to the world until fitzgerald gave him immortality by his exceedingly 
free translation of the rubaiyat a better text than the original the poets of greece rome italy france germany and england through many ages produced a literature which would fill many volumes the english 
with perfect anglo saxonism were prone to drink and moralize some unknown bard wrote this 
good wine makes good blood 
good blood causeth good humors good humors cause 
good thoughts good thoughts bring forth good works 
good work carry a man to heaven 

ergo 
good wine carrieth a man to heaven 
another unknown poet with a skill worthy of hogarth put forth this 
three cups of wine a prudent man may take 
the first of them for constitution s sake 
t he second to the girl he loves the best 
the third and last to lull him to his rest 
t hen home to bed but if a fourth he pours

good wine is an aid to digestion and a promoter of good cheer idon’t think anyone will find ii sound argument against the moderate use of it 
 george ade 
 ~~ 
that is the cup of folly and not ours 
loud noisy talking on the fifth attends 
the sixth breeds feuds and falling out of friends 
seven begets blows and faces stained with gore 
eight and the wa tch patrol breaks open the door 

 mad with the ninth another cup goes round 
and the swilled sot drops senseless on the ground 

the english poet cowley in his imitation of anacreon 
propounds this impassioned poser 
the thirsty earth soaks up the rain 
and drinks and gapes for drink again 
the plants suck in the earth and are 
with constant drinking fresh and fair 

 the sea itself which one would think 
should have but little need of drink 
drinks twice ten thousand rivers up 
so filled that they o erflow the cup 
the busy sun and one would guess 
by s drunken fiery face no less 
drinks up the sea and when he s done

 the moon and stars drink up the sun 
they drink and dance by their own light 
they drink and revel all the night 
nothing in nature s sober found 
but an eternal health goes round 
fill up the bowl then fill it high 
fill all the glasses there for why 
should every creature drink but i ? 
why man of morals tell me why ?

i hail with joy for i am temperance man and friend of temperance 1 hail with joy the efforts that are being made to raise wine in this country i believe that when

american literature and statesmanship lag no whit behind europe in tribute 
george washington made wine from the scuppernong grape at mount vernon and sold it andrew jackson although he preferred fiery 
 spirits kept his ménage stocked with choice wines but henry clay seems to have been the best friend of the grape in the 
 early years of the nineteenth century when william robert prince proprietor of the linnean botanic garden of long island 
 new york wrote in 1830 a treatise on the vine the first great book on american viticulture he dedicated it to henry clay 
 to henry clay of kentucky sir it is with sentiments of gratification and pride that i inscribe this work to one who through life has been the undeviating patron of american industry whose name is interwoven 
 with the various objects connected with the development of our national resources and whose unwearied efforts have been devoted to imparting that impulse too our domestic pursuits which 
 is best calculated to advance the high destinies of our republic the knowledge of these interesting facts carry the conviction with them of the peculiar appropriateness of the present dedication 
 but sir the additional circumstance that you more than thirty years ago united with many of our fellow citizens in forming an association for promoting the cultivation of the vine in our country

thomas jefferson was a champion of wine as a moralist as a patriot and as one deeply interested in the health and vigor of the american people writing from monticello on december 18 1818 to m de neville he said 
 i rejoice as a moralist at the prospect of a reduction of the duties on wine by our national legislature it is an error to view a tax on that liquor as 
 merely a tax on the rich it is a prohibition of its use to the middling class of our citizens and a condemnation of them to the poison of whisky which 
 is desolating their houses no nation is drunken where wine is cheap and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common

when they are dry sufficiently shrivelled pluck the grapes from the stalks throw them into a cask and make the first must if they have well drained put them at the end of six days into a vessel and press them

the history of wine making in america reads like a romance whose hero is discovery leading from darkness into light the juice of the grape 
the first man to discover the wine making qualities of the native american grape was tyrker the german foster father of lief ericson who accompanied him on his famous voyage of 1 000 a d tyrker whom lief greatly loved got 
 separated from his fellows and was missing for a long time when he returned lief received him most joyously according to an old icelandic manuscript entitled the finding of wineland the good tyrker was in lively spirits 
 he was most supremely happy at first he talked rapidly in german and rolled his eyes then he began to speak the northern tongue he had found vines and grapes such as grew in his native germany whereupon lief called 
 the country wineland and he took on board a cargo of grapes one can feel sure that a part of the cargo was in liquid form and that old tyrker was the first wine maker who ever practiced the art in the united states

actors when the colonists made their settlements and saw the native wild grapes growing so luxuriantly in the woods they conceived the idea of bringing over the european grapes this they did with many 
varieties always the result was the same the vines grew for three or four years then withered and died the colonist would get a cask or two of wine discouraged he would quit someone else and there were 
frenchmen and swiss who tried it would plant more european vines and they would wither and die practically the only american wine that was made came from the juice of wild grapes picked in the forests it 
occurred to no one to domesticate these indigenous grapes give them cultivation and sunshine in open fields so as to improve their quality the palate of the colonist was used to the grapes of europe and he 
called the native grapes musty and foxy he wouldn t experiment with them the wild grapes grew in profusion so why wouldn t the european varieties ? he couldn t know the reason darwin was as yet unborn and the 
science of entomology scarcely existed so how could he know that the soft roots of europe s vines were consumed by the tiny devouring worms of the phylloxera and that the leaves shoots and grapes were being 
sucked to death by minute parasitic plants called fungi ? how could he know that the european grape had never before contended against these pests which were native american and that the american grapes in all their varieties had 
 31 
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine untothose that be of heavy hearts proverbs ~~ fought with them for millions of years and that finally the law of selection or the law of the 
survival of the fittest had given them such hard roots that the phylloxera could not injure them and that in other ways they had been immunized against the fungus dis eases ? when years after in the middle of 
the last century american grape fungi were accidentally carried to europe french experts to their immortal glory dis covered they could be killed with flowers of sulphur or with copper sulphate and gave 
bordeaux mixture to the world and made a decade later when phylloxera crossed the atlantic another momentous discovery that european grapes grafted on american stock were impervious to this devastating pest

founded a company at spring mill pennsylvania and who announced that he had brought from the old world two varieties of grapes that were fitted to american conditions the madeira and the cape they actually 
proved fitted but they were not what he said they were they were true americans hard rooted and immune to fungus following him came the swiss john james dufour who formed an ambitious vineyard project in 
kentucky and who acquired plants from legaux including some of the cape grape afterwards known as the alexander alone of all these varieties

finally came john adlum who urged the cultivation of the alexander grape and who disseminated the na tive catawba of which long fellow sang and which was the first superlative 
 american wine grape and who at the stipulation of thomas jefferson published in 1823 cultivation of the vine the first american book on american grapes to quote dr hedrick 
 seven years afterwards the naturalist and great nurseryman william robert prince published his immortal treatise on the vine which marked as notable a victory for native vines 
 as the battle of yorktown did for political america he listed about seventy varieties of indigenous grapes and freed america from the worship of its european vine fetish

 legislature of the state authorized a far flung tour of europe by colonel haraszthy for the purpose of gathering information selecting vines and studying the methods of the 
 great wine districts of the continent he purchased about 200 000 vine cuttings embracing about 1 400 varieties for experiment and wrote a 420 page book which was published

do with wine varieties alone and for convenience the author has divided america into four divisions the east the south california and similar pacific coast terrain and canada the varieties mentioned are not 
quite those that would have been included in a volume written before prohibition the sumptuary inhibitions of this iniquitous law put viticulturists and scientists on edge more study was given to the making 
of wine and the production of fine wine grapes in this baneful epoch than is realized and as a result america is now ready to compete with the world this is the first book so far as the author knows to bring

adlum about 1823 was used by nicholas longworth in the early years of the last century for the production of white wine at cincinnati and is still the basis for the finest of white wines and of champagne in 
the famous finger lakes region of new york its color is a brilliant red but the skins contain no dissolvable pigment in early stages of fermentation the wine is slightly pinkish but after a year it becomes a 
glorious golden color favorably grown its juice will contain from 20 to 23 percent of sugar iona this is mentioned second because many hold it to be the most perfect of american wine grapes it originated in 
1885 and dr hedrick thinks it contains blood of both the labrusca native american and of vinifera european delicious to the taste it de­velops in fermentation an aroma like that of arabian balm balm in gilead 
which fills a room with its fragrance emanating from the glass slowly so that he who drinks it is prone not to swallow but to smell as he nurses it along like the catawba it is red in color but produces a 
golden wine its juice under the most favorable condition with enough units of sunshine will test from 21 to 26 percent of sugar delaware difficult to grow in some locations

adam champ agne this is america s grape of romance alva adam farmer of hammonton new jersey was hunting sixty years ago and found a grape in the south jersey swamps which was so good to eat that he marked the 
tree upon which it grew and the following spring transplanted the vine to his garden decade after decade he grew it and enjoyed eating it when prohibition came he made cuttings and planted a vineyard the wine 
losing the musky taste of the ripe grape developed a flavor identical with that of champagne its culture has spread in new jersey delaware maryland and pennsylvania it will not ripen perfectly north of these 
states its skin is amber and the wine at a year old assumes a beautiful golden color it will probably rank as the most productive white wine grape of the middle atlantic states 
 the above grapes are in a class by themselves also used in the production of white wines in the east and by the east is included the states of the so called middle west embracing missouri and illinois are 
the following which also do well in the south they produce white not golden wines very much resembling rhenish

elvlra this productive grape is used for light colored white wine from new york to missouri and its product resembles that of the 
 rhine it grows well in the south etta this variety introduced in missouri in 1879 is similar to elvira of which it is a seedling 
missouri reisling produced in missouri in 1870 it ranks with the above varieties as a wine producer 
noah introduced in 1869 at nauvoo illinois this grape is similar to the above it is good for the middle north or the south 
 also in a class by itself stands the following variety 
ontario this is the best white wine grape originated by the new york experiment station to the taste it is nectar being a hybrid of the native labrusca and europe 
 s vinifera its vine is vigorous its american blood frees it from disease the ripe berry is green tinged with gold where the sun kisses it in favorable years 
 it will develop 25 percent of sugar and its wine is a greenish silver like that of chablis but even better than this famed french product maturing early its vintage 
 comes in the last week of august or the first week of september which means that the wine maker s vats can be clear of it before other sorts claim them 
 all the above are white wine varieties but white wine can be made of red grapes crush them press them quickly before fermentation has a

 sorts that are used mainly to enhance the color and body of other wines one third part of cynthjana clevener or diogenes can make a red wine out of a white wine manufactured from any of the varieties mentioned above 
cynthiana or norton it is disputed whether these are two varieties o r one botanical characteristics are the same the wine is indistinguishable but the fact remains that cynthiana ripens two weeks ahead of norton which makes 
 it more desirable in new jersey pennsylvania and new york the wine slightly wild in taste when added to the wine made of sheridan or eumelan produces something that ranks with bur gundy or bordeaux and maybe better 
clevener this began to be raised in the vicinity of egg harbor city new jersey about 1870 like cynthiana and norton it produces a wine so deep in color 
 you can scarcely see through a glass when blended with light red wines the result is a product not much less in quality than when cynthiana is used 
diogenes or ironclad this old variety which botanists declare to be the hardiest of all american

 amaury de casanove ~~ grapes ranks with clevener for its color and blending qualities it imparts a slightly wild taste 
ives this makes a very deep red wine but not so deep as the above varieties discovered in 1840 by henry ives near cincinnati it was used by nicholas longworth at cincinnati in the 
 manufacture of port when mingled half and half with the lighter red wines it produces something that is almost indistinguishable from the claret of bordeaux and maybe better 
clinton this grape makes a wine of a slightly deeper color than ives but not of so high quality alone it tastes damnably but when blended not more than 20 percent with light red wines it helps to produce a wine of claret quality 
 the above varieties produce coloring agents but 
there is still another which is now in the process of 
introduction 

westfield this is the newest production of the new york state experiment station and is likely with ontario and sheridan to survive as the greatest achievement of dr hedrick at geneva and of dr gladwin at fredonia there are perhaps 
 only 300 plants in existence of which the author through the courtesy of dr hedrick and dr gladwin has about 100 for experimental purposes the cynthiana norton the clevener the ironclad the ives and the clinton impart a wild

better be merry with the fruitful grape than sadden afternone or bitter fruit 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~~ taste to the blended wine but westfield a hybrid of european and american stocks has deep color without the handicap of offensive taste in a few years it 
 is not disseminated yet it will begin to play its part in the creation of great american red wines its description is inserted here more for the sake of the future than the present 
 the grapes which produce light red wine come next 
sheridan the author is not certain whether this will rank as the first of eastern american wine grapes or whether that place will be shared by ontario silvery white or westfield deep red disseminated by dr hedrick in 1920 as 
 a grape to take the place of concord it has proved to be more productive than concord and to have better growing characteristics concord never will test more than from 13 to 16 percent of sugar sheridan will go to 22 or 
 23 its wine is perfect except for color when one fourth part of cynthiana norton clevener or diogenes is added its color is rectified becoming a beautiful ruby the main point however is its flavor and aroma it emanates the 
 essence of the raspberry as does burgundy and when mingled with the pure wine of the westfield which contains no wildness it is likely to produce a wine that will surpass anything that france can send across the atlantic

 concord foxy the experts say those whose taste is based on the standards of europe but a fair wine for blending can be made from the despised concord as will be described in the chapter on 
 wine making many false notions have been promulgated and the worthlessness of the concord is one of them americans have one taste europeans another let the american taste have its chance 
eumelan aside from sheridan perhaps the best light red wine in america comes from the eumelan grape it isn t liked by vineyardists 
 because it cannot pollinate itself and because it cannot be grown from cuttings and must be reproduced by layering

 woods wild then it was put in vineyards high wide when harvest came sheets were put on the ground and the vines were shaken the grapes showering down they were so full of sugar that the fingers on 
 handling them became sticky but they made a delicious wine the musky taste of which disappeared with age george washington made it as did nearly every patrician of the south at the present time scuppernong

 tannin in the skins and enough tartaric acid to preserve it from wine diseases and its must possesses from 18 to 20 percent of sugar the author has 
 tasted its wine which is of the claret type full bodied and fragrant the use of this grape will help the south to build up a great wine industry

lomanto perfect in acid content this grape producing a claret type wine is good either for the gulf states or for the north for further description see canada 
fern munson this is the south s catawba flavored grape but its wine is deep red munson originated it in 1893 there is plenty of tannin and tartaric acid 
america this is one of munson s best wine grapes introduced in 1885 it resists the heat of the south and the cold of the north its wine is intensely red the sugar content of the must is 
 very high and if raised to 28 percent after using the saccharometer it can be aged into a very good natural port containing 16 percent of alcohol without ‘fortifying with brandy 
xlnta a munson product of 1893 this grape grown only in the south produces a sprightly deep red wine 
 it will be noted that all the grapes mentioned so far in the third category of the south make red wine suggestions for white wine follow

 white wine it ripens only in the south herbemont this old grape was in cultivation in georgia before the revolution its berries are brown reddish black but the skins have only a trace of pigment 
 it has a high sugar content and sufficient tartaric acid after the first fermentation the new wine appears slightly pink but this within a year becomes amber and after two years a beautiful golden 
 thereby classifying it as a white wine grape given the proper degree of alcohol after using the saccharometer it can produce a southern sauterne herbemont s northern sister is delaware

 old french poem ~ 
brief but explicit pamphlet by dr frederic t bioletti there will be a brief passage on california in the succeeding chapter on wine making in this book but it must not be considered 
 conclusive following is a designation of varieties used in the manufacture of red wines in california and following it a corresponding designation for the making of white wines 
mission this variety is mentioned first because it is the historic grape of california brought there by the earliest fathers of the church probably by junipero sera himself it is pure european but nobody knows what it was called in the 
 old world once says bioletti it was the only grape for white or red wine dry or sweet or for eating grown in california its berries are black carrying pigment red wine is made by fermenting fully on the skins white wine by pressing 
 it as soon as crushed better sorts are taking its place except for the manufacture of sherry it has gained immortality from the fact that it has produced from a plant set at carpinteria california by a spanish woman in 1842 the largest 
 grape vine in the world the trunk of this viticultural giant is eight feet in cir cumference its branches cover half an acre and it produced in 1895 according to the u s agricultural yearbook of 1907 more than ten tons of grapes

 canada so far has been the red headed stepchild of american wine making but under the aegis of dr e f palmer director of the ontario horticultural experiment station at vineland ontario it now promises to 
take a place among the viticultural countries of the world t he growing of grapes is almost entirely confined to the province of ontario ontario produces 99 5 percent of the wine of all canada in 1900 there 
were 49 wineries in ontario with 373 793 in capital invested in 1932 there were 49 wineries with a capi­tal of 7 284 862 canada had its handicap of prohibition but as in america the grip of the holy people 
has now been relaxed wine now a in the past is almost exclu sively confined to the product of the concord and the niagara grape both of these varieties under canadian climatic conditions are exceedingly low 
in sugar content averaging 13 percent and high in tartaric acid to make endurable wine much sugar has to be added and much water artificially sugared to overcome the acid t he wine has not been altogether

 comes from the short days of september and october which do not pro­vide enough sunshine to convert the starch in the leaves into sugar for the grapes a listing of canadian wine grapes present and prospective follows 
concord ripening perfectly but of low sugar content unless a pound or a pound and a half of cane sugar be added to the must the wine is so deficient in alcohol 7 or 8 percent that the product is susceptible afterward despite all ordinary 
 precautions to vinegar fermentation if raised in sugar content a fair red wine can be made by blending with other grapes however the addition of cane sugar may impart a slightly bitter taste to the product see chapter on wine making 
niagara this grape will ripen but it has no more sugar than concord and its wine has a flavor that reminds one of the taste of listerine

implements 
carpenter can not work without tools n either can a man make wine satisfactorily without utensils these may vary from the simplest sort of outfit to the amazing power presses and combined crushers – stemmers ­pressers of 
the big wineries this book does not concern the latter it is primarily for the small wine maker and if he in the course of years graduates into a big wine maker he must perforce call in the services of an expert such as the 
 winery implement houses stand ready to provide for him below is a list of the appliances which the home wine maker and the small winery require some of them are indispensable for the former and all of them for the latter 
cellar this very strictly is not an implement but a location but it comes first and no man should try to produce wine without a 
 cellar to provide a low and even temperature this subject will be treated at length in the chapter headed cellar and bottle 
fermenting vats these may take the form of large pottery jars or of kegs and barrels with the heads removed the more ambitious will perhaps want

regular fermenting vats made of oak or redwood whose tops are considerably smaller than their bottoms and which can be obtained from barrel 
 factories in all three cases heavy muslin cloths should be provided which can be closely fastened with sections of clothes line so as 
 to hold in the vat a part of the carbon dioxide arising from fermentation all vats should be placed on heavy wooden frames or platforms 
 18 inches high so as to facilitate the siphoning or drawing off of the wine when the first fermentation is complete as indicated by 
the sinking of the skins siphon wells these can be constructed of large mesh wire one fourth inch heavily galvanized they are made round five or six inches in diameter and the joining can be 
 done with fine copper wire they should be just high enough to reach beyond the top of the vat they should be covered with a single layer of cheesecloth sewed to the frame and to the bottom 
siphons these are made of rubber tubing of one half inch inside measurement and of a length sufficient to reach from the bottom of the well over the top of the vat and to a vessel on the 
 floor they should be tied in two or three places to a piece of heavy straight wire galvanized or copper the latter preferred long enough to reach from the bottom of the well to six 
 56 who drinks more shall drink less zipoli ~~ inches above the top of the vat the tube must not go to the end of the wire and in operation the tube can be 
 made to slide upward so as to avoid clogging with the murk that is likely to gather at the bottom of the well and which must be thrown out every so often 
crusher this consists of a wooden hopper at the bottom of which are two rollers of non corroding metal or rubber which on operation of 
 the crank revolve in opposite directions these rollers can be adjusted so that the grapes passing between them will be thoroughly 
 crushed without any seed being broken there are arms at the bottom of the crusher which enable it to be securely placed across 
 the top of the vat a crusher can be bought at almost every hardware store at a modest price don t get a little toy one 
press this standard implement upright and operated by hand may be bought cheaply enough at hardware stores or winery supply houses it were best not to purchase a tiny affair but a good and heavy one 
 the more ambitious may obtain for more money pressers operated by electrical power or centrifugal pressers which look like torpedoes the smaller of which may be operated by hand the larger by power 
vessels you will require buckets preferably enameled or of copper although galvanized ware will do of three gallons capacity and if possible narrower 
 at the top that the bottom in which the siphoned or pressed wine can be carried to the storage barrels three might do but four would be better

measuring vessels for the sake of accuracy in measuring you should have at least one u s standard gallon measure preferably of copper if you have u s bonded winery possession of measuring vessels is obligatory 
funnels large sized funnels are required for pouring the wine from buckets into barrels preferably of copper but galvanized ware will do don t get small ones or you will regret it 
gauging sticks and wantage rods these are not necessary unless you are operating under government license combined they enable you or the government inspector to determine the exact amount of wine in a full or a partly full barrel 

saccharometer this is absolutely necessary for without it you cannot ascertain the percentage of sugar in your wine must it will cost you at an instrument shop or a winery supply house from 2 50 to 4 00 
acidimeter this is not absolutely necessary unless you are operating a u s bonded winery it is useful however because it enables 
 you to ascertain the exact amount of acid in your grape must or wine a little practice will make you proficient in its use

wine making 
heoretically the making of wine is as easy as rolling off a log to borrow a pioneer expression wine is the fermented juice of grapes crush your grapes let them ferment and you have wine but try it at every stage in the making of wine an 
enemy lurks beside the real wine yeasts saccharomyces ellipsoideus of many benevolent varieties which actually create wine by transforming the sugar in your must into about 52 percent potable alcohol 2 percent glycerine 
 which is a higher alcohol and 44 percent carbonic dioxide gas which goes up in the air the other 2 percent nourishing the yeast there are malignant yeasts and bacilli which tend to undo your work and ruin your product 
 somebody wrote many decades ago that sugar divided itself in fermentation into 50 percent alcohol and 50 percent carbonic gas this fallacy like many other fallacies in grape culture 
 and wine making has been repeated by subsequent writers there are scores of such mistakes they will persist as long as writers write from other writers books instead of experience 
 61 
wine that maketh glad the heart of man psalms ~~ the bad yeasts are called by the scientists saccharomyces apiculatus mycoderma vini of many strains torula yeasts saccharomyces anomalus saccharomyces 
ludwigii saccharomyces cerevisaie beer yeast saccharomyces pasteurianus now don t be scared when fermentation starts it is estimated that there are 1 000 000 cells of malevolent yeast to every single cell of 
real wine yeast however cheer up the one good cell kills off the 1 000 000 in a short while when proper management is practiced the true wine yeast cells multiply marvelously fast and in two or three days 
when fermentation is active there are 6 000 000 000 of their cells in a fluid ounce of the juice the problem is to produce such conditions that the true yeast will quickly raise the alcoholic content to 10 
 percent then the battle is won if proper subsequent management is employed then there are moulds that destroy wine like the pencillium glaucum or green mould which develops on broken grapes in unclean 
barrels and utensils next in contradistinction to yeasts and moulds which are vegetable organisms come bacilli which be long to the animal kingdom most to be feared is the vinegar bacteria but it can be 
controlled easily because it cannot exist without the presence of air and is quickly killed by sulphur no acetic acid vinegar can form in a cask which is kept bung full of wine and has been subjected before 
use to the burning of sulphur but if these precautions are not followed this bacteria can attack the alcohol in your wine it is a toper and wants 
 62 
never did a great man hate good wine rabelais ~~ nothing else and transform it into vinegar in this connection it may be noted that if the sugar content of must is raised to 26 percent thereby producing a 
wine with 14 percent alcohol neither the vinegar bacteria nor any other disease can do much to harm your wine even under medium adverse conditions other bacteria deleterious to wine are the tourne organism 
which produces a mousy odor and taste it is dangerous be cause unlike the vinegar bacteria it grows in the absence of air which gives little trouble in dry wines containing no sugar mannite bacteria and the 
bacteria which produces slimy wines 
now sit up and listen wine maker the foregoing paragraphs sound discouraging but they need not alarm you heed this cleanliness is your salvation keep your cellar and your fermenting room scrupulously clean 
use whitewash and disinfectants sulphur your barrels and your fermenting vats immerse your bungs in boiling water every cloth every utensil scald with boiling water every time before you use it pour boiling 
water through your siphons every two weeks fill vessels with sulphur and disinfect your cellar be clean be prophylactic and you never will lose an ounce of wine this advice is based on experience the author 
out of hatred of the sumptuary laws of his country be gan making wine fifteen years ago he planted an experimental vineyard and he consulted experts and he never has lost either from wild yeasts moulds or 
bacteria a cubic centimeter of wine 
some writers hold that wine should not be ameliorated 
 63 
it warms the blood adds luster to the eyes andwine nil love have ever been allies qvid 
 ~~ by the addition of cane sugar which in 48 hours mixed with the grape becomes grape sugar but if no sugar is used in the case of grapes which normally are deficient in that element or which in bad seasons 
are deficient so that only 13 to 15 percent of sugar is present the wine maker will have a highly acid wine of 7 to 8 percent alcohol nobody on earth can keep such a wine from spoiling except by 
pasteurization whic h impairs the quality when a variety of wine grape yields a sugar content of 22 to 24 percent it is best to leave it alone when it is lower in sugar its content must be raised to 25 or 26 
 percent which will yield a wine of 14 percent alcohol by volume this is done as follows estimate the amount of juice you have exclusive of skins and seeds grapes differ greatly in pro­portions measure your 
sugar content by means of the saccharometer then heighten it to 25 or 26 percent by the addition of cane sugar on the basis that one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will raise the content 9 percent thus 
if you have must that has 17 percent of sugar the addition of one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will give you a must of 26 percent sugar producing a wine of 14 percent alcohol 
some writers advise the amelioration of super acid wine must with water the addition of water tends to destroy the quality of any wine and the method never should be employed except when a bad season has 
caused the must when tested by the acidimeter to show more than 1 percent of acid in such a case one gallon of

let those who drink not but austerely dine 
dry up in law the muses smell of wine horace 

 ~ water may be added to five gallons of juice carefully calculated and this gallon of water must be sweetened with 2 1/2 pounds of 
 sugar the normal must should previously have been raised to 25 percent of sugar all of this is permitted by the government in its 
regulations 
the normal eastern wine grape varies from 4 percent to 8 percent in acid content instead of adding sugared water a process which is called gallizing after 
 dr gall a german scientist it would be better to blend at the completion of fermentation wines having too much acid with those having too little an 
 alternative would be the keeping of the wines in casks for a number of years as the french do during which time the superfluous tartaric acid would be 
 cast down to the botto m in the shape of crystals making the aged wine mellow and perfect can americans have the patience for this ? they ought to have 
keep water out of your wine for water can better be used in bathtubs 0r to sprinkle lawns 
having praised wine told its history described grapes that act as the tcraw material listed the needed imple ments and presented certain sanitary and ameliorating principles the next thing is to proceed to actual methods 
wandering along according to his own whim the author is going to divide processes into three categories first the traditional method 
 which originated in ancient times and reached its perfection before pasteur came on the scene second the advanced method 
 65 
they eat and drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy milton ~ which takes in on a simplified scale some of pasteur s discoveries and third the modern method of the latter very little will be 
said because it belongs to the big wineries and the experts at this point however the author wants to give the reader a vision of the future pasteur believed that alcohol was produced in vinous fermentation 
by the action of the living yeast cells on the sugar in the must if i am asked he said in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed and what is its real cause i reply that i am completely 
ignorant of it the scientist buchner disposed of pasteur s puzzlement just a few years ago he showed that fermentation was not the result of the growth of the living yeast cell but that it resulted from a 
secretion an infinitely small exudation of the yeast cell he called the secretion zymase now who knows that the scientists of the future will not be able to extract this zymase from the yeast and afterwards 
to create it synthetically so that the wine maker of the future will be able to pasteurize or defecate his juice by means of meta bisulphite and by adding the proper zymase ferment the most perfect wines the 
world has ever known a vision but who in the days of abraham lincoln could have dreamed of tele vision ? always there are enough of the true yeast cells on the skins of grapes to start fermentation they 
hibernate in the ground and are blown onto the grapes by the wind when they begin their work in the wine must 
 66 
scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendant vintage as it grows gray 
 ~ subsisting on sugar they immediately begin multiplication by means of buds which dropping off become new cells the rate of propagation is astonishing 
 and as has been said in two or three days after normal fermentation begins as many as 6 000 000 000 of them exist in an ounce of must 
the management in fermentation differs in the making of red wine and white wine but since the manufacture of the former employs most of the principles used with the latter it will be considered first 
red wine 
traditional method be sure first as a preliminary that your fermenting cellar is absolutely clean its walls should be whitewashed adding a cup of dissolved salt or alum to every two gallons of the mixture purify the floor by 
 disinfecting with chlorine or some reliable odor less commercial preparation let there be no vegetables fruits green wood or rubbish in your cellar last of all bum a few plates of sulphur in it after closing all apertures 
let every vat be scalded outside and inside with boiling water the big wineries use steam turn the vats upside down and burn just a little 
 sulphur under each scald every portion of your crusher and your press with boiling water and do the same with every other utensil 
you are now ready to proceed with the vintage 
 67 
but still the vine her ancient ruby yields and still a garden by the water blows 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~ 
grapes for red wine should be allowed to reach full ripeness but 
not become over ripe they should be harvested in bright weather 
and not before all the dew on them has evaporated the berries must 
be separated from the stems from all green grapes and from grapes 
that are rotten in any degree whatsoever or have their skins broken 
for such grapes harbor the deleterious wild yeasts and bacteria the 
manner of separation may be in two ways for the small wine 
producer 1 by hand 2 by picking each bad grape out of each 
bunch then pulling the bunch across a board from one to two inches 
thick through which long nails have been driven in rows so that the 
sharp ends stand up an inch and a half the board being carved with 
run ways through which juice may flow into the pan bucket or jar 
which you are using these operations can be performed in the open 
air on a porch or under a shed by women and children the big 
wineries of course have stemming machines but they cannot 
escape if they are conscientious the laborious task of removing the 
bad grapes 
now carry the grapes to the fermenting cellar and put them through the crusher into the vat fill the vat only three fourths full for if you fill higher the expanding mass will spillover the top tie tightly with a 
 section of clothesline heavy muslin covers over the vats twice a day thereafter remove the muslin and stir the must so that the skins floating on top will be thoroughly mixed with all the juice temperature of

 ~ 
fermenting room should be between 60 and 75 degrees fermentation raises the heat of the must and if it goes over 90 degrees 
 the wine yeast begins to die and at 100 degrees fahrenheit it is killed absolutely the vat fermentation of red wines 
 will last from 5 to 10 days the former at a cellar temperature of 75 degrees the latter at 60 degrees you will know when it is complete because the ticking sound will almost cease and the murk on top will begin to sink into the wine 
the first fermentation done the next two steps are siphoning off and pressing put the «wells to the very bottom of the vats insert the rubber siphons have your buckets ready suck on 
 the lower end of the tube until you get wine in your mouth then let the juice flow into the bucket spit the juice out for it wouldn t be good for you if you swallowed it remember 
 what new wine did to noah carry the new wine into your wine cellar and pour it through a funnel into the barrel where the secondary or slow fermentation is to take place fill within 
 three or four inches of the top then adjust your water seal before long the tup tup tup of the gas escaping through the water will make most delightful music for your ears 
at first the vat wine will flow furiously through the siphoning tube but suddenly will come a gurp and the flow will cease wait a few minutes for the well to 
 fill again this may be expedited by lifting out the well and scraping the slimy murk off the cheesecloth covering siphon once more until there is another 
 69 
truth itself doth flow in wine samuel johnson ~ gurp and keep the process going until no more juice gathers in the well try different sides of the vat 
then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation 
 occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale 
this siphoned wine will be your best wine 
 next comes pressing which yields another quality the murk seeds and skins is removed into the drum of the press and the rest of the juice is extracted put a piece of strong but not too closely woven cloth 
previously boiled in the drum monks cloth from any department store is preferable then pour in enough of the murk to bring the height to four or six inches fold the cloth over the top of the murk put in 
another section of cloth and fill it in the same manner then other sections until the drum is nearly full apply pressure until no more juice runs then remove all the sections except the bottom one and place 
them temporarily in a pan uncovering the bottom layer of murk at its top stir it until it is loose put the other layers in and do the same thing then resume pressing repeat the loosening of the murk and the

white wine 
it is a fetish long abiding that white wine has to be made from fresh juice pressed from grapes as soon as they are crushed but let the small wine maker without a power press 
 try it if he use all his muscle on the press he can hardly extract a worth while amount of juice from grapes that have not been softened by the first stages of fermentation 
however if white wine is to be made from grapes having dissolvable red pigment in them it is obligatory that as much of the white juice 
 as possible be extracted as soon as they are crushed what is left over can be put through the regular red wine fermentation

certain grapes of a pink or amber hue have no dissolvable color in the skins such as catawba iona delaware and adam champagne and despite externals cannot be classed 
 with red wine grapes they can be considered in the same category as the grapes which when ripe are green or golden green such as the ontario the elvira etc 
white wine can be made from these grapes when they are put to full fermentation on the skin and in this case the procedure is exactly that in the case of red 
 wine such wine is full bodied astringent because of its tannin and wholesomely acid because of its tartaric it cannot spoil except under bad management 
the full process of white wine making is precisely that of the red process differing not in the slightest degree there are two other traditional processes suitable for the small wine maker 
first traditional method let the grapes after being crushed ferment in vats for a day or two until the pulp is soft then 1 siphon and 2 press the residue may be allowed 
 to continue its fermentation in vats and there will result a very alcoholic heavy and highly flavored wine which managed precisely as red wine may delight the heart 
second traditional method by muscle and dexterity extract in the press as much of the juice as you can as soon as the grapes are pressed 
 ferment the residue and there will be lots of it precisely as you would for red wine the product of this residue will be

above 
after treatment of both traditional methods the juice 
mentioned in both the preceding paragraphs should not be fermented 
in vats it should be transferred to barrels filled three fourths with 
water seals immediately inserted both the first furious fermentation 
and the later secondary slow fermentation can take place in the same 
barrels when the first fermentation is through the barrels should be 
filled to within three or four inches of the top from the contents of 
other barrels or demijohns and the second fermentation should 
proceed still under the water seals it is difficult to tell when the 
primary fermentation ends and the secondary begins so it is best to 
fill the barrels when the bubbling of the water seals becomes slow 
advanced method this is exactly the same as for red wine except that under the first traditional method for white wine the whole starter skins and pulp should be added to the grapes as soon as 
 crushed whereas in the second traditional method only the juice from the starter should be added to the freshly pressed juice of the grape see red wine paragraph entitled advanced method 
modern method this is applicable only to freshly pressed juice defecated by means of potassium metabisulfite and filtered pure yeast culture is then added only big wineries can do it

inside by means of your sulphur cistern previously described first your barrels will be filled with new wine red or white under water seals when these water seals cease to bubble you may know that your wine 
has passed altogether through the first and secondary fermentations remove the water seals rack your wine by means of siphons into clean and sulphured barrels and fill them until the wine overflows the 
bunghole drive in the bung as often as is necessary pour in more wine so as to make it overflow the bunghole this operation is called by the french ullage it is vital because it excludes disease in the spring 
when the grapes flower there will be a slight tertiary or third fermentation and when the new grapes ripen in september or october there will be slight fourth fermentation then the wine may be considered as 
made the bungs then may be sealed with wax or paraffine ullage thereafter can be performed every six months the wine s quality can be watched and when the proper time comes you can put it in bottles the 
process of fining is seldom needed in the states east of the rocky mountains usually three or four rackings of the wine is enough to give it brilliance however a deficiency of tannin may cause the wine to 
stay murky in this case the small wine maker can

dissolved overnight in a small quantity of wine stir these materials into the cask and in a few days the solid materials will be carried down to the lees bigger wineries will use filtration or centrifuging 
machines with less injury to the bouquet and flavor of the wine racking consists of siphoning the wine off the lees into another cask two or three rackings are usually sufficient these should be made in bright weather 
don t buy cheap bottles and don t buy cheap corks when it comes to bottling choose a bright sunshiny day put your corks in water brought to a boil to soften them but do not boil 
 them if you have strong fingers you can insert the corks until their tops reach just below the tops of the bottles however a corking machine is desirable and quite cheap 
when your wine thoroughly matured in the oak is bottled then comes bottle management they are laid on their sides in tiers so that the corks are always in contact with the wine in the barrels your wine will 
have been ameliorated because crystals of tartaric acid will have been thrown down to the bottom in bottles there will be no more of this but something infinitely more important will occur the acids working 
on the alcohol will produce in the bottles what scientific men call esters or ethers the most important one being the oenanthic ester wine aroma in five or six years american wine in the bottle should reach its acme of excellence

hog first concord method gather the despised concord when it is fully ripe not over ripe test it by the saccharometer which will not register more than 13 to 16 percent of sugar and raise its sugar content 
to 20 percent which will deliver to you approximately a wine of 11 percent alcohol when the second fermentation is complete drink it without delay be cause if you don ' t you ' ll have nothing but vinegar or 
worse second concord method as soon as you crush the grapes press out what white juice you can raise the sugar content of this to 22 percent treat exactly as white wine the residue you can ferment as in the

ferment as previously described for red wine blend with cynthiana norton clevener diogenes r any other intensely red wine fourth concord method raise the sugar content to 29 or 30 percent macerate the stems 
as described above ferment in the vats until the murk sinks when it is in the casks add some caramel sugar burnt until it is brown black some cinnamon some licorice or aniset just a little glycerine some oil 
of lemon a little calamus some tartaric acid if the wine is too flat establish all the proportions by experiment and if you can add enough brandy or alcohol to give the wine 22 percent alcoholic content and 
this if you properly age it will be as good port as you can get from europe at 2 00 the quart and without an injurious element in it sherry iona catawba delaware and adam champagne wine in the east can be 
transformed into sherry raise the must to 28 percent of sugar which will deliver a wine of 16 percent alcohol in the follow ing summer after its production in the fall expose it to high temperatures either 
in direct sunshine protected with heavy blankets at night or in attics that grow super heated by the sunshine on the roof if this high temperature be kept up for four months all of the wine

come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used 
 shakespeare will become rich like sherry and some of the casks will produce rancio the all important ingredient of sherry from jerez in spain jerez became in english sherries in california the wine from 
mission and palomino grapes treated to this hot amelioration produces the same results however sherry to be like spanish sherry should have brandy added to it at various stages of heating until at the end its 
alcoholic content will be about 21 percent also some burnt sugar of course sherry can be perfected by the use of sherry flavor now on the market but don t do it 
port this is a generic name for a dark or tawny red wine highly alcoholized by the addition of brandy it became the first wine of england because of the treaty that lord methuen made with portugal to spite 
france but when is port actually port ? to use a gilbertian term its purity has been «what never ? well hardly ever americans using a dark red wine whose fermentative juice has been raised to 29 percent can 
produce a wine registering 16% percent of alcohol by means of brandy or pure grain alcohol this can be raised to 22 degrees or 24 degrees by the addition of cinnamon licorice aniset capsicum cassia quassia 
calamus lemon oil burnt sugar and other things a really perfect imitation of port can be produced

in all ages of the world in sacred and profane history the abuse not the use of wine has been condemned cyrus redding 1851 filtered and fortified with 
 brandy about 18 or 19 percent until fermentation is impossible then sent to the eastern markets it is not wine but it is a nice sweet drink for ladies 
champagne the making of this wine involves a highly complicated and expensive process that cannot interest the readers of this book it is true that a 
 pseudo champagne can be produced from any good white wine by means of gas from a carbonic torpedo like soda water or by putting into the bottle a 
 little dry ice such champagne is worthless it will sparkle for three or four minutes ­whereas real champagne will effervesce for half an hour anyone 
 actually interested in the production of real champagne is invited to communicate with the author in care of the orange judd publishing company

the repeal of prohibition was the signal for the appearance of a number of very fine and sophisticated books on the consumption 
 and connoisseurship of wine they were delightful in the reading they said one particular wine should be drunk with one
~ 
particular kind of food that another wine went with another course 
and that still another sort of wine went with another sort of food 
that red meat and chicken and some sort of cheese required red 
wine as did spa ghetti that sherry accompanied soup that fish 
required white wine that champagne was appropriate to any sort of 
food that sweets needed a cordial wine like sauterne etc etc 
etc 

these picturesque and entertaining books repeated the dicta of chefs and maitres d hotel for a hundred and more years somebody first put it in print and then it was repeated over and over again by subsequent writers 
 the directions white wine for this red wine for that sherry for this port for that champagne for everything cordials for sweets have been repeated so many times that they have become a sort of parrots jamboree

the writers of these books were talking to rich customers who 
in the world serves all these european wines at dinner parties either 
at their homes or at restaurants except city slickers and men of 
great wealth or city salesmen who are trying to please out of town 
buyers ? the instruction in these books does not belong to the little 
wine maker for whom this book was written if the little fellow the 
only one the author cares about wants to pull off a state party 
having for his guests the marchioness quiff quaff the duke of 
down down herr hitler signor mussolini the prince of wales 
stalin and the emperor of japan it were best that he call in a caterer 
who will provide the proper glasses the proper wines and the proper 
food he can get all this for 2 000 or 3 000 perhaps glasses ? the idea that their shape has anything to do with the enjoyment of wine is simply bunk and no american citizen with 
 any ability to think should give the matter his attention such things belong only to the imaginations of the aesthetes what does amount to something however is the color 
 0 f the glass wine should never be poured into a glass of any other color than pure crystal which means no color at all talleyrand in his historic dictum has told us to look 
 at the wine first and enjoy its color to lift it to the nostril and enjoy the bouquet then to convey it to the mouth and enjoy the taste through the crystal glass you can

the first dukes of burgundy established vineyards on their own ac­count and we learn from their ancient ordinances how much theyprided themselves on the possession 
 of the finest wine countries in chris­tendom and the duke of burgundy was often designated by the title of prince of good wines william robert prince 1830 
 enjoy the color whether it be red as the ruby have the sparkle of the garnet present the precious yellow of gold the pure white of rhenish or the greenish silver of the wine made from the ontario grape 
the aesthetes are right on one point a heavy wine with much aroma should be served in a large glass filled half way twirl such a glass and you will get all the bouquet 
to debunk the wine glass is one thing to debunk the idea of the connoisseur writer that wine in america should be served with meals and not otherwise is another yet it ought not to be difficult 
the great mass of americans have always drunk wine as a between meals beverage an intoxicant if you like they care not at all for it as a fluid to wash down foods as do the 
 french and the italians for an hour or two before dinner the american will want to drink wine but when wine is set before him at dinner he will take very little of it the 
 author of this book has tried it out at his home on college professors newspaper editors publishers scientists authors of best sellers and many others they wanted their wine 
 before not dur ing the meal white wine with fish ? the glasses were untouched red wine with chicken or beef ? the chicken or beef was eaten but the wine was not drunk 
this advice to the american who makes his own wine and consumes it let your taste be your guide if you

if grapes were in colonial new england or wine was made from theforeign grape no great degree of success was attained wine was mad~in plenty from the wild 
 grapes in all of the new england colonies so thatit was not because of puritanical prejudices against wine that thei vine was not grown dr u p hedrick 
 can t enjoy wine and if you can t enjoy wine surely you can t drink beer with your meals call it off eat your fill and take your customary coffee but if you have 
 been drinking wine before the meal take no milk when wine or milk are mixed all the laws of chemistry smack at you before the meal drink all you ought to have of 
 wine put your best wine before your guests and give them all they ought to have but no more be a considerate host in spite of the french arid the italians never 
 mind the meal when people are hungry they are not thirsty transmogrify yourself all you like if you are american and anglo saxon you cannot escape racial facts 
neither the national government nor the state governments have ever taken the question of aiding the wine maker very much to heart the entrenched whisky and gin interests by means 
 of independent propaganda have since repeal easily swung the nation into a hard liquor country the manufacturers of beer have had their say yet the united states has no nook or 
 portion which will not produce wine and the united states is almost as big as all europe combined 3 738 393 square miles as compared with europe s 3 776 700 the isothermal line that 
 cuts the great northern portion of europe off from wine production does not touch the united states though it excludes half of europe in the whole of its vast terrain there 
 85 
in france alone the vine culture gives employment to two millions oflaborers without enumerating many subordinate mechanical branchesthat are benefited by it 
 and it is attended with immense nationaladvantages these circumstances call upon our national government to pursue the course long since adopted by france 
 william robert prince american botanist 1830 is no wine isothermal it can be the worlds greatest wine zone 
anglo saxons are a race subject to extremes they have their cycles of reform and perdition in one decade they are knocking at the doors of hell 
 in the next they are beseeching st peter for forgiveness at the gates of heaven they won t stay put but they drink even when they stand 
 before the pearly gates they either have or wish they had hip flasks it would be a great thing if they could be taught that the proper consumption 
 of pure dry wines would cause them to confront st peter with better livers and better kidneys and may hap better consciences 
if america in the course of years can be made a wine drinking country it would greatly advantage the people and moreover it would forever make impossible the return of the ogre prohibition 
 now comes the most important paragraph in this book take it to heart wine maker take it to heart having made your wine consume it with food or without as suits your whim if you want to drink it at dinner 
 let your taste be your guide in spite of savarin or anybody else but this author knows you will drink it nine cases out of ten just by itself and between meals now then don t drink too much of it

introduction 

apis are a hot topic energetically debated by businesspeople it managers and developers alike most of the excitement in the public space is about open public apis to some degree not having a public 
api today is like not having a website in the late 1990s yet for many enterprises public apis are really the least of their business concerns more important concerns include building omnichannel 
solutions innovating faster than the competition becoming a mobile enterprise or operating in a hybrid cloud environment 
apis are fundamental enablers for all these initiatives and more which is why so many different types of stakeholders are interested in them but what is an api really why is it different from an old 
school application programming interface and why should you care in principle the acronym api stands for application programming interfaces but the notion of what api means has evolved significantly 
apis today are quite different from the application programming interfaces of old read this book and see what that change entails 
about this book 
modern business ecosystems need to rethink their approach to innovation and integration this book is your guide to applying the power of apis to business challenges ranging from changing business 
models to embracing a world of devices and sensors experiencing the power of apis involves much more than simply data monetization whether you’re an api provider or an api consumer you need to make 
smart business and it decisions this book first defines the basic nature of modern apis and then leads you through several necessary decisions ranging from which apis to provide or consume to how 
you can build an effective api technology platform 
a handful of important mottos are also touched on multiple times throughout the book these include the following 
 think of an api as a product it represents something you have chosen to share with a particular audience under defined terms and conditions 
 try early learn fast scale easily an experimenting approach to apis is effective for most use cases and many apis will be opportunistic in nature 
 always use apis as the boundary of your domain that gives you control and visibility of traffic going in and out 
 api platforms are specialized for the task you want the creation operation and sharing of apis to be dead easy and 100 percent secure 
 monetizing public apis is not the only entry point 
many enterprises use apis for collaboration and innova
tion across their it and business ecosystems 
icons used in this book 
like all for dummies books this one has a few icons in the margins here’s what they mean 
the tip icon points out helpful information 

anything marked with the remember icon is good to keep in mind 
if you’re not interested in the nitty gritty technical details you can skip anything that has a technical stuff icon 
take care when you see the warning icon which alerts you to things that could harm your business

the anatomy of an api 

in this chapter 
 
knowing what an api isn’t 
 
seeing how developers and consumers want to use apis 

categorizing apis 

making apis part of the business model 

modern apis are flexible ways of projecting your capabilities to an audience outside of your own team when done right apis enable enterprises to innovate faster and reach new audiences that is the 
value of apis but what is their basic nature and what key questions should you ask when embarking on an api journey this chapter attempts to answer those questions 
looking at what an api is not 
sometimes the best way to explain something is to explain what it’s not with that in mind here are a few things that apis aren’t 
 a piece of software software isn’t an api but it may render itself as an api to ease consumption of its capabilities 
 a user interface a user interface isn’t an api but it may be built on top of one 
 a server a server isn’t an api but it may host one or more apis that expose the data and functions provided by the server 
the product nature of apis 
think of an api as a product you carefully craft it so it’s attractive to the intended consumer   so that it sells it neither matters whether that consumer really pays for the api nor if she’s 
outside your enterprise or part of a different team inside it you want her to use your api because she creates value for both of you when she does 
the product nature of apis is fundamental to their power it also makes them very different from old school application programming interfaces an old school application programming interface 
represents a piece of software that you have built and deployed a modern api represents a package of capabilities that’s attractive to an audience independent of any specific piece of software 
running in your back end so although modern apis do include a defined programmatic interface they’re deliberately designed from the perspective of the intended consumer 

because an api is a product before you develop one you should ask yourself these key questions 
 who are the intended consumers 
 how are you going to reach these consumers 
 under what terms and conditions can consumers use

this api 
from apis to api economy 
the api economy emerges when apis become part of the business model public and partner apis have been strategic enablers for several business models such as twitter’s and amazon’s 
the twitter apis for example easily have ten times more traffic than the twitter website does the company’s business model deliberately focuses on tweet mediation letting anyone who wants to do so 
provide the end user experience 
 chapter 1 the anatomy of an api 7 
from the get go amazon chose to be not just an internet retailer but also a ubiquitous merchant portal amazon’s merchant platform is deliberately built on apis that allow easy onboarding of new 
merchants 
apis as business network enablers aren’t new banks have built payment infrastructures and clearinghouses based on well defined apis for decades modern apis however are built explicitly for an open 
ecosystem internal or external not for closed private networks furthermore the consumption models for apis are standardized with a focus on ease of consumption rather than ease of creation see 
understanding what developers want later in this chapter 
some people use the term business apis for all modern apis the term is certainly fitting in the sense that apis as products should be an integral part of your business strategy just be aware that 
launching a public or partner api isn’t the only way to make apis part of your business model there are many use cases for internally consumed apis perhaps the most common such use case being the 
need to provide a differentiating omnichannel customer experience 

whether your business was born on the web or has been around for 100 years you’re living in the age of cloud analytics mobile and social computing where omnichannel has become table stakes to 
differentiate yourself from your competitors you have to give customers an immediately engaging experience to deliver that experience you need freedom to experiment and innovate seize the 
opportunity and try early learn fast and scale easily 
understanding what 
developers want 

developers want to use apis for innovation and experimentation to them reuse is about speeding time to delivery sharing is about expediency and encapsulation is about having little to learn they’re 
not as interested in how apis were created and at what cost as they are in how easy the apis are to consume

easy consumption doesn’t refer only to what the api looks like to the developer who is api savvy easy consumption also means that an api must be easy to find and easy to register to use and it must 
be clear how much the api can be trusted in mission critical solutions 
ideally an api ecosystem should be community centric an effective api community shows developers the exact apis available to them for their current tasks self service registration and preapprovals 
are already in place for the apis that are visible to the community the community’s social features allow people to like or dislike a particular api and consumer centric analytics show the expected 
operational behavior of any api of interest these capabilities historically aren’t part of it governance but they’re core features of good api management solutions good api management solutions also 
add value for api providers making it easier to create apis and improving control of their runtime behavior explained in more detail in chapter 2

managing apis   and not 

in this chapter 
 
reviewing api management roles and tasks 
 
establishing api governance 
f/p code disconnect  2.1.  3.  4.  4.1.  4.2.  4.3.  4.4.  5. 
seeing when to use unmanaged apis 

part and parcel of many api conversations is the notion of api management even though apis aren’t pieces of software in the traditional sense see chapter 1 they’re important elements of both 
business and it operating environments so they need to be managed appropriately in this chapter you find out how 
seeing what it means to manage an api 
to an api consumer a great developer portal is everything to an api provider managing the api externalization and sharing processes is only the tip of the iceberg see figure 2 1 under the waterline 
are the business and it concerns that make apis practical to create deploy and operate these concerns include data mapping security rate throttling monitoring and version management 
a managed api not only has a well defined interface and a defined target audience but also is under appropriately enforced business and it controls different groups have specific parts to play in 
api management as you see in this section 

for maximum effectiveness all three roles addressed in this chapter   business owner it operations and api designer   need their own user experience designs their concerns are sufficiently different 
that one role’s tools are inefficient for another role 
api business owner 
the api business owner decides the following 
 the plans terms and conditions under which the api can be consumed 
 the communities that the api will be shared with 
 whether the api is succeeding in its objectives if not the business model needs adjustment 
all this can be done without changing the api definition or implementation in any way for more about the business owner’s role see the need for api governance later in this chapter

 chapter 2 managing apis   and not 13 
it operations 
it operations must ensure certain operational characteristics all of which can also be done without changing the api definition or implementation in any way these characteristics are as follows 
 the runtime that hosts the api can be operated securely and robustly 
 the api is properly authenticated and authorization is in place for anyone who uses it 
 api traffic is optimized and prioritized according to business needs 

there’s a fundamental difference between what the api owner sells in terms of api plan access and what the underlying it infrastructure can provide having spare capacity to support the full 
potential of traffic corresponding to api plans sold can be very costly 
to prevent prohibitive runtime costs make sure that your api runtime is highly scalable so that actual loads matter less or apply traffic throttling when current load surpasses available capacity 
to smooth out traffic spikes these capabilities should be available in your selected api runtime 
for more about it operations’ role see the need for api governance later in this chapter 
api designer 
the person that holds the api designer role physically creates and deploys the api she needs to do the following 
 define the api interface 
 discover back end endpoints that may provide the data or function required to implement the api 
 configure the mapping between the api interface and the back end data or function sources 
the api designer must be able to perform these tasks without doing a lot of coding as soon as creating an api becomes code intensive rather than a matter of dynamic configuration the rate of 
innovation inevitably slows even for the most agile development teams the distinction between configuring an api and developing the back end data or function embodying that api is fundamental to 
api thinking as pointed out in chapter 1 modern apis aren’t a piece of software modern apis are a flexible way of projecting capabilities to audiences outside your own team 
the need for api governance 
a common myth in api circles is that governance bogs everything down but governance is about making good decisions  making sure that the right people make the right decisions at the right time and 
for the right reasons based on the right information so if an api is important to your organization you want to make good decisions about it as an api provider or an api consumer you have several 
decisions to make about apis 

this governance is a different kind of governance from the type that’s routinely applied as part of a software delivery life cycle nevertheless it’s important 
api provider decisions 
deciding who can use the api under which business terms and conditions is the job of the api business owner this business operational decision applies to all apis whether they’re the apis that your 
mobile development team uses to build mobile apps the apis that you use to integrate systems across various lines of business or the apis used by external consumers so you probably want to make 
different decisions for each of these audiences in terms of what apis they may use under which conditions 
it operations also needs to make appropriate api provider decisions   typically in the form of security and traffic policies  to protect the infrastructure from misuse or overload 
the governance regime needs to be very lightweight and the decisions must be operational in nature as opposed to the typical life cycle decisions made during a software delivery life cycle if the 
right decisions can’t be made and enforced easily the open and dynamic nature of apis is compromised 
 chapter 2 managing apis   and not 15 
 remember good api implementations are configurations not code business and it decisions are both part of good api management discipline and should be supported by the chosen api platform for more 
about api middleware see chapter 5 
api consumer decisions 
api consumers also need to make good decisions in particular they need to decide which apis they’re willing to use for what purposes and then ask the following questions about each api 
 what is the payment model for using the api and is that acceptable for your purpose 
 will you need a corporate proxy in front of the api to handle licenses payment and the like or will every developer register independently 
 is the api secure and reliable for mission critical purposes any historical records about how the api has behaved over time may add to consumer confidence in using it 
when the apis being consumed are your own these decisions are pretty straightforward being mainly about overall business design when the apis are third party apis the decisions become more 
complicated ultimately the end user experience and responsibility for maintaining business integrity can’t be delegated you need someone in your own organization to be responsible for the end user 
experience and to make the right decisions about which apis it’s appropriate to consume as part of your delivery model 
making the case for 
unmanaged apis 

everyone knows that modern apis must be powered by an api management solution right not so fast not all apis are necessarily managed throughout this chapter i’ve defined good api management but 
what does it mean for an api to be unmanaged 
here are the key differences between managed and unmanaged apis 
these materials are © 2015 john wiley & sons inc any dissemination distribution or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited 
 an unmanaged api may have an intended target audience but this target audience is rarely precisely defined let alone enforced if a user has network access to the api generally he can invoke it 
 an unmanaged api doesn’t have independently enforced business and it controls any control is provided via logic in the api implementation usually in the form of code 
in other words unmanaged apis still have a well defined interface but there’s no way to enforce controls on their runtime behavior or even on who may use them so why would you want any api to be 
unmanaged 
if an api is a direct part of your business model you probably don’t want it to be unmanaged having said that i give you a few examples of situations in which having unmanaged apis is appropriate 
or even unavoidable 
 a device or sensor has a defined api as part of its physical reality such as a home thermostat that can be programmed remotely or a fitbit a wearable device that monitors physical activity that 
synchronizes data with a computer via a defined interface 
 an existing software system   perhaps a standard system such as sap or a mainframe system with a native rest interface   exposes a micro api 
 the api sits inside your own domain and all you really need is connectivity to access it 
unmanaged apis can be important resources in many ecosystems making key functions and data available in a uniform fashion the uniform consumption model is the reason why you still want to think of 
these interfaces as apis often you even want to catalog all the unmanaged apis that are available to you to make them easy to find and as simple as possible to use in a particular programming model 
turning everything into an api as seen from the consumer is the easiest and most effective way of innovating and collaborating in a hybrid environment this means that thinking apis isn’t just about 
api management and managed apis thinking apis should be part of a bigger integration strategy for turning your enterprise into an innovation engine

chapter 3 

discovering the nature 
of good apis 

in this chapter 
 
seeing why apis are like race cars 
 
using opportunistic apis 
 
combining apis with service oriented architecture 
yea 
understanding good api design 

rapid innovation is enabled by good design   which for any given api includes its interface and technical characteristics more important good design is about which apis to provide and when if all 
you are trying to do is provide a handful of stable public apis perhaps the question of which ones is not so complicated but what if you are trying to do that as well as create a partner ecosystem 
as well as use apis to fuel internal innovation there are many different kinds of apis and uses for them so in this chapter you learn what makes a good api 
comparing apis with race cars 

you could make an apt analogy between apis and how formula 1 racing teams build and evolve race cars see figure 3 1 in formula 1 racing every single car ever raced is a prototype no team takes the 
same car to two consecutive races a race car is built from rapidly replaceable components with well defined interfaces and the car itself is instrumented with built in controls and analytics 
although parts of the car may remain stable throughout the season some component is always optimized based on lessons learned in the previous race

modern enterprises are in many ways like formula 1 teams always trying to optimize the business model and always looking for the right balance between change and stability apis are one way in which 
experimentation can be harnessed for enterprise advantage try early learn fast and scale easily is a good principle to apply to the world of apis 
making the case for 
opportunistic apis 

should apis always be designed to be reusable reusability implies stability over a relatively long period and stability is appropriate if an api is to be used for partner integration or exposed 
externally as part of your business model but if the api is created simply to improve collaboration between say a mobile development team and the team that maintains a back end system of record 
reusability may be neither desirable nor appropriate 
an api needs to be attractive to use and for a developer it must be faster and more expedient to use that api than to code a different solution if the needs of a mobile developer change rapidly the 
apis must change just as fast to keep up

 chapter 3 discovering the nature of good apis 19 

this situation makes the case for opportunistic apis   rapidly created rapidly changing apis defined to meet a specific consumer need for more information about the developer point of view see 
chapter 1 

nothing in the concept of an api requires it to necessarily be reusable or stable over time the importance of reusability and stability depends solely on your business purpose for having the api if 
that business purpose involves rapid change opportunistic apis are appropriate 
providing opportunistic apis requires that creating and maintaining apis is both easy and cheap otherwise the cost of opportunistic change becomes impractically high so api management software 
focuses on this challenge 
good api management solutions create apis via configuration rather than coding and the task of creating or changing an api usually takes only minutes the nature of an easily managed api is simply 
that it is both defined and controlled by configuration regardless of the cost of creation and maintenance there’s significant value in managing even opportunistic apis properly see chapter 2 yea 
managing opportunistic apis provides the following benefits 
 definition and enforcement of business and it controls 
 global insight into how an api performs from a business perspective 
 it operational flexibility for moving and dynamically scaling api workloads 
these benefits are important aspects of try early learn fast and scale easily and are critical for optimizing change in a world of opportunities and innovation 
thinking of apis and services 
service oriented architecture soa has been mainstream for about a decade modern apis are more recent both approaches to integration have their proponents and address business and it concerns alike yea 
what’s the real difference between these approaches and do you need to choose between them 
apis versus services 
the core concept of soa is the notion of a service the open group for example defines a service as a logical representation of a repeatable activity that has a specified outcome services are self 
contained and opaque to their consumers and they have well defined interaction contracts from a technical perspective these characteristics also apply to any well designed api so technically an api 
is also a service 
in that case are apis just another name for services well there’s one important difference between services and apis however and that’s the goal behind their design see figure 3 2 apis are always 
designed to be attractive to the intended consumer and they change as the needs of the consumer change services in contrast are generally designed with global cost and stability as the most 
important concerns in the car analogy the api is the race car designed for looks and consumption but the service is the regular car designed for cost and mass production 

chapter 1 describes the product nature of apis and states that they should be aimed at the needs of a particular group of consumers to a consumer using an api is about speed expediency and having 
little to learn those design criteria 
 chapter 3 discovering the nature of good apis 21 
are the fundamental differences between apis and the classical notion of services at least different from the perspective of the service provider 
 to a service provider reuse is about effort involved in api delivery to api consumers reuse is about speed of delivery of their software no matter the cost to provide the apis consumed as part of that sofware 
 to a service provider sharing is about effectiveness to an api consumer sharing is about expediency if it isn’t expedient the api will not be used 
 to a service provider encapsulation is about having little to change to an api consumer encapsulation is about having little to learn if the interface is complex the api will not be used 
how often have you not seen an soa initiative slowed down by conflicts between service providers and service consumers on what constitutes a good service interface on the one side a mobile 
developer just wants it to be simple for her particular app on the other side the back end team wants everyone to use the same standardized service and data model instead of forcing a resolution of 
this conflict is there a way to meet both needs without incurring prohibitive cost 
a historical analogy exists in the evolution of databases the first generations of databases were focused exclusively on the internals the tables schemas and data procedures quickly though it 
became obvious that there was a need to expose controlled subsets of data in a particular form fitted to a particular group of data consumers   and the notion of a data view emerged as a core 
capability in most modern databases a lightweight proxy on top of the data domain represented by the internals of the database 
apis are controlled proxy views of the data and capabilities of a domain optimized for the needs of api consumers as long as it’s dirt cheap to create and maintain proxy apis you can use them to 
render a domain in multiple forms optimized for each group of api consumers after all you probably want to give external partners a different view of your capabilities from the view your internal 
developers have 

apis teaming with services 
soa emerged as a means of shielding service consumers from changes in the back end but who protects the service providers from the churn of changing needs in omnichannel front end solutions 
applying apis and services together lets you create an eye of calm in a hurricane of change services are the means by which providers codify the base capabilities of their domains apis are the way 
in which those capabilities services are repackaged productized and shared in an easyto use form apis and services are complementary rather than contradictory and applied together they dramatically 
increase the overall effectiveness of enterprise innovation 
recognizing good api design 
no doubt the technical design of apis is important but it also varies widely with the technology choices made for the design and implementation of any particular api for instance what constitutes a 
well designed rest interface is very different from what constitutes a well designed soap interface entire books have been written about interface design providing a level of detail way beyond what 
this small book can offer suffice it to say that interface design of apis is generally well understood as witnessed by these examples 

 rest interfaces are resource based the most important aspect of the interface design is the uri structure that allows a consumer to navigate the object graph embodied by the api 
 soap interfaces are method based the most important aspects of the interface design are the set of supported methods and the data structures of each method 
 mqtt interfaces are event based the most important aspects of the interface design are the set of events emitted or received and the associated event messages 
not all apis are rest generally rest interfaces are excellent for human consumption and they are the current preference of mobile developers but rest interfaces tend to be chatty and though they’re 
extendable they don’t carry strongly 
 chapter 3 discovering the nature of good apis 23 
typed complex data structures soap interfaces are great for system to system integration and it operations teams prefer them due to their less chatty nature and more precise data structures mqtt 
interfaces are preferred for communicating with the internet of things in which bandwidth and battery life are key concerns and guaranteed delivery may be the difference between preventing 
accidents and inadvertently letting them happen

api entry points 
in this chapter 
monetizing your data 
taking advantage of innovation 
speeding the transition to mobile 
going hybrid 
programming everything 
what does it really mean to think apis some people simply point to the so called api value chain see chapter 3 but is that all there is to it is that what the excitement is all about i believe that 
there is more to understanding apis as discussed in chapter 2 decisions have to be made regarding the balance between enterprise and opportunistic apis there are decisions around the terms and 
conditions under which apis can be shared and there are decisions regarding how to map required apis to existing assets during api implementation all of these decisions and more depend on the 
desired business outcome 
the key part of the phrase think apis is the first word think think about what you’re trying to achieve business wise which audience to engage what kinds of apis are required to engage the audience 
and how to curate your data and application assets as services to support those apis that you need to provide in the process don’t forget to think about what apis you’re going to consume yourself 
and from whom thinking apis is not just about being an api provider many organizations consume several times the number of apis that they provide these concerns are the core elements of an 
effective api strategy 
this chapter defines five api entry points that in my experience are representative for the business and it agendas driving api thinking an enterprise may have multiple agendas at the same time but 
each agenda leads to different decision criteria for api adoption you can read the chapter from beginning to end or you can jump to the entry point that best matches your business needs 
monetize your data 
monetizing your data is based on externalizing insights or functions in a form that entices third parties to use those insights or functions monetization can come in many forms the most obvious 
example is when the third party is paying to use your api in other cases you may actually be the one paying the api consumer in return for a broader business reach and a stronger ecosystem or you 
may be onboarding partners via apis without any direct payment involved at all the key business objectives for monetization are pivoting your business changing your value chain and increasing your 
reach and influence 
success with this entry point likely requires careful planning although you can and should do some experimentation opportunistic style the final product must be a set of stable enterprise apis that 
a third party can depend on for a prolonged period 
thinking about apis in the context of monetizing your data here is some guidance 
 goal the desired outcome is monetary or based on a nonmonetary value such as increasing your influence 
 audience the audience is inevitably a third party typical cases are partners and external developers not developers in your own organization or developers hired by your own organization treating a 
different line of business within your enterprise as a partner or third party isn’t uncommon particularly when the different lines of business are treated as economically independent entities 
 apis to provide the apis required to engage the audience must provide the value you want to sell this choice 
 chapter 4 api entry points 27 
requires careful thought   not just in terms of the root value provided but also in terms of the form that makes consumption attractive 
 api terms and conditions don’t forget to include in your considerations the terms and conditions under which api consumption may happen such as freemium pay as you go or prepaid contract 
 api implementation the way you curate the data and function to implement the apis comes down to quality and reliability some people say that cost of implementation is the most important factor but 
implementation cost won’t make or break a data monetizing strategy what decides long term viability is whether the intended api consumers experience both value and trustworthiness 
 consuming somebody else’s apis in some cases you also need to consider which apis to consume although you generate value primarily by providing apis for others to consume implementing those apis 
may involve creating higher level composites of existing apis most often by blending those existing apis with something that’s uniquely yours 
the data monetizing entry point may be the one you’ve heard the most about but it’s not the most common one currently a significant majority of api initiatives are for internal use cases and this 
may remain the case even when public api exchanges become fully mature 
freedom to innovate 
freedom to innovate is the most important imperative for many businesses today try early learn fast scale easily   key characteristics of a dynamic engaging enterprise the focus of this api entry 
point is to chase business opportunities aggressively and to make innovation a learning process through the following model 
 everything is a prototype until it’s proved in practice 
 discovering that something didn’t work isn’t failure it’s just learning 
 standing still guarantees decline

as discussed in chapter 3 the role of apis is to provide the calm center in a storm of change this role has two aspects 
 delivering quickly what the experimenting api consumer needs and removing it when it’s no longer needed 
 protecting the provider from churn see chapter 3 for a refresher on why defining and deploying new api views on existing assets should be easy and cheap 

the freedom to innovate entry point is perhaps not as glamorous as monetize your data see the preceding section but it’s by far the api use case that ibm sees the most in major enterprises the 
ability to compose new innovative capabilities internal and or external without breaking the bank in terms of cost is something that everyone is struggling with to accelerate innovation a blend of 
careful planning and opportunistic reaction is required 
thinking about apis in the context of freedom to innovate here is some guidance 
 goal the desired outcome is to quickly discover what works and what differentiates in the market and then to scale successes 
even when you believe that you know what the market needs a learning attitude can deliver a healthy reality check it’s easy to get symptom and cause mixed up when you’re dealing with complex market 
dynamics 
 audience the audience is primarily internal developers in house or outsourced sometimes external agencies are hired to be part of an innovation effort in these cases more formal agreements about 
which apis to provide and when are required but even then it’s best to maintain some opportunistic behavior to maintain learning speed contract negotiations are anathema to fast innovation 
 apis to provide the apis required to engage the audience are a blend of predefined enterprise apis and opportunistic apis see chapter 3 derived from the needs of an innovative app mixing in some 
enterprise apis to expose core data in an easily accessible fashion can kick start not only development but also idea generation

 chapter 4 api entry points 29 

keep the predefined apis small and simple exposing the full data structure of a customer back end system probably wouldn’t be easy for an innovative channel developer to consume 
 api terms and conditions the terms and conditions under which api consumption happen remain important not in terms of payment but in terms of protecting the security and stability of back end 
systems after all innovation is unpredictable 
 api implementation the way you curate the data and functions required to implement the apis is different for preplanned enterprise apis and opportunistic demand driven apis 
for preplanned apis you must make careful decisions about which data segments to expose at an organizational level also your implementation typically proxy’ing enterprise services needs to take 
ultimate runtime cost into account preplanned apis will be used in unpredictable ways so runtime cost must not be a preventing factor for such use 

for opportunistic apis the most important considerations are development speed and development cost if you have to do a hack to get the api out the door today rather than next week do so as long as 
you have a viable plan for cleaning up the api implementation if and when that api becomes a success 

many opportunistic apis may not live very long if it turns out that you need something different just scratch the opportunistic api and start over in the next iteration of the learning process 
 consuming somebody else’s apis considering which third party apis to consume is important for this entry point as a simple example building social mobile apps is difficult without accessing apis 
from well known public social services such as twitter facebook and linkedin these third party apis should be part of the api catalog that you provide your internal developers they shouldn’t have 
to go to some external site to find things themselves you may even want to curate the third party apis into your own simpler version as some of the public apis are quite complex in their native 
forms

innovation is never easy but it can be aided in various ways proper use of apis can make the corporate back end an integral part of your innovation engine rather than a millstone around your neck 
enterprises with a long history have the advantage of having more assets to expose as apis but even for startups an api driven approach to implementing innovative solutions provides more 
flexibility in terms of sourcing data and function the use of apis frees channel developers to focus on the user experience rather than integration the use of apis also promotes an omnichannel 
experience as the data and functions behind the api by definition are remote and can be accessed from any channel or application across the enterprise

this api entry point is strongly related to the freedom toinnovate entry point see the preceding section and can be considered to be an extreme variant the difference is that for this entry point 
everything is about opportunistically supporting what your mobile development team needs here and now 
enterprises today need to create many small self contained apps rather than traditional comprehensive portals i strongly believe that mobile consumers prefer to orchestrate their own omnichannel 
experiences instead of having someone else predefine the process i see it in my own behavior where i rarely spend more than a couple of minutes in a given mobile app before moving on to something 
else 
the mobile in ten minutes entry point involves improving collaboration between back end owners and mobile development teams those mobile development teams can be internal or external but in all 
cases they need to leverage existing data and functions easily to provide an engaging experience being able to see stock prices is useful for example but being able to do something with them in the 
context of your own investment portfolio is the true differentiator 
the focus of this entry point is controlled simplicity hide complexity simplify what the mobile developer sees and consumes and at the same time provide appropriate business and it operational 
control also the process has to be fast in order to not slow down mobile innovation

 chapter 4 api entry points 31 

just for the fun of it some ibm developers tested whether it was possible to take a piece of data on a mainframe and put it on a mobile device using an api approach in 10 to 15 minutes it was 
indeed possible there wasn’t any pretty api design but it proved that the complexity of integration logic can largely be taken out of the equation by appropriate use of api and integration 
technology 
mobile in ten minutes is all about opportunistic innovation thinking about apis in that context here is some guidance 
 goal the desired outcome is immediate support for the needs of your mobile development teams the mobile team is responsible for figuring out what data the end user experience requires and the back 
end owner builds the apis that deliver exactly that data mapping to existing data and functions services is part of the api implementation not the responsibility of the mobile developer 
 audience the audience for the apis is your mobile development team period 
 apis to provide the apis required to engage the audience are almost exclusively opportunistic you may be lucky enough to be able to apply existing apis to a new mobile app but you want to avoid 
creating too many cross app dependencies on particular api contracts 
 api terms and conditions the terms and conditions under which api consumption happen are about protecting the security and stability of back end systems the same is true for freedom to innovate 
see the preceding section 
 api implementation as the apis produced are very opportunistic and rarely live long the most important considerations are development speed and development cost if you have to do a hack to get the 
api out the door today rather than next week do so as long as you have a viable plan for cleaning up the api implementation if and when that api becomes a success 
 consuming somebody else’s apis engaging mobile applications typically need a social element so it’s crucial to consider which public social apis such as twitter facebook and linkedin to consume 
and how to control that consumption you may want to curate the third party social apis into your own simpler version refer to freedom to innovate earlier in this chapter at minimum you must 
consider the dark side of apis see chapter 6 and try to minimize the impact on your business reputation if any stability or ethical issues arise from the public apis that you end up using 
the opportunistic approach of this api entry point may sound unmanageable due to the number of apis involved and their inevitably limited reuse   and indeed with the technology available even three 
to four years ago it would have been practically unfeasible for many large enterprises not so today api management software changes the equation with its ability to easily delineate a lightweight 
consumer centric api from the portfolio of software based enterprise data and services if it’s dead easy to create a new api and if it’s simple to manage and share large numbers of apis with 
various communities reuse and architectural rigor on the api interfaces are much less of a concern instead the main concern is what will make the api consumer successful 
living in a hybrid world 
no book about apis would be complete without discussing how apis relate to cloud the fourth api entry point focuses on using apis as the uniform consumption model in a hybrid ecosystem of on 
premise systems and private and public cloud environments the business mantra is freedom of choice    freedom to choose how to source any function or data and freedom to deploy solutions to any 
desired form factor 
an api centric approach to integration is driven by the following 
 a disconnected enterprise isn’t competitive so cloud equals hybrid solutions across cloud parts and on premise parts and integration needs to be managed at scale 
 cloud is about capability business and it not location so any ubiquitous consumption model needs to be location independent 
 in a system of systems world there’s no traditional network perimeter to enforce so interactions need to be controlled at the application level 
 chapter 4 api entry points 33 
if to a consumer everything is a remote able api then the consumer doesn’t need to know anything about where and how that api is hosted syndicated api catalogs can and should provide visibility 
across domain and provider boundaries in this api entry point one of the most important aids for a developer is the catalog of apis that are readily available for consumption don’t show every 
single api out there there are too many show only the ones that are relevant to the developer in question that developer shouldn’t have to care about how and why the api is procured she should 
focus solely on what she can do with the api after it has been made available to her 
in a hybrid world the domain structure is inevitably complex public marketplaces private api catalogs partner portals and more are part of the api fabric consequently a well defined community 
structure is more important than ever with direct correlation between community design decisions and api design decisions 
figure 4 1 illustrates how a developer can use apis to securely access any part of a hybrid environment at development time the api marketplace provides information about the apis that are 
available to the community of that developer at runtime the cloud gateways secure the communication between the api consumer environment and any api endpoint independently of location 

thinking about apis in the context of living in a hybrid world here is some guidance 
 goal the desired outcome is to empower both developers and it operations careful controls need to be placed on the apis made available and any communication on an open network needs to be secure 
and appropriately managed 

the most often cited reason for not adopting a hybrid cloud approach is security concerns the second mostoften cited reason is fear of losing operational control 
 audience the audience can be any mix of internal and external developers who are part of the hybrid ecosystem so designing appropriate community structures is very important making decisions at 
the single person level is highly impractical you need a structure that allows you to make and enforce api sharing decisions at the community level treating all developers in a particular community 
in the same fashion 
 apis to provide the apis you need to engage the audience depend on the audience community structure for external audiences you probably need a good set of predefined enterprise apis for internal 
audiences you need some opportunistic apis to support rapid creation of innovative apps no hard and fast rule applies to all hybrid cases each hybrid case tends to be different 
 api terms and conditions the terms and conditions under which api consumption happens can be complicated in a hybrid world   business wise as well as it wise this holds true whether the apis are 
managed or unmanaged see chapter 2 yet the implementation mechanisms usually are very different for the two 

for managed apis you apply business and it policies in the normal fashion on the api platform  this is one of the advantages of using apis as the uniform consumption model just make sure that your 
api platform is community aware so that you can make decisions at the appropriate community level 

for unmanaged apis the only vehicle for enforcing business terms and conditions is community visibility along with any formal agreements that you establish through side channels where unmanaged apis

 chapter 4 api entry points 35 
are concerned it operations has no built in way of enforcing api level security and traffic controls unmanaged apis must instead be invoked through secure tunnels established at the network level 
 api implementation the way that you curate the data and functions to implement the apis differs for preplanned enterprise apis and opportunistic demand driven apis as described in freedom to innovate 
earlier in this chapter the key differences are robustness and runtime cost versus time and development cost 
 consuming somebody else’s apis considering which third party apis to consume is harder for this entry point than for any of the other entry points because over time the number and variety of available 
apis is dramatically greater 

the best advice is to start simple on api consumption pick a small number of important apis that you want to consume social apis analytical apis mobile back end apis or something else depending on your 
most immediate business need you also have the option of curating third party apis into your own simpler or more controlled version so take that option into account in your decision making 
hybrid environments are intrinsically complex using apis as the lingua franca can make that complexity much more manageable from a developer perspective from an it operational perspective complexity may 
become manageable due to the evolution in hybrid cloud platforms 
program your world 
the final api entry point focuses on the world of devices and machinery it’s based on two beliefs the consumer driven mobile revolution is about more than just phones and manufacturing and logistics 
will drive the intelligent corporate internet of things 
healthcare utilities cities manufacturing   practically everywhere you turn you see the need for a more intelligent approach to blending people software and machines granted the idea of programming 
everything into a single intelligent experience is still emerging but signs of progress 
these materials are © 2015 john wiley & sons inc any dissemination distribution or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited 

toward that goal are seen every day in such examples as smart cars interactive retail experiences and ecofriendly buildings 
one important difference separates this entry point from the others you generally can’t change a device after it exists in its physical form that fact in turn means that the device apis remain what they 
are therefore the focus shifts to providing an enriched experience with optimized execution as follows 
 extend software into the physical realm 
 control any component software or device through programmable apis 
 use device driven feedback and insight to optimize 
the behavior of the entire system not just a single component 

 where appropriate monetize your high level control capabilities as your own set of apis refer to monetize your data earlier in this chapter 
the programming the world entry point usually is much more about api consumption than it is about providing new apis 
thinking about apis in the context of programming the world around you here is some guidance 
 goal the desired outcome is a completely programmable environment look for a programmable physical infrastructure and build your own software to be controllable through apis as well 
 audience the audience is mostly internal your own developers are the ones who’ll be building smart systems on top of device and software apis if you’re a producer of devices yourself you do need to make 
sure that your own devices have apis intended for consumption by others as required by your business model 
 apis to provide the apis you need to engage the audience are largely defined by whatever interfaces are designed into your physical devices and machinery you don’t have a whole lot of choice as the 
majority of the apis you’ll be using are predefined 
 api terms and conditions if you have network access to a device you can most likely communicate with it 
 chapter 4 api entry points 37 

because its apis are by definition unmanaged terms and conditions are not as important for this entry point as they are for the others much more important is having a good library of available device 
apis 
in some cases you do want to control access to the device level apis and can do so by adding in front of the device apis a layer of managed proxy apis with built in security controls 
 api implementation for device apis the methods used to curate the data and functions to implement the apis aren’t your concern unless of course you are a producer of physical devices 
 consuming somebody else’s apis considering which third party apis to consume is very important for this api entry point having the right agreements in place with third party suppliers of devices and 
machinery is critical if you don’t have updated api documentation you simply can’t communicate effectively with the device 
as the world gets smarter and more instrumented the need for program your world capabilities will continue to rise because this environment is quite different from a classical software only environment 
getting an early start may be necessary embarking on this journey requires developers and businesspeople alike to get experience in what it means to seamlessly program interactions among devices software 
and people

chapter 5 
api and integration middleware 
in this chapter 
understanding api middleware 
choosing a domain topology 
as i discuss in earlier chapters there are key distinctions between managed and unmanaged apis a managed api has appropriately enforced business and it controls which in turn begs the question of where 
and how those controls are enforced at runtime 
enforcing the controls in code generally is a bad idea for one thing it’s notoriously unreliable depending on the code quality of every single api implementation furthermore an organization really needs 
to be able to change the controls without having to change and redeploy the api itself in other words the controls should be policy driven with independently managed policies defining the business and it 
operational intent and the api runtime enforcing that intent examples of common policies are the level of security required and the amount of traffic allowed 
a piece of middleware that hosts apis and enforces api policies is commonly called an api gateway don’t forget that api platforms aren’t just about the runtime they need development time capabilities as 
well 
api middleware isn’t 
 just another esb 

have you ever heard someone say i already have an enterprise service bus esb so i’m all set for apis the implication is that api middleware is just another esb in fact there are significant differences 
 ideally apis are defined by configuration rather than coding defining the api by configuration preserves the lightweight nature of the api proxy and supports fast turnaround for new and changed apis by 
contrast general purpose esb tools are flow or code centric and service implementations are part of the enterprise software delivery life cycle even with continuous delivery a code centric approach is 
difficult to maintain while attempting to meet the need for rapidly changing opportunistic apis see chapter 2 
 api runtimes need to be lightning fast completely secure robust and highly scalable ideally the api gateway has routerlike network characteristics so adding an api proxy as part of an end to end 
interaction never creates problems with response time or latency the fastest and most scalable api gateways are based on domain specific lightweight configuration languages with stateless execution 
although general purpose esb runtimes also need to be fast robust and scalable the execution engines must be able to support full scale composition and some amount of statefulness consequently general 
purpose esb run times can’t be as highly optimized for throughput as api runtimes 
 apis have policy driven business and it controls ranging from authentication to traffic controls and the business terms and conditions under which the api may be consumed the api plan although some 
comprehensive esbs include traffic management policies few have the security policy capabilities and certification of a full scale api gateway and none has the separate business controls embodied in an 
api plan furthermore the software nature of esb executables typically provides less room for operations to control runtime objects independently after deployment 
 chapter 5 api and integration middleware 41 

 apis must be made available to app developers in a self service fashion any kind of post deployment approval process slows the adoption rate and ultimately at scale generates significant organizational 
costs 
the preferred sharing mechanism   one that has proved to be highly effective   is publishing apis to developer portal environments in particular for internal api use sharing is preferably managed on a 
community basis making sure that given developers see only the apis that their community is supposed to use 
general purpose esbs include none of these features and even service management solutions whether embedded or separate are aimed more at service development time controls and operational controls than at 
optimizing the developer sharing process 
 finally api owners need business statistics about who uses their apis and how much these statistics measure success against the business objectives for the portfolio of apis rather than focusing on it 
concerns such as the operational dashboards typically included in esb platforms 
some people may argue that you need only one bus which can be repurposed to support classical integration needs service oriented architecture soa and also api management yet without providing dedicated 
experiences for the api developer api owner and api consumer you risk engineering the middleware for the lowest common denominator not to mention that the classical integration developers also need their 
separate optimized experience further if you need only api management or general purpose integration capabilities why pay for both 
modern enterprises need api management as well as enterprise integration but as two separate platforms aimed at different target audiences do remember though that if you are already doing soa you have a 
good set of assets that you can quickly discover assemble into proxy apis and expose through an api management platform 
the repeatable topology 
of integration 

an api gateway controls traffic across the boundary between api consumer and api implementation it also enforces the terms and conditions for api consumption defined by the api owner historically we’ve 
tended to think of different types of gateways be they web security messaging or api gateways as being distinct boxes in a deployment topology in a hybrid world of devices people and software however the 
perception of distinct gateway boxes is rapidly evaporating as the scale and variety of interaction grow by orders of magnitude it’s operationally advantageous to have a unified gateway strategy with a 
single command andcontrol center for any traffic that crosses internal or external boundaries 
as a good practice traffic across a domain boundary should always happen through an api this approach to integration creates a desirable level of visibility and control furthermore it provides maximum 
flexibility in terms of balancing enterprise and opportunistic implementations in a way that’s completely invisible to the api consumer 
the choice of a coarse grained or fine grained domain topology is up to the individual enterprise typical domain boundaries are driven by the following 
 organization such as mobile developer versus back end team 
 ownership such as line of business boundaries 
 security such as demilitarized zone [dmz] versus internal network 
 quality of service such as mainframe versus distributed 
 ecosystem such as public or partner 
it’s important that this suggested integration topology model be both repeatable and composeable for each domain within an ecosystem good practice dictates the same topology structure with cross domain 
interactions at runtime always going through a api gateway as illustrated by figure 5 1 in the figure each separate domain has the same structure of 
 chapter 5 api and integration middleware 43 
concentric circles with different types of integration capabilities the standard integration topology for each domain can be composed to a system of systems topology across multiple domains simply by 
repeating the pattern in other words the domain structure can be defined by the needs of the enterprise yet the api sharing and consumption mechanisms remain the same this structure crisply addresses the 
system of systems nature of hybrid integration environments and is a good fit for any api entry point defined in chapter 4 

some people would argue that latency or response time is an issue in a pattern that always goes through an api for cross domain interaction good api gateways make latency and response time nonissues as 
outlined in api middleware isn’t just another esb earlier in this chapter as an analogy how often do you ponder the number of routers between a browser and a web server hardly ever you just assume that 
the router infrastructure is fast enough and scalable enough that the number of routers isn’t an issue granted the actual network distance between two points can and will add some amount of latency but 
this latency is due to network distance rather than the number of network routers involved good api gateways are like routers in this respect adding one of these gateways on the path from api consumer to 
api provider makes no noticeable difference 

use general purpose esbs in the integration bus role curating data and function into well formed services then define proxy apis to control the productization of those services in the ecosystem beyond 
your own domain finally run all api traffic through a highly scalable robust and secure api gateway that way each part of the end to end integration platform is used in the area of its main strength 
refer to figure 5 1

api and service economy reference model 
back in the 2000s ibm defined an soa reference model that outlined the middleware capabilities required to create deploy and manage services effectively in the api economy those capabilities are still 
important as services are the basis on which apis can be defined but they’re no longer sufficient embracing an open ecosystem delivering apis as part of a business product and carefully promoting and 
managing your cross domain business persona require more than classical integration middleware 
the reference model for this extended middleware platform is defined in figure 5 2 it is a practical guideline for the set of middleware capabilities to seek across your integration and api platforms 
the integration centric elements of the original ibm soa reference model are rendered in compressed form as the bottom layer of the api and service economy reference model in addition the new reference 
model has capabilities for defining and managing apis for developer portals and marketplaces as well as capabilities that accelerate the consumption of apis 
 chapter 5 api and integration middleware 45 
it’s important not to make decisions about the parts of the reference model in isolation instead use an integrated middleware strategy to turn assets into business advantages

ten things to know 
about apis 

in this chapter 
 
seeing that apis are products 
recognizing that design never stops 
understanding that every api needs an owner
part of an api journey is the mental mindset that lets an organization think about apis in an effective fashion this chapter contains some of the things that i have learned on my own journey through 
the world of apis 
the omnichannel experience 
drives the need for apis 

the basic concept of apis isn’t new the difference now is that modern users consumer and enterprise expect an omnichannel experience that’s both social and personal to be truly personal the experience 
must be self orchestrated at least to some degree no longer can an enterprise define a one size fits everything channel process 
self orchestration inevitably points in the direction of micro apps which in turn lead to the need for purpose built apis an omnichannel experience implies an ecosystem that includes people software 
and devices which again leads to the need for purpose built apis

apis are business products 
thinking of apis as business products makes it easier to tell the difference between an api centric approach and a classical software delivery approach for products you have several key questions to ask 
 who is the audience 
 what do they want to buy 
 what are the terms and conditions under which i’m willing to sell 
the terms buy and sell are used deliberately even though the economic models behind apis vary widely whether the price is cash or influence whether the model is consumer paid or provider paid the 
product nature of the api persists business design is an end to end endeavor 

apis are no longer just it concerns apis should be part of your end to end business design 
consider a traveler who shares her experiences on social channels one day she tweets about a really bad experience with airline a ten minutes later she receives an email from the airline that says we’re 
sorry about your bad experience here is what we can do for you the next week she has a great travel experience with airline b and as usual she tweets about it five minutes later that airline retweets her 
tweet with this added text happy you had a good experience see you next time 
both these airlines considered in advance how to weave social channels through the use of apis into their overall business operating models 
 chapter 6 ten things to know about apis 49 
you can gain insight from api instrumentation 
try early learn fast scale easily   part of that recipe is the ability to learn fast and the best way to learn fast is to tap into information already flowing through the business operating system you 
can access this information easily via instrumentation of apis and use of associated business analytics capabilities that should be part of a fully functional api middle ware platform 
not all apis are rest 
a common myth is soap is dead apis are always rest although most modern apis are currently based on rest json rather than soap this fact doesn’t mean that there’s no use for the formalism of soap  
 merely that such formalism isn’t necessary for human consumption of apis the focus of most current api discussions there are still plenty of uses for soap in machine to machine communication and formal 
composition tools there are good reasons why the industry has invented more than one binding protocol good designers choose the right one for the purpose 
every api needs a business owner 
simply put no business api owner equals no responsibility and no decision making power it’s human nature for people to resist owning things that they don’t control completely as in only this part is my 
responsibility nevertheless you must assign a business owner to every single api that person then becomes the focal point of decisions about productization and sharing 
apis do need to be versioned 

saying that apis aren’t versioned is like saying that you don’t need to change a baby’s diaper obviously disruptive changes happen and when they do you have to handle them claiming that versioning isn’t 
necessary merely means letting the consumers of an api figure out the versioning themselves 
because apis are business products you should version them wisely reduce version churn by coining a new official version only when an update isn’t backward compatible 
apis are easy to control 
with policies 

policies are the traditional ways that business and it operations intentions get codified therefore they’re vehicles for business consistency and integrity the terms and conditions under which apis are 
consumed and managed should be codified as policies which in turn are enforced by api platforms 
it’s important to make sure that policies can be changed independently of the logic embodying the api itself such as interface and data mapping this supports dynamic change of operating behavior 
apis have a dark side 
innovation without business integrity is a fragile value proposition whether the breach of integrity is a broken promise exposure of sensitive information or inappropriate behavior the result is largely 
the same it takes only one bad experience for someone to lose faith in you 
when you use a third party api take care that your own business’s integrity won’t be negatively affected the vehicle you use   formal agreements with penalties compensation mechanisms or judicious 
evaluation of api robustness and security   matters less than the fact that you’ve taken proper precautions remember to include ethical concerns in your consideration

2.1. all pc's : check network profile and network discovery and share settings 
sometimes this selection to change between private and public network profile is missing from settings / networks page . 
in that case profile must change by powershell . right click windows icon ( start button ) and open powershell ( admin ) 
and use following commands to get interface index number and change profile to private ( or public ) : get - net connection profile 
set - net connection profile - interface index < index number > - network category private 
2.2. all pc's : check network discovery and share settings 
3. all pc's : set start type to automatic and start following services that allow pc's to be visible on network . ( reboot ) 
push win key and type " services " , locate these services . 
- function discovery provider host 
- function discovery resource publication 
- ssdp discovery 
- upnp device host 
4. setting shares . 
4.1. check your current shares . 
open file explorer and type \ localhost to address bar to see what shares are made in this computer . 
4.2. create new share ( here i use folder " test " ) . 
( setting " turn on sharing so anyone … " in step 2.2. make share for folders in c: users automatic . ) 
folder is now shared and network share path is : \ pc name test 
4.3. safe way to share folders . 
create user account to all users on your network to whom you want to give access to shared resources . 
use same user id and password which they have on their own computers . 
right click " test " and open properties and select security tab to see current settings . 
default security settings are shown in next picture . 
those settings allow access to shared folders only for those users who have user id on that computer . 
image 
4.4. sharing folder " test " to everyone " ( very unsafe setting ! think carefully do you need to select this ! ) 
if you want that everyone have access to that share then go to security tab and : 
- click edit 
- on permission dialog click add . 
- new dialog open and you can add " everyone " to that list 
- when back to permissions dialog select which rights you want to give to " everyone " . 
now anyone on your home network should have access to shared folders without credentials or having user account on your computer . 
5. now when click network on file explorer all your pc's should be visible in computer and network sections . 
this should be cover the essentials to sharing your data over local network . this share is not limited to c: users folder , every folder can be handled like shown in steps 4 . 
now your pc's should visible , but if not then try to reset all network settings : 
go to settings / network & internet / status , scroll down to find " network reset , on next window click " reset now " button . 
it will takes about 5 min to perform this reset and then pc reboot automatic . 
when you sign in first time you get notification something like " do you want your pc to be 
access by other computers " , click yes for that . 
when external forces are applied to a stationary object , stress and
strain are the result . stress is defined as the objects internal resisting
forces , and strain is defined as the displacement and deformation that
occur . for a uniform distribution of internal resisting forces , stress can
be calculated ( figure 2 - 1 ) by dividing the force ( f ) applied by the unit
area ( a ) : 
strain is defined as the amount of deformation per unit length of an
object when a load is applied . strain is calculated by dividing the total
deformation of the original length by the original length ( l ) : 
typical values for strain are less than 0 . 005 inch / inch and are often
expressed in micro - strain units : 
strain may be compressive or tensile and is typically measured by
strain gages . it was lord kelvin who first reported in 1856 that
metallic conductors subjected to mechanical strain exhibit a change in
their electrical resistance . this phenomenon was first put to practical
use in the 1930s . 
fundamentally , all strain gages are designed to convert mechanical
motion into an electronic signal . a change in capacitance , inductance , 
or resistance is proportional to the strain experienced by the sensor . 
if a wire is held under tension , it gets slightly longer and its crosssectional
area is reduced . this changes its resistance ( r ) in proportion
to the strain sensitivity ( s ) of the wires resistance . when a strain is
introduced , the strain sensitivity , which is also called the gage factor
( gf ) , is given by : 
figure 2 - 1 : definitions of stress & strain
the strain gage page 1 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain . html 11 / 5 / 2008
the ideal strain gage would change resistance only due to the
deformations of the surface to which the sensor is attached . however , 
in real applications , temperature , material properties , the adhesive
that bonds the gage to the surface , and the stability of the metal all
affect the detected resistance . because most materials do not have
the same properties in all directions , a knowledge of the axial strain
alone is insufficient for a complete analysis . poisson , bending , and
torsional strains also need to be measured . each requires a different
strain gage arrangement . 
shearing strain considers the angular distortion of an object under
stress . imagine that a horizontal force is acting on the top right
corner of a thick book on a table , forcing the book to become
somewhat trapezoidal ( figure 2 - 2 ) . the shearing strain in this case
can be expressed as the angular change in radians between the
vertical y - axis and the new position . the shearing strain is the
tangent of this angle . 
poisson strain expresses both the thinning and elongation that
occurs in a strained bar ( figure 2 - 3 ) . poisson strain is defined as the
negative ratio of the strain in the traverse direction ( caused by the
contraction of the bars diameter ) to the strain in the longitudinal
direction . as the length increases and the cross sectional area
decreases , the electrical resistance of the wire also rises . 
bending strain , or moment strain , is calculated by determining the
relationship between the force and the amount of bending which
results from it . although not as commonly detected as the other types

of strain , torsional strain is measured when the strain produced by
twisting is of interest . torsional strain is calculated by dividing the
torsional stress by the torsional modulus of elasticity . 
sensor designs
the deformation of an object can be measured by mechanical , optical , 
acoustical , pneumatic , and electrical means . the earliest strain gages
were mechanical devices that measured strain by measuring the
change in length and comparing it to the original length of the object . 
for example , the extension meter ( extensiometer ) uses a series of
levers to amplify strain to a readable value . in general , however , 
mechanical devices tend to provide low resolutions , and are bulky and
difficult to use . 
optical sensors are sensitive and accurate , but are delicate and not
very popular in industrial applications . they use interference fringes
produced by optical flats to measure strain . optical sensors operate
best under laboratory conditions . 
the most widely used characteristic that varies in proportion to
strain is electrical resistance . although capacitance and inductancebased
strain gages have been constructed , these devices sensitivity
to vibration , their mounting requirements , and circuit complexity have
limited their application . the photoelectric gage uses a light beam , 
two fine gratings , and a photocell detector to generate an electrical
current that is proportional to strain . the gage length of these devices
can be as short as 1 / 16 inch , but they are costly and delicate . 
the first bonded , metallic wire - type strain gage was developed in
1938 . the metallic foil - type strain gage consists of a grid of wire
filament ( a resistor ) of approximately 0 . 001 in . ( 0 . 025 mm ) 
thickness , bonded directly to the strained surface by a thin layer of
epoxy resin ( figure 2 - 4a ) . when a load is applied to the surface , the
resulting change in surface length is communicated to the resistor and
the corresponding strain is measured in terms of the electrical
resistance of the foil wire , which varies linearly with strain . the foil
diaphragm and the adhesive bonding agent must work together in
transmitting the strain , while the adhesive must also serve as an
figure 2 - 4 : strain gage designs
the strain gage page 3 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain . html 11 / 5 / 2008
electrical insulator between the foil grid and the surface . 
when selecting a strain gage , one must consider not only the strain
characteristics of the sensor , but also its stability and temperature
sensitivity . unfortunately , the most desirable strain gage materials
are also sensitive to temperature variations and tend to change
resistance as they age . for tests of short duration , this may not be a
serious concern , but for continuous industrial measurement , one must
include temperature and drift compensation . 
each strain gage wire material has its characteristic gage factor , 
resistance , temperature coefficient of gage factor , thermal coefficient
of resistivity , and stability . typical materials include constantan
( copper - nickel alloy ) , nichrome v ( nickel - chrome alloy ) , platinum
alloys ( usually tungsten ) , isoelastic ( nickel - iron alloy ) , or karma - type
alloy wires ( nickel - chrome alloy ) , foils , or semiconductor materials . 
the most popular alloys used for strain gages are copper - nickel alloys
and nickel - chromium alloys . 
in the mid - 1950s , scientists at bell laboratories discovered the
piezoresistive characteristics of germanium and silicon . although the
materials exhibited substantial nonlinearity and temperature
sensitivity , they had gage factors more than fifty times , and
sensitivity more than a 100 times , that of metallic wire or foil strain
gages . silicon wafers are also more elastic than metallic ones . after
being strained , they return more readily to their original shapes . 
around 1970 , the first semiconductor ( silicon ) strain gages were
developed for the automotive industry . as opposed to other types of
strain gages , semiconductor strain gages depend on the piezoresistive
effects of silicon or germanium and measure the change in resistance
with stress as opposed to strain . the semiconductor bonded strain
gage is a wafer with the resistance element diffused into a substrate
of silicon . the wafer element usually is not provided with a backing , 
and bonding it to the strained surface requires great care as only a
thin layer of epoxy is used to attach it ( figure 2 - 4b ) . the size is much
smaller and the cost much lower than for a metallic foil sensor . the
same epoxies that are used to attach foil gages also are used to bond
semiconductor gages . 
while the higher unit resistance and sensitivity of semiconductor
wafer sensors are definite advantages , their greater sensitivity to
temperature variations and tendency to drift are disadvantages in
comparison to metallic foil sensors . another disadvantage of
semiconductor strain gages is that the resistance - to - strain
relationship is nonlinear , varying 10 - 20% from a straight - line
equation . with computer - controlled instrumentation , these limitations
can be overcome through software compensation . 
a further improvement is the thin - film strain gage that eliminates
the need for adhesive bonding ( figure 2 - 4c ) . the gage is produced by
first depositing an electrical insulation ( typically a ceramic ) onto the
stressed metal surface , and then depositing the strain gage onto this
insulation layer . vacuum deposition or sputtering techniques are used
to bond the materials molecularly . 
because the thin - film gage is molecularly bonded to the specimen , 
the installation is much more stable and the resistance values
experience less drift . another advantage is that the stressed force
detector can be a metallic diaphragm or beam with a deposited layer
of ceramic insulation . 
diffused semiconductor strain gages represent a further
improvement in strain gage technology because they eliminate the
the strain gage page 4 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain . html 11 / 5 / 2008
need for bonding agents . by eliminating bonding agents , errors due to
creep and hysteresis also are eliminated . the diffused semiconductor
strain gage uses photolithography masking techniques and solid - state
diffusion of boron to molecularly bond the resistance elements . 
electrical leads are directly attached to the pattern ( figure 2 - 4d ) . 
the diffused gage is limited to moderate - temperature applications
and requires temperature compensation . diffused semiconductors
often are used as sensing elements in pressure transducers . they are
small , inexpensive , accurate and repeatable , provide a wide pressure
range , and generate a strong output signal . their limitations include
sensitivity to ambient temperature variations , which can be
compensated for in intelligent transmitter designs . 
in summary , the ideal strain gage is small in size and mass , low in
cost , easily attached , and highly sensitive to strain but insensitive to
ambient or process temperature variations . 
bonded resistance gages
the bonded semiconductor strain gage was schematically described in
figures 2 - 4a and 2 - 4b . these devices represent a popular method of
measuring strain . the gage consists of a grid of very fine metallic
wire , foil , or semiconductor material bonded to the strained surface or
carrier matrix by a thin insulated layer of epoxy ( figure 2 - 5 ) . when
the carrier matrix is strained , the strain is transmitted to the grid
material through the adhesive . the variations in the electrical
resistance of the grid are measured as an indication of strain . the grid
shape is designed to provide maximum gage resistance while keeping
both the length and width of the gage to a minimum . 
bonded resistance strain gages have a good reputation . they are
relatively inexpensive , can achieve overall accuracy of better than + / - 
0 . 10% , are available in a short gage length , are only moderately
affected by temperature changes , have small physical size and low
mass , and are highly sensitive . bonded resistance strain gages can be
used to measure both static and dynamic strain . 
figure 2 - 5 : bonded resistance
strain gage construction
the strain gage page 5 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain . html 11 / 5 / 2008
in bonding strain gage elements to a strained surface , it is important
that the gage experience the same strain as the object . with an
adhesive material inserted between the sensors and the strained
surface , the installation is sensitive to creep due to degradation of the
bond , temperature influences , and hysteresis caused by thermoelastic
strain . because many glues and epoxy resins are prone to creep , it is
important to use resins designed specifically for strain gages . 
the bonded resistance strain gage is suitable for a wide variety of
environmental conditions . it can measure strain in jet engine turbines
operating at very high temperatures and in cryogenic fluid
applications at temperatures as low as - 452 f ( - 269 c ) . it has low
mass and size , high sensitivity , and is suitable for static and dynamic
applications . foil elements are available with unit resistances from
120 to 5 , 000 ohms . gage lengths from 0 . 008 in . to 4 in . are available
commercially . the three primary considerations in gage selection are : 
operating temperature , the nature of the strain to be detected , and
stability requirements . in addition , selecting the right carrier material , 
grid alloy , adhesive , and protective coating will guarantee the success
of the application . 
typical metal - foil strain gages .

measuring circuits
in order to measure strain with a bonded resistance strain gage , it
must be connected to an electric circuit that is capable of measuring
the minute changes in resistance corresponding to strain . strain gage
transducers usually employ four strain gage elements electrically
connected to form a wheatstone bridge circuit ( figure 2 - 6 ) . 
a wheatstone bridge is a divided bridge circuit used for the
measurement of static or dynamic electrical resistance . the output
voltage of the wheatstone bridge is expressed in millivolts output per
volt input . the wheatstone circuit is also well suited for temperature
compensation . 
in figure 2 - 6 , if r1 , r2 , r3 , and r4 are equal , and a voltage , vin , is
applied between points a and c , then the output between points b
and d will show no potential difference . however , if r4 is changed to
some value which does not equal r1 , r2 , and r3 , the bridge will
become unbalanced and a voltage will exist at the output terminals . 
in a so - called g - bridge configuration , the variable strain sensor has
resistance rg , while the other arms are fixed value resistors . 
the sensor , however , can occupy one , two , or four arms of the
bridge , depending on the application . the total strain , or output
voltage of the circuit ( vout ) is equivalent to the difference between
the voltage drop across r1 and r4 , or rg . this can also be written as : 
for more detail , see figure 2 - 6 . the bridge is considered balanced
when r1 / r2 = rg / r3 and , therefore , vout equals zero . 
any small change in the resistance of the sensing grid will throw the
figure 2 - 6 : wheatstone bridge circuit schematic
the strain gage page 1 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain2 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
bridge out of balance , making it suitable for the detection of strain . 
when the bridge is set up so that rg is the only active strain gage , a
small change in rg will result in an output voltage from the bridge . if
the gage factor is gf , the strain measurement is related to the
change in rg as follows : 
the number of active strain gages that should be connected to the
bridge depends on the application . for example , it may be useful to
connect gages that are on opposite sides of a beam , one in
compression and the other in tension . in this arrangement , one can
effectively double the bridge output for the same strain . in
installations where all of the arms are connected to strain gages , 
temperature compensation is automatic , as resistance change due to
temperature variations will be the same for all arms of the bridge . 
in a four - element wheatstone bridge , usually two gages are wired in
compression and two in tension . for example , if r1 and r3 are in
tension ( positive ) and r2 and r4 are in compression ( negative ) , then
the output will be proportional to the sum of all the strains measured
separately . for gages located on adjacent legs , the bridge becomes
unbalanced in proportion to the difference in strain . for gages on
opposite legs , the bridge balances in proportion to the sum of the
strains . whether bending strain , axial strain , shear strain , or torsional
strain is being measured , the strain gage arrangement will determine
the relationship between the output and the type of strain being
measured . as shown in figure 2 - 6 , if a positive tensile strain occurs
on gages r2 and r3 , and a negative strain is experienced by gages
r1 and r4 , the total output , vout , would be four times the resistance
of a single gage . 
the chevron bridge
the chevron bridge is illustrated in figure 2 - 7 . it is a multiple channel
arrangement that serves to compensate for the changes in bridgearm
resistances by periodically switching them . here , the four channel
positions are used to switch the digital voltmeter ( dvm ) between gbridge
( one active gage ) and h - bridge ( two active gages ) 
configurations . the dvm measurement device always shares the
power supply and an internal h - bridge . this arrangement is most
popular for strain measurements on rotating machines , where it can

http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain2 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
reduce the number of slip rings required . 
four - wire ohm circuit
although the wheatstone bridge is one of the most popular methods
of measuring electrical resistance , other methods can also be used . 
the main advantage of a four - wire ohm circuit is that the lead wires
do not affect the measurement because the voltage is detected
directly across the strain gage element . 
a four - wire ohm circuit installation might consist of a voltmeter , a
current source , and four lead resistors , r1 , in series with a gage
resistor , rg ( figure 2 - 8 ) . the voltmeter is connected to the ohms
sense terminals of the dvm , and the current source is connected to
the ohms source terminals of the dvm . to measure the value of
strain , a low current flow ( typically one milliampere ) is supplied to the
circuit . while the voltmeter measures the voltage drop across rg , the
absolute resistance value is computed by the multimeter from the
values of current and voltage . 
the measurement is usually done by first measuring the value of
gage resistance in an unstrained condition and then making a second
measurement with strain applied . the difference in the measured
gage resistances divided by the unstrained resistance gives a
fractional value of the strain . this value is used with the gage factor
( gf ) to calculate strain . 
the four - wire circuit is also suitable for automatic voltage offset
compensation . the voltage is first measured when there is no current
flow . this measured value is then subtracted from the voltage reading
when current is flowing . the resulting voltage difference is then used
to compute the gage resistance . because of their sensitivity , four - wire
strain gages are typically used to measure low frequency dynamic
strains . when measuring higher frequency strains , the bridge output
needs to be amplified . the same circuit also can be used with a
semiconductor strain - gage sensor and high speed digital voltmeter . if
the dvm sensitivity is 100 microvolts , the current source is 0 . 44
milliamperes , the strain - gage element resistance is 350 ohms and its
gage factor is 100 , the resolution of the measurement will be 6
microstrains . 
figure 2 - 8 : four - wire ohm circuit schematic
the strain gage page 3 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain2 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
constant current circuit
resistance can be measured by exciting the bridge with either a
constant voltage or a constant current source . because r = v / i , if
either v or i is held constant , the other will vary with the resistance . 
both methods can be used . 
while there is no theoretical advantage to using a constant current
source ( figure 2 - 9 ) as compared to a constant voltage , in some cases
the bridge output will be more linear in a constant current system . 
also , if a constant current source is used , it eliminates the need to
sense the voltage at the bridge; therefore , only two wires need to be
connected to the strain gage element . 
the constant current circuit is most effective when dynamic strain is
being measured . this is because , if a dynamic force is causing a
change in the resistance of the strain gage ( rg ) , one would measure
the time varying component of the output ( vout ) , whereas slowly
changing effects such as changes in lead resistance due to
temperature variations would be rejected . using this configuration , 
temperature drifts become nearly negligible . 
application & installation
the output of a strain gage circuit is a very low - level voltage signal
requiring a sensitivity of 100 microvolts or better . the low level of the
signal makes it particularly susceptible to unwanted noise from other
electrical devices . capacitive coupling caused by the lead wires
running too close to ac power cables or ground currents are potential
error sources in strain measurement . other error sources may include
magnetically induced voltages when the lead wires pass through
variable magnetic fields , parasitic ( unwanted ) contact resistances of
lead wires , insulation failure , and thermocouple effects at the junction
of dissimilar metals . the sum of such interferences can result in
significant signal degradation . 
shielding
most electric interference and noise problems can be solved by
shielding and guarding . a shield around the measurement lead wires
will intercept interferences and may also reduce any errors caused by
insulation degradation . shielding also will guard the measurement
from capacitive coupling . if the measurement leads are routed near
electromagnetic interference sources such as transformers , twisting
the leads will minimize signal degradation due to magnetic induction . 
by twisting the wire , the flux - induced current is inverted and the
areas that the flux crosses cancel out . for industrial process
applications , twisted and shielded lead wires are used almost without
figure 2 - 9 : constant current circuit schematic
the strain gage page 4 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain2 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
exception . 
guarding
guarding the instrumentation itself is just as important as shielding
the wires . a guard is a sheet - metal box surrounding the analog
circuitry and is connected to the shield . if ground currents flow
through the strain - gage element or its lead wires , a wheatstone
bridge circuit cannot distinguish them from the flow generated by the
current source . guarding guarantees that terminals of electrical
components are at the same potential , which thereby prevents
extraneous current flows . 
connecting a guard lead between the test specimen and the
negative terminal of the power supply provides an additional current
path around the measuring circuit . by placing a guard lead path in the
path of an error - producing current , all of the elements involved ( i . e . , 
floating power supply , strain gage , all other measuring equipment ) 
will be at the same potential as the test specimen . by using twisted
and shielded lead wires and integrating dvms with guarding , common
mode noise error can virtually be eliminated . 
lead - wire effects
strain gages are sometimes mounted at a distance from the
measuring equipment . this increases the possibility of errors due to
temperature variations , lead desensitization , and lead - wire resistance
changes . in a two - wire installation ( figure 2 - 10a ) , the two leads are
in series with the strain - gage element , and any change in the leadwire
resistance ( r1 ) will be indistinguishable from changes in the
resistance of the strain gage ( rg ) . 
to correct for lead - wire effects , an additional , third lead can be
introduced to the top arm of the bridge , as shown in figure 2 - 10b . in
this configuration , wire c acts as a sense lead with no current flowing
in it , and wires a and b are in opposite legs of the bridge . this is the
minimum acceptable method of wiring strain gages to a bridge to
cancel at least part of the effect of extension wire errors . 
theoretically , if the lead wires to the sensor have the same nominal
resistance , the same temperature coefficient , and are maintained at
the same temperature , full compensation is obtained . in reality , wires
are manufactured to a tolerance of about 10% , and three - wire
figure 2 - 10 : alternative lead - wire configurations
the strain gage page 5 of 6
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain2 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
installation does not completely eliminate two - wire errors , but it does
reduce them by an order of magnitude . if further improvement is
desired , four - wire and offset - compensated installations ( figures 2 - 
10c and 2 - 10d ) should be considered . 
in two - wire installations , the error introduced by lead - wire
resistance is a function of the resistance ratio r1 / rg . the lead error is
usually not significant if the lead - wire resistance ( r1 ) is small in
comparison to the gage resistance ( rg ) , but if the lead - wire
resistance exceeds 0 . 1% of the nominal gage resistance , this source
of error becomes significant . therefore , in industrial applications , 
lead - wire lengths should be minimized or eliminated by locating the
transmitter directly at the sensor . 
temperature and the gage factor
strain - sensing materials , such as copper , change their internal
structure at high temperatures . temperature can alter not only the
properties of a strain gage element , but also can alter the properties
of the base material to which the strain gage is attached . differences
in expansion coefficients between the gage and base materials may
cause dimensional changes in the sensor element . 
expansion or contraction of the strain - gage element and / or the base
material introduces errors that are difficult to correct . for example , a
change in the resistivity or in the temperature coefficient of resistance
of the strain gage element changes the zero reference used to
calibrate the unit . 
the gage factor is the strain sensitivity of the sensor . the
manufacturer should always supply data on the temperature
sensitivity of the gage factor . figure 2 - 11 shows the variation in gage
factors of the various strain gage materials as a function of operating
temperature . copper - nickel alloys such as advance have gage factors
that are relatively sensitive to operating temperature variations , 
making them the most popular choice for strain gage materials . 
figure 2 - 11 : gage - factor temperature dependence
top of page next chapter : the strain gage continued
apparent strain
apparent strain is any change in gage resistance that is not caused by
the strain on the force element . apparent strain is the result of the
interaction of the thermal coefficient of the strain gage and the
difference in expansion between the gage and the test specimen . the
variation in the apparent strain of various strain - gage materials as a
function of operating temperature is shown in figure 2 - 12 . in addition
to the temperature effects , apparent strain also can change because
of aging and instability of the metal and the bonding agent . 
compensation for apparent strain is necessary if the temperature
varies while the strain is being measured . in most applications , the
amount of error depends on the alloy used , the accuracy required , 
and the amount of the temperature variation . if the operating
temperature of the gage and the apparent strain characteristics are
known , compensation is possible . 
stability considerations
it is desirable that the strain - gage measurement system be stable
and not drift with time . in calibrated instruments , the passage of time
always causes some drift and loss of calibration . the stability of
bonded strain - gage transducers is inferior to that of diffused straingage
elements . hysteresis and creeping caused by imperfect bonding
is one of the fundamental causes of instability , particularly in high
operating temperature environments . 
before mounting strain - gage elements , it should be established that
the stressed force detector itself is uniform and homogeneous , 
because any surface deformities will result in instability errors . in
order to remove any residual stresses in the force detectors , they
should be carefully annealed , hardened , and stress - relieved using
temperature aging . a transducer that uses force - detector springs , 
diaphragms , or bellows should also be provided with mechanical
isolation . this will protect the sensor element from external stresses
caused either by the strain of mounting or by the attaching of electric
conduits to the transducer .

with temperature
the strain gage page 1 of 3
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain3 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
if stable sensors are used , such as deposited thin - film element
types , and if the force - detector structure is well designed , balancing
and compensation resistors will be sufficient for periodic recalibration
of the unit . the most stable sensors are made from platinum or other
low - temperature coefficient materials . it is also important that the
transducer be operated within its design limits . otherwise , permanent
calibration shifts can result . exposing the transducer to temperatures
outside its operating limits can also degrade performance . similarly , 
the transducer should be protected from vibration , acceleration , and
shock . 
transducer designs
strain gages are used to measure displacement , force , load , pressure , 
torque or weight . modern strain - gage transducers usually employ a
grid of four strain elements electrically connected to form a
wheatstone bridge measuring circuit . 
the strain - gage sensor is one of the most widely used means of
load , weight , and force detection . in figure 2 - 13a , a vertical beam is
subjected to a force acting on the vertical axis . as the force is applied , 
the support column experiences elastic deformation and changes the
electrical resistance of each strain gage . by the use of a wheatstone
bridge , the value of the load can be measured . load cells are popular
weighing elements for tanks and silos and have proven accurate in
many other weighing applications . 
strain gages may be bonded to cantilever springs to measure the
force of bending ( figure 2 - 13b ) . the strain gages mounted on the top
of the beam experience tension , while the strain gages on the bottom
experience compression . the transducers are wired in a wheatstone
circuit and are used to determine the amount of force applied to the
beam . 
strain - gage elements also are used widely in the design of industrial
pressure transmitters . figure 2 - 13c shows a bellows type pressure
sensor in which the reference pressure is sealed inside the bellows on
the right , while the other bellows is exposed to the process pressure . 
when there is a difference between the two pressures , the strain
detector elements bonded to the cantilever beam measure the
resulting compressive or tensile forces . 
figure 2 - 13 : strain gage installation alternatives
the strain gage page 2 of 3
http : / / www . omega . com / literature / transactions / volume3 / strain3 . html 11 / 5 / 2008
a diaphragm - type pressure transducer is created when four strain
gages are attached to a diaphragm ( figure 2 - 13d ) . when the process
pressure is applied to the diaphragm , the two central gage elements
are subjected to tension , while the two gages at the edges are
subjected to compression . the corresponding changes in resistance
are a measure of the process pressure . when all of the strain gages
are subjected to the same temperature , such as in this design , errors
due to operating temperature variations are reduced . 
installation diagnostics
all strain gage installations should be checked using the following
steps : 
1 . measure the base resistance of the unstrained strain gage
after it is mounted , but before wiring is connected . 
2 . check for surface contamination by measuring the isolation
resistance between the gage grid and the stressed force
detector specimen using an ohmmeter , if the specimen is
conductive . this should be done before connecting the lead
wires to the instrumentation . if the isolation resistance is under
500 megaohms , contamination is likely . 
3 . check for extraneous induced voltages in the circuit by
reading the voltage when the power supply to the bridge is
disconnected . bridge output voltage readings for each straingage
channel should be nearly zero . 
4 . connect the excitation power supply to the bridge and
ensure both the correct voltage level and its stability . 
5 . check the strain gage bond by applying pressure to the
gage . the reading should be unaffected .

i will not fret the future my success and happiness does not depend on straining to see what lurks dimly on the horizon but to do this day what lies clearly at hand 

i will treasure this day for it is all i have i know that its rushing hours cannot be accumulated or stored like precious grain for future use 

i will live as all good actors do when they are onstage only in the moment i cannot perform at my best today by regretting my previous acts mistakes or worrying about the scene to come 

i will embrace todays difficult tasks take off my coat and make dust in the world i will remember that the busier i am the less harm i am apt to suffer the tastier will be my food the sweeter my sleep and the better satisfied i will be with my place in the world 

i will free myself today from slavery to the clock and calendar although i will plan this day in order to conserve my steps and energy i will begin to measure my life in deeds not years; in thoughts not seasons; in feelings not figures on a dial 

i will remain aware of how little it takes to make this a happy day never will i pursue happiness because it is not a goal just a by product and there is no happiness in having or in getting only in giving 

i will run from no danger i might encounter today because i am certain that nothing will happen to me that i am not equipped to handle with your help just as any gem is polished by friction i am certain to become more valuable through this days adversities and if you close one do or you always open another for me 

i will live this day as if it were christmas i will be a giver of gifts and deliver to my enemies the gift of forgiveness; my opponents tolerance; my friends a smile; my children a good example and every gift will be wrapped with unconditional love 

i will waste not even a precious second today in anger or hate or jealousy or selfishness i know that the seeds i sow i will harvest because every action good or bad is always followed by an equal reaction i will plant only good seeds this day 

i will treat today as a priceless violin one may draw harmony from it and another discord yet no one will blame the instrument life is the same and if i play it correctly it will give forth beauty but if i play it ignorantly it will produce ugliness 

i will condition myself to look on every problem i encounter today as no more than a
pebble in my shoe i remember the pain so harsh i could hardly walk and recall my surprise when i removed my shoe and found only a grain of sand 

i will work convinced that nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm to do anything today that is truly worth doing i must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger but jump in with gusto and scramble through as well as i can 

i will face the world with goals set for this day but they will be attainable ones not the vague impossible variety declared by those who make a career of failure i realize that you always try me with a little first to see what i would do with a lot 

i will never hide my talents if i am silent i am forgotten if i do not advance i will fall back if i walk away from any challenge today my self esteem will be forever scarred and if i cease to grow even a little i will become smaller i reject the stationary position because it is always the beginning of the end 

i will keep a smile on my face and in my heart even when it hurts today i know that the world is a looking glass and gives back to me the reflection of my own soul now i understand the secret of correcting the attitude of others and that is to correct my own 

i will turn away from any temptation today might cause me to break my word or that lose " my self respect i am positive that the more valuable than my only thing i possess life is my honor i will work this day with all my strength content in the knowledge that life does not consist of wallowing in the past or peering anxiously at the future it is appalling to contemplate the great number of painful steps by which one arrives at a truth so old so obvious and so frequently expressed whatever it offers little or much my life is now 

i will pause whenever i am feeling sorry for myself today and remember that this is the only day i have and i must play it to the fullest what my part may signify in the great whole i may not recognize but i am here to play it and now is the time i will count this day a separate life i will remember that those who have fewest regrets are those who take each moment as it comes for all that it is worth 

this is my day 
these are my seeds 
thank you god for this precious garden time 

a story tells that two friends were walking through the desert during some point of the journey they had an argument and one friend slapped the other one in the face 

the one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything wrote in the sand :

 " today my best friend slapped me in the face " 

they kept on walking until they found an oasis where they decided to take a bath the one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning but the friend saved him after he recovered from the near drowning he wrote on a stone :

 " today my best friend saved my life " 

the friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him " after i hurt you you wrote in the sand and now you write on a stone why " the other friend replied : " when someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away but when someone does something good for us we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it " 

learn to write your hurts in the sand and to carve your benefits in stone 

 they say it takes a minute to find a special person an hour to appreciate them a day to love them but then an entire life to forget them


subject : clergy letter re : homosexual quandary 
date : 1998 05 27
 

was out of the office for lunch yesterday so it wasnt until early this morning when i listened to the tape recording that i heard the monologue on the east coast bell lawsuit when that fellow said his " domestic partner " had just as many rights as gay " domestic partners " – if not why not 

i have resisted – for the past five years ive been listening and the past three ive been faxing – sending you any thoughts about the homosexual issue i know hundreds to thousands of folks have already been taking you to task and getting in your face from both sides on a regular basis ive always wanted to accentuate the positive – the common ground upon which we stand but my heart was touched by your honest sincere expressions of the difficulties you experience wrestling with this thorny issue 

i strongly suspect that your " quandary " has intensified in direct proportion to the increase of the strength of your conviction that god says no and you accept that as the standard at the same time you are holding on to your long held conviction that folks " are what they are " emotionally physiologically sexually etc yet both old and new testaments clearly decisively and prolifically condemn and denounce lesbianism and homosexuality i know that was a lousy sentence but 

it seems clear to me that there might well be a natural biological pre disposition for some women to be masculine and some men to be feminine almost as if that " womb wash " that triggers the gender change in utero doesnt quite take too there might be other factors involved but as of yet not understood that give a man or a woman a pre disposition towards same sex attraction 

grant that all of this is true what are we left with whats the bottom line if you are going to believe we are made in the image of god and that he is our creator then know the following 

 he is certainly aware of the naturally occurring anomalies that will occasionally / inevitably occur in the case of those who are born to it – if indeed thats the case 

 he is certainly aware of the arbitrarily created anomalies that will occasionally / inevitably occur in the case of those who choose to lust for it – known to be the case in many instances 

 either way he made no bones about the wrong or sin of lesbianism/homosexual sex made no allowances for it at all 

 that should tell us something that it is an impulse/condition/reality / temptation that can be controlled and is expected & required by god to be controlled and is he not a god of supreme compassion then it would not not imply a lack of compassion on our part when we stand against it / forbid it / condemn it – as a perversion of gods ideal no more than it implies a lack of compassion on his part when he stands against it / forbids it / condemns it no more than it implies a lack of compassion or understanding when we condemn 

a sex outside of marriage fornication because god does and he is compassionate 

b sex outside of a covenant adultery because god does and he is compassionate 

c necrophilia because god does and he is compassionate 

d pedophilia because god does and he is compassionate 

e ad infinitum because god does and he is compassionate 

if sexuality in a committed monogamous life time relationship is the ultimate pleasure joy and satisfaction and therefore gods ideal and his expectation if god does not allow for anything else then we should trust him that everyone can aspire to that and attain that it just might be more difficult for some than others if someone should call your show and they have from time to time talking about the intensity of their sex drive and they were a fornicator adulterer necrophiliac or pedophiliac – would you not simply cite the standard – what god has said and is therefore possible – if they summon the character courage conscience and faith to choose that do you not tell them not to give in to their urges like animals rutting in season 

when it comes to the 10 commandments you stand firm and permit no negotiation no compromise no dilution no rationalization at the same time you maintain your compassion intact that it is different for you when it comes to homosexuality is a commentary of your subjective not the objective something you dont have much truck with or tolerate much of from others who call your show like charles the other day when you so aptly pointed out that there was a time when true love personal feelings were not an issue at all that marriages were pre arranged fore ordained yet – people learned out of necessity to make them not only succeed but succeed magnificently 

when we you and i speak of how gods expressed will simplifies our life we are speaking of that truth youve seen me write before man is not the author of virtue or vice – god is and our responsibility as creatures made in his image is to respect and honor his definitions 

the weird part about the communique is that i think you already know this in your teeny weeny bones you know this i appreciate you not giving up when you were speaking of the quandary the confusion the difficulty of this issue for you i couldnt help but think of jacob on the banks of the jabbok wrestling lone all night refusing to give up and because he did not give up he came away ultimately blessed limping but blessed 

keep up the great work and hang in there
