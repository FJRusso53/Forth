hey there old friend hope the new year finds you health and happy
2017 went out with a bang for me it can only get better from here
i hope pinched a nerve in my back again second time in 15 months got to remember i am not 27
anymore and need to go find some high schoolers to do it for me
i am about 75 % back to normal at least the pain level is way down god bless chiropractors and physical therapist
all my orthopedic doctor did was push meds at me i was sleeping in a rocker recliner for ~ 3 weeks
I finally got to return to my bed this past week
2 knee replacements ? woo your stronger than me
i thought i was going to need to have that done having been a runner all my life
I gave up the running ~ 8 years so far i am holding it at bay
got a couple of friends and work cohorts who retired this past year or will this coming year
i am down to 18 months now more than likely going to stay in savannah
i would say warm winters well warmer than what you are looking at we did get 3 inches of snow the first week in jan
i love my job and what i do i am just getting tired of it looking forward to being able to do anything i want to
what is it i want to do ? well i do have hobbies gardening and i can garden here in savannah 9 months out of 12
wood working love to refinish furniture and of course there is fishing something i have not been able to do in a very long time
i love to program but after sitting at the computer all day long i simply do not want to do it when i get home
if i can work either as a consultant or contractor 2 - 3 days a week that is an option
leave the 5 days a week 40 - 50 hours to the youth
you did not say where your son is going to med school at i assume one of the philly schools he is what 25 now ?
where has the time gone
my oldest tim turned 41 last august yea i am old but you know what i like being my age except for the body wearing out thing
am i still married ? no just finally finished my divorce that has taken 2 1/2 years i hate lawyers the ex was the real problem
it is like a breath of fresh air
in reality i should have done it many years ago but the italian catholic in me kept telling me i had to endure
went to mass last night so i slept in this morning
chilly here this morning but i think you would feel spring has sprung if you had this weather
stay well and healthy
frank
forget yesterday - it is gone
ignore tomorrow - it may not come
embrace today - it is all you have
