how long was she planning to leave him this way ? was it even possible for her to
wake him she would jostled him after he collapsed to the ground while trying to
move him into a more comfortable position  and he had not stirred  she could cut
the vine and sever the connection but doing so might be as damaging to him as
abruptly severing mia connection with meno had been to mia no she did not dare risk it
so the answer was as long as it took she would wait did not mean she had to like it
the wind picked up   raising goosebumps on her arms she crossed them over her chest

not deliberately there was a lot of leakage from everyone when we first set up the
noesis she did not mean to reveal any private information the noesis was
what he and the other prevos dubbed the quantum connection that existed between
them for it went beyond any existing form of communication network or data
transfer all the way to the cusp of consciousness sharing
i am sure she did not abigail sighed and turned away from the plaque 
enough wallowing it is time to let jules rest and for us to get back to work
he ceded to her urging and fell in beside her as they strode toward the entrance
the clack clack of her heels on the marble floor echoed through the long
hallway like bells tolling an elegy for the dead who surrounded them
finally he spoke just to drown out the unknown location
it is time to wake up mia
a wispy murmur in the blackness blackness where before there was only
nothingness it was dark inky and thick but there now existed the palpable sense of tangibility
she gasped in alarm  but no sound came out of her throat   where am i ? she
shouted  but no words made it past her lips it is all right mia you are safe
the faint memory of a nanosecond of searing pain cleaving through her brain haunted
the edges of her consciousness am i dead ?
no you are very much alive   you were sick   but youre better now
she tried to blink  but there was no
as if the lashes were glued together   her eyes watered it stung but after
considerable coaxing her eyelids opened a sliver  light seeped in through a
hazy  glycerin coated filter  yet even with the haze her irises recoiled
forcing her lids closed
a little daunted she paused to take stock of her situation in other ways   she

noises   but nothing noteworthy   merely the sounds of living  
she steeled herself and tried again   forcing her lids open and blinking rapidly to
try to clear the gooey haze

hospital bed ; a long window to her left ; beyond the bed   a closed door  
as the harshness of the real world came

2 1  all pc's   check network profile and network discovery and share settings
sometimes this selection to change between private and public network profile is missing from settings / networks page   in that case profile must change by powershell   right click windows icon ( start button ) and open powershell ( admin ) and use following commands to get interface index number and change profile to private ( or public )   get - net connection profile
set - net connection profile - interface index < index number > - network category private
2 2  all pc ' s  check network discovery and share settings
3  all pc ' s  set start type to automatic and start following services that allow pc ' s to be visible on network   ( reboot )
push win key and type " services "   locate these services

4  setting shares  
4 1  check your current shares  
open file explorer and type  localhost to address bar to see what shares are made in this computer  
4 2  create new share ( here i use folder " test " )  
( setting " turn on sharing so anyone … " in step 2 2  make share for folders in c  users automatic   )
folder is now shared and network share path is     pcnametest
4 3  safe way to share folders  
create user account to all users on your network to whom you want to give access to shared resources  
use same user id and password which they have on their own computers  
right click " test " and open properties and select security tab to see current settings  
default security settings are shown in next picture  
those settings allow access to shared folders only for those users who have user id on that computer  
image
4 4  sharing folder " test " to everyone " ( very unsafe setting ! think carefully do you need to select this ! )
if you want that everyone have access to that share then go to security tab and  
- click edit
- on permission dialog click add  
- new dialog open and you can add " everyone " to that list
- when back to permissions dialog select which rights you want to give to " everyone "  
now anyone on your home network should have access to shared folders without credentials or having user account on your computer  
5  now when click network on file explorer all your pc's should be visible in computer and network sections  
this should be cover the essentials to sharing your data over local network   this share is not limited to c  users folder   every folder can be handled like shown in steps 4  
now your pc's should visible   but if not then try to reset all network settings  
go to settings / network & internet / status   scroll down to find " network reset   on next window click " reset now " button  
it will takes about 5 min to perform this reset and then pc reboot automatic  
when you sign in first time you get notification something like " do you want your pc to be access by other computers "   click yes for that
