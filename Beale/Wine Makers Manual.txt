preface 

most home winemaking books are written like cookbooks they contain winemaking recipes and step by step directions but little technical information is included the goal of these books is to provide enough information so the reader can make a successful batch of wine enology textbooks are the other extreme they are very technical and can be difficult to comprehend without a background in chemistry and microbiology these books are intended to give professional winemakers the specialized backgrounds needed to solve the wide variety of problems encountered in commercial wine production 
this book is an attempt to provide beginning home winemakers with basic how to instructions as well as providing an introduction to some of the more technical aspects of winemaking however the technical material has been concentrated in a few chapters so readers can easily ignore much of the technical content until an interest develops 
if you have a quantity of fresh grapes to convert into wine read chapter 1 and the first few pages of appendix a this material will give you enough information to start a successful grape wine fermentation appendix a is written in a quasi outline form and it provides a brief description of the entire winemaking process 
if you have some fresh fruit and wish to make wine before the fruit spoils read chapter 21 this is a stand alone chapter and successful fruit wines can be made from the information provided here the first few pages provide enough information to prepare the fruit and start fermentation the rest of the chapter can then be read at your leisure 
chapters 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 12 14 15 and 17 provide general information on home winemaking these chapters discuss materials facilities equipment and basic processes much of this material is basic and should be of interest to most readers 
the material presented in chapters 5 6 11 13 and 16 is a bit more advanced these five chapters focus mostly on what and why rather than on how beginning winemakers may wish to skip these chapters until they become more experienced 
chapters 18 and 19 are case studies of making a red and white wine these two chapters provide a detailed chronology of the production of two typical wines 
chapter 20 describes hot to make small quantities of sparkling wine and chapter 22 contains practical how to information of general interest 
chapter 23 describes six common laboratory wine tests the significance of the tests materials apparatus and procedures are discussed 
i hope you enjoy my little book on home winemaking

chapter 1 

the winemaking process 
winemaking can be divided into four basic phases the first phase consists of finding a source of high quality fruit and making sure the grapes are harvested in an optimum condition buying small quantities of high quality fruit is not easy and this is the most difficult winemaking phase for home winemakers 
the second phase consists of fermenting the grapes into wine winemakers manage the fermentation by controlling several different fermentation parameters such as temperature skin contact time pressing technique etc 
during the third phase the new wine is clarified and stabilized winemakers clarify wine by fining racking and filtration wine is stabilized by removing excessive protein and potassium hydrogen tartrate potassium bi tartrate these materials must be removed to prevent them from precipitating out of the wine later 
in the fourth phase of winemaking the winemaker ages the wine most high quality wines are aged in bulk and then for an additional time in the bottle winemakers have an active role throughout the lengthy bulk aging process wines are smelled tasted and measured every few weeks and any needed adjustments are made promptly 
except for the first phase the other three winemaking phases overlap each other new wine starts to clarify toward the end of the fermentation period some tartrates precipitate out during primary fermentation and the wine becomes more stable of course wine is aging throughout the winemaking process each phase makes a specific contribution to wine characteristics but the first phase has the greatest influence on wine quality 
red wines and white wines 
high quality red wine grapes have colorless juice all of the red color is in the grape skins and winemakers must leave the juice in contact with the skins for a considerable time to extract the color red wine is made by crushing the grapes and then fermenting the juice the pulp the skins and the seeds together for several days near the end of sugar fermentation a wine press is used to separate the liquid from the solid materials 
white wine is made by a different process first the grapes are crushed and pressed immediately to separate the juice from the solids after pressing the skins stems and seeds are discarded and the juice is cooled to a low temperature then the cold juice is allowed to settle for several hours and the clear juice is decanted off the residue before it is fermented white wine is made by fermenting clarified juice these are the fundamental differences between making quality red wine and white wine at first glance the two winemaking processes may appear similar because several steps are identical nevertheless the steps are done in a different sequence and the sequence makes a large change in wine characteristics the two processes are shown in figure 1 
in the vineyard 
it has often been said that wine quality is made in the vineyard and few experienced winemakers disagree with this statement the 
red wine process
soil climate the viticulture and all other aspects of the vineyard 
crush ferment 
environment contribute to the quality of the wine even if the 
press clarify 
winemaker does a perfect job the quality of the starting grapes 
stabilize age 
always determines the potential quality of the wine grape quality 
bottle 
is extremely important many winemakers feel that when a grape growing problem develops the difficulty must be recognized and 

white wine process
promptly resolved to assure fruit quality consequently both 
crush press 
professional and amateur winemakers prefer to grow their own 
settle ferment 
grapes then they have complete control over the vineyards 
clarify stabilize 
 age bottle 
fermentation 
figure 1 red wines and white 
wine are produced using
two different fermentations occur in most red wines and these 

different winemaking processes 
same fermentations are often encouraged in heavier styled white wines like chardonnay or sauvignon blanc in addition a variety of yeast and bacteria can grow in wine and many of these microorganisms can cause other fermentations 
primary fermentation 
conversion of the two major grape sugars glucose and fructose into ethyl alcohol is called primary fermentation yeast in the wine produce enzymes and the enzymes convert the sugars into alcohol converting grape sugars into alcohol is not a simple process many steps are involved in this transformation and the yeast must produce several different enzymes 
malolactic fermentation 
malic acid in the grapes is converted into lactic acid during the secondary fermentation the necessary enzymes are produced by bacteria rather than by yeast several different types of bacteria can produce malolactic ml fermentation and these bacteria are called lactic bacteria lactic acid is weaker than malic acid so malolactic fermentation reduces the overall acidity of the wine in addition some byproducts produced during the ml fermentation can make a positive contribution to the complexity of the wine 
other fermentations 
depending upon the winemaking conditions several other fermentations can and often do occur in wine some bacteria can ferment the glycerol in the wine into lactic and acetic acids the natural grape sugars can be transformed into lactic and acetic acid by other types of bacteria a few species of bacteria can ferment the tartaric acid in the wine into lactic acid acetic acid and carbon dioxide gas vinegar bacteria can convert the alcohol into acetic acid then the same bacteria convert the acetic acid into water and carbon dioxide gas these other transformations can produce materials that detract from wine quality sometimes these undesirable fermentations can be devastating and when such fermentations occur wine is often called diseased or sick 
during the fermentation phase the primary function of the winemaker is to make sure that the primary and secondary fermentations take place in a controlled and judicious way making sure the unwanted fermentations do not occur is also important so the wine is measured smelled and tasted often 
clarification & stabilization 
at the end of the primary fermentation the new wine contains many spent yeast cells several different types of bacteria tartrate crystals small fragments of grape tissue bits of dirt etc all these particles interact with light that passes through the new wine the particles absorb or scatter the light and they give the wine an opaque turbid appearance 
gravity will slowly pull most of these particles down to the bottom of the wine container then the winemaker can decant the clear wine off the sediment the larger sized particles may settle out in a day or two but smaller particles may take several weeks to fall some suspended material may be so small it never completely settles out of the wine after gravity has removed most of the impurities from the wine the winemaker may add a fining material to help the settling process alternatively most commercial winemakers would choose to filter the wine and mechanically remove the remaining particles 
at this stage of its evolution the wine may be clear and bright but the wine probably is not completely stable in other words the wine may not remain in a clear condition over an extended time most wines contain excessive amounts of protein and potassium hydrogen tartrate when wine is stored under certain conditions the protein and the tartrate can precipitate out of the wine and produce a haze or a sediment any white or blush wine will probably be a total loss if either of these materials precipitates after the wine has been bottled wine stability is very important to the winemaker because of the protein and tartrate problems 
several techniques have been developed to remove excessive amounts of protein and tartrate from wine and these procedures are part of the normal winemaking process after the excess protein and tartrate materials have been removed the wine will be chemically stable then the winemaker can continue 21the winemaking process with reasonable assurance that the wine will remain clear and bright after it has been bottled 
wine aging 
odors in the wine that came directly from the grapes are called wine aroma bouquet is the term used for the odors in the wine produced by the winemaking process and winemakers use the term nose when 
referring to both the aroma and the bouquet components 
aroma 
wine aromas come from the grapes aromas do not result from the winemaking process cabernet sauvignon wine smells like cabernet sauvignon because of specific aromatic materials in that particular variety of grape the grassy aroma so characteristic of sauvignon blanc wine is a consequence of the grape variety not the winemaking process 
bouquet 
the formation of wine bouquet is a more complicated process wine bouquet is a result of the winemaking process wine bouquet is produced by the yeast bacteria barrels winemaking procedures etc some bouquet components are prevalent soon after the completion of fermentation but these components decrease in intensity with time other bouquet components may require several years to develop fully byproducts produced by the yeast contribute to the fresh fruity nose so typical of white table wines such as gewurztraminer riesling and chenin blanc however these odor components are short lived they often disappear in less than a year or so consequently these types of wines are best consumed when they are young and the nose is still fresh and fruity 
bouquet components decrease remain constant or increase in intensity as the wine ages byproducts produced by lactic bacteria can give wines a lasting buttery attribute wines stored in oak barrels slowly accumulate vanillin and other substances from the wood wine acids react with alcohols to produce volatile esters and during bulk storage oxidation slowly changes many wine ingredients all these different materials contribute to the bouquet of the wine 
after the wine is bottled oxygen is no longer available and a different type of aging begins to take place winemakers call these transformations reduction reactions because they take place without oxygen reduction aging is responsible for the changes that produce bottle bouquet this is the bouquet that develops after a wine has been in the bottle for some time as a wine ages the aroma gradually decreases and the wine becomes less and less varietal in character wine becomes more vinous as the aroma decreases and the bouquet increases when wines are blind tasted wine experts sometimes have trouble distinguishing old zinfandel wines from old cabernet sauvignon wines 
summary 
winemaking can be divided into four major steps first grapes are harvested in optimum condition second the grapes are fermented in the third step the new wine is clarified and stabilized in the last step the wine is aged to enhance its sensory qualities each of the four steps contributes to the quality of the finished wine however basic wine quality is determined in the first step 
the potential quality of any wine is established when the grapes are selected and harvested once the fruit is harvested the winemaker attempts to realize the potential quality by carefully guiding the wine through the other three winemaking steps making high quality wine from poor quality grapes is impossible but making poor quality wine from high quality grapes is very easy 
the winemaking process may take a few months or it can extend for several years during this time many procedures and operations are performed so winemakers keep accurate records of the procedures used to make each wine this record documents the winemaking details starting from several weeks before the grapes were harvested until the wine is bottled

home winemaking costs 
a great deal of expensive equipment is not required to make 50 gallons of wine grape crushers and wine presses can be rented by the day for a few dollars each used barrels can be purchased for less than fifty dollars and the deposit on a 15 gallon beer keg is about fifteen dollars each year home winemakers ferment large quantities of red wine in new 32 gallon plastic trash cans much of the equipment needed to produce small quantities of wine can be found around the home 
fruit quantity 
wine is measured by the case and a case contains approximately 2 4 gallons of wine estimating just how much wine can be made from a ton of grapes is difficult the amount depends upon the grape variety the equipment used and the winemaking methods employed professional winemakers often get 160 to 180 gallons of wine per ton of grapes home winemakers working with small basket presses are doing well to get 150 gallons of wine per ton of fruit one hundred and fifty gallons represent about 62 cases of wine 
wine grapes are bought and sold by the ton the price of a ton of grapes will depend upon the grape variety the location of the vineyard and upon supply and demand in 1994 napa valley cabernet sauvignon grapes sold for about 1200 a ton temecula cabernet sold for around 600 and cabernet grown in the bakersfield area sold for less than 500 a ton representative prices for
 several varieties of wine grapes grown in the temecula valley are shown in table 1 when home winemakers purchase fruit in 100

pound quantities they often pay a premium price and grapes purchased by the pound often cost three or four times the per ton price 
package cost 

table wine is a very perishable food product wine oxidizes quite easily and wine is susceptible to attack by a variety of microorganisms if wine is going to be stored for any significant time it must be sealed in air tight containers and stored in a cool dark environment 
the standard package for quality wine consists of a 750 milliliter glass bottle a standard 1 3/4 inch cork a capsule and an appropriate label to identify the contents the costs of the fruit and the costs of the package are the major out of pocket expenses for the home winemaker 
glass 
glass bottles are packed in standard cardboard cartons and the glass is clean and sterile when it leaves the factory glass bottles are heavy so shipping costs are high consequently glass is normally shipped in truckload lots and the quantities are quite large smaller commercial wineries often pool resources and buy a truckload of bottles to reduce their glass costs this is why the home winemaker seldom has access to new glass the average home winemaker really has only two alternatives the winemaker must either wash his own or rely on commercially re sterilized used bottles commercial bottle washing enterprises usually charge 4 00 to 5 00 for a case of re sterilized glass unfortunately re sterilized glass is usually hard to find and sometimes it is not available at all ecovin has re sterilized glass available for about 4 00 per case but they are in the san francisco bay area and shipping costs can be high 
corks 
standard wine corks are sold in large sealed polyethylene bags containing one thousand corks the bags are gassed with sulfur dioxide and the humidity in the bag is carefully controlled the corks are sterile until the bag is opened dry corks taken from a new bag are soft and pliable and they can be driven into a bottle easily unfortunately corks dehydrate quickly and become hard after the bag is opened and old dry corks are difficult to drive good quality corks sell for about 135 a bag 
capsules 
capsules are purely decorative home winemakers generally use push on or heat shrink plastic capsules plastic capsules are shipped by the manufacturer in large cardboard cartons that contain about five thousand capsules 
labels 
all wine should have a label permanently attached to each bottle to identify the contents custom wine labels are easy to make using a home computer and very attractive labels can be made for a few cents each however full color labels printed on heavy weight papers often cost more than twenty five cents each when they are produced in the small numbers needed by most home winemakers 
representative wine cost 
the following example illustrates possible home winemaking costs please note that the costs given here assume the grapes and most of the winemaking supplies are purchased in commercial quantities a ton of local wine grapes might cost 600 and produce 62 cases of finished wine here the cost of the fruit needed to produce one case of wine would be 9 68 the cost of re sterilized glass might be 5 00 per case and corks might cost 1 50 per case label costs can range from less than 0 50 to more than 3 00 per case however pleasing labels can be made on a home computer for less than 0 60 per dozen 
 plastic capsules cost from 0 40 to 0 60 per case the cost of miscellaneous winemaking materials like acid sulfite etc will depend upon the characteristics of the wine an average cost of about 0 65 per case is a good estimate

estimates do not include the original

summary 
wine is very perishable and table wine spoils quickly unless it is sealed in air tight containers the standard package for quality wine consists of a 750 ml glass bottle a 1 3/4 inch cork a capsule and an appropriate label the cost of homemade wine depends on the cost of the grapes and the cost of the package the cost of the fruit and the package are about equal when 600 per ton grapes are used but the package cost is dominant when expensive grapes are used home winemakers can reduce their winemaking costs by purchasing grapes by the ton and supplies in commercial quantities washing used wine bottles is another way to reduce home winemaking costs

equipment



 and
 facilities 

home made wines are usually produced in five fifteen thirty fifty sixty or 160 gallon quantities some of these quantities may seem a bit strange but containers having these specific capacities are readily available wine reacts with oxygen in the air as the size of the container becomes smaller producing high quality wine becomes more difficult because of oxidation problems a one gallon container is suitable for bulk storing wine for only a few months five gallon water bottles are readily available and they are popular with home winemakers however water bottles are marginal bulk wine containers because of their small size 
small quantities of wine can be made in the kitchen or on a bench in the garage and little special equipment is needed however a larger work space and access to some winemaking equipment will be necessary when fifty gallons of wine are made each year when several barrels of wine are produced each season specialized winemaking equipment a large work space and storage space for both bulk wine containers and bottled wine will be needed 
facilities 
winemaking requires two general types of work space and each type has different requirements a crush area is needed to receive and process the grapes and a cellar area where the wines are fermented aged and bottled is necessary in addition some general storage space is also needed to store winemaking equipment and supplies a separate area set aside for each specific function is the ideal arrangement however most winemakers have limited space available for winemaking so compromises are often necessary 
experience shows that careful planning and a few minor modifications can greatly increase the efficiency of any winemaking work space for example a large fraction of the labor in any winery is used to clean and sanitize the equipment and the work space sanitation is an ongoing effort in all winemaking areas and cleaning operations are repeated often much time and effort can be saved by arranging the work area in a way that optimizes the various cleaning procedures 
crush area 
crushing and pressing operations at any winery involve handling large quantities of materials grapes must be moved into the crush area and pomace must be removed from the crush area consequently most commercial wineries prefer to have their crush operations outside the main facility to simplify handling the large quantities of bulk materials 
many home winemakers use their garages as temporary crush areas each season the crusher is setup near the front of the garage and the grapes are unloaded from trucks or vans parked in the driveway 
washing down the crusher and the press is always necessary before any fruit can be processed then both pieces of equipment must be washed again when the operation has been completed a heavy duty hose with an adjustable spray nozzle permanently installed at the crush pad is a great convenience provide a hook or other arrangement so the hose can be hung in a convenient place cleaning a small crusher or press will generate large amounts of waste water so water disposal can be a problem most commercial crush pads consist of a smooth finished concrete pad that incorporates a large drain home winemakers often use their garages or driveways as crush areas 
pomace should be removed from the crush area promptly even sweet pomace will sour quickly on a hot day and it will attract fruit flies ants can become a terrible problem and the entire crush area should be carefully washed to remove all traces of sugar when the crush operations are finished 
cellar space 
white wines are fermented clarified stabilized aged and bottled in the cellar red wine is often fermented in open containers placed outside the cellar area cellar activities can generate a significant amount of lees and some way of disposing of liquid waste material is needed in the cellar a good solution to the disposal problem is a conveniently located sewer drain a water faucet a dedicated hose and a spray nozzle a centrally located floor drain equipped with a large grate is a great convenience 
aging wine is mostly a passive operation and it requires little more space than is necessary to hold the storage containers five gallon water bottles are about 10 inches in diameter and 20 inches high fifteen gallon stainless steel beer kegs are roughly 15 inches in diameter and 23 inches high 200 liter oak barrels are about 24 inches in diameter and 36 inches long a popular 160 gallon polyethylene storage tank manufactured by norwesco is 31 inches in diameter and 55 inches high double stacking or even triple stacking barrels is possible nevertheless most winemakers find stacked barrels difficult to handle and clean 
bottling wine requires a moderate amount of cellar space a typical bottling setup for an advanced home winemaker or a very small commercial winery might consist of a small transfer pump a filter a bottle rinser a bottle filler a corker a labeling rack and a label paster a large table or bench would be necessary to hold the empty bottles the bottle rinser the filler and the full bottles in addition a second table or a small bench would be needed to hold the label pasting machine and the rack used to hold the bottles while the labels are applied 
equipment 
large wineries use a great deal of equipment in their winemaking operations but small wineries and home winemakers frequently make due with a minimum of equipment basic crush equipment consists of a crusher and a press the key pieces of cellar equipment are wine storage containers pumps filters bottling equipment and test equipment several pieces of common winemaking equipment are briefly discussed below 
crusher 
a hand crank crusher is probably the most practical method of crushing for the average home winemaker both single and double roller crushers work well however some crusher designs are easy to crank and some are not operation of these little crushers is quite simple the crusher is placed on top of a suitable container the hopper is filled with fruit and the crank is turned clusters of grapes pass through the rollers and the crushed fruit and stems drop into the container having some way of clamping the crusher on the container is very desirable if the crusher slides or moves around it will be more difficult to crank 
stems can be easily removed by hand using the following technique put a clean plastic milk crate on top of a suitable container place a few pounds of crushed fruit in the bottom of the milk crate and make a scrubbing motion with the hand the crushed fruit will drop through the crate into the container discard the stems from the crate and repeat the process several hundred pounds of grapes can be destemmed using this method 
a power crusher/stemmer will crush and separate the grapes from the stems in one fast simple operation the grapes are dumped in the fruit hopper and the machine does the rest power crushers have capacities ranging from about 1 ton to more than 50 tons of grapes per hour even the smallest machine will keep one person busy filling the hopper unfortunately power crushers are expensive the smallest machines cost several hundred dollars crusher/stemmers are an overkill for most home winemakers but they can save a tremendous amount of labor if a winemaker produces several barrels of wine each year 
press 
most home winemakers use a vertical basket press of some kind these presses are made in a wide range of sizes and in several different styles smaller presses can handle 10 to 20 pounds and large presses hold several tons of grapes in each load smaller presses use a screw mechanism to generate the pressure large basket presses often use hydraulic cylinders and electric pumps to generate the pressure some homemade presses use a hydraulic automobile jack to produce the pressure two manufacturers are producing vertical basket presses specifically for home winemakers that use an inflatable rubber bladder to squeeze the grapes 
although small vertical basket presses are relatively inexpensive they can produce high quality juice when used properly the major disadvantage of any vertical press is the large amount of labor required to crumble the pomace cake the press must be completely disassembled and the basket removed after the cake has been broken up the basket must be reassembled and refilled to start a new press cycle several press cycles are usually required to produce dry pomace so much labor is required 
some compound basket presses can produce very high pressures high press pressures can extract the juice with a minimum amount of labor however high pressures can also extract excessive amounts of phenolic materials and produce harsh bitter wines so these presses must be used with care 
during the 1950 s many california wineries replaced their vertical hydraulic presses with horizontal presses manufactured by willmes vaslin or other manufacturers horizontal presses offer a major advantage because the pomace cake can be crumbled automatically by releasing the pressure and rotating the horizontal basket horizontal presses are simple and easy to operate and they save wineries a tremendous amount of labor the vaslin presses were made with fiberglass baskets and covers so they were much less expensive to produce than presses constructed of stainless steel although horizontal screw presses are no longer manufactured many small wineries continue to use one two and six ton vaslin presses 
modern commercial wine presses are controlled by computers and they can be programmed to execute very complicated press schedules automatically modern presses use an inflatable bag tube or membrane after the press is loaded the membrane is inflated and gently squeezes the grapes against the basket to extract the juice these new presses are nearly self operating and they only require attention when the press is being loaded or unloaded 
bottle filler 
filling wine bottles with a piece of hose is easy the hose is inserted into the wine container and the wine is siphoned into the bottles however reducing wine oxidation is always desirable so wine bottles should always be filled from the bottom with a minimum of splashing and bubbling wand type bottle fillers are a great improvement over a piece of hose a simple wand filler consists of a 16 inch length of rigid plastic tubing fitted with a small plastic valve at the bottom end attached to the end of a siphon tube when the wand is inserted in the empty bottle the valve presses against the bottom of the bottle and the wine starts to flow wine flow automatically stops when the operator raises the tube small diameter fillers often generate excessive amounts of foam so inch diameter wand type fillers are generally preferred 
several styles of gravity type bottle fillers are available these fillers have a small tank to hold the wine and two or more siphon tubes to transfer the wine into the bottles a float valve mechanism is used to keep the tank full operation of small multi spout gravity type fillers is simple an empty wine bottle is placed on a spout the machine fills the bottle to a preset level and automatically stops two three four and six spout machines are common but gravity bottle fillers as large as 24 spouts are produced two three and four spout fillers are suitable for home winemakers producing 50 or more gallons of wine each year large gravity fillers are used by smaller commercial wineries many gravity type fillers will fill at a rate of about two bottles per spout per minute one person is kept quite busy removing and replacing bottles 
larger wineries use automatic vacuum type bottle fillers these large multiple spout fillers are often integrated into a complete high speed bottling line empty bottles are sparged with nitrogen gas filled with wine corked under a vacuum and capsules and labels are applied completely packaged wine comes off the bottling line and much of the work is done automatically older bottling lines often run at rates of 10 to 40 bottles per minute and older equipment requires the constant attention of several winery employees modern bottling equipment runs at rates of 30 to 200 bottles per minute and these high speed lines only require one or two people for efficient operation modern high speed bottling equipment has reduced winery labor costs significantly however these machines are extremely complicated and very expensive 
transfer pump 
pumps are used in wineries to move must lees juice and wine wine contains significant amounts of acid so any pump used for wine must be made of corrosion resistant materials a variety of pump styles are produced to meet the requirements of different winery applications transfer pumps are used to transfer juice or wine for filtering and for bottling most transfer pumps are either rubber impeller jabsco style pumps or centrifugal pumps rubber impeller pumps are generally preferred for moderate flow rate applications when the pressure heads are higher centrifugal pumps are generally preferred when large flow rates against moderate pressure heads are needed 
home winemakers use a variety of small pumps capacities range from three to ten gallons per minute a typical rubber impeller pump can deliver five gallons per minute and it has a maximum pressure head of 30 pounds per square inch many of these little rubber impeller pumps are self priming inexpensive and provide good performance they should not be run dry for extended periods and their shaft seals have a limited service life a leaky pump with a worn shaft seal will quickly oxidize the wine so shaft seals on small pumps must be replaced often these pumps sell for about 100 
small magnetically coupled centrifugal pumps are quite suitable for general use in any small winery a magnetically coupled centrifugal pump does not have a shaft seal because the impeller shaft does not penetrate the pump housing the impeller is coupled to the drive motor by means of two powerful permanent magnets magnetically coupled pumps have advantages and disadvantages they are more expensive than direct coupled pumps they are not self priming and sometimes getting these pumps started is difficult on the other hand magnetically coupled pumps have long trouble free lives and they do not have shaft seals to leak air and oxidize the wine 
corker 
hand corking machines are made in a variety of styles and prices range from a couple of dollars to several hundred dollars an effective corking machine must be able to do two functions and these two functions must be separately the cork must be compressed first and then the cork must be driven into the bottle a good hand corker can drive dry corks without excessive effort well designed floor model corkers sell for about 100 1995 the better machines are solidly built and have a useful life greater than 100 000 corks some small inexpensive corking machines sold at home winemaking shops are practically worthless 
storage containers 
cooperage is the general term used for all kinds of bulk wine storage containers open containers with straight sides are called vats closed wine storage vessels with straight sides are called tanks curved sided containers with a bulge in the center like the familiar barrel are called casks casks range in size from 100 to more than 1000 gallons depending upon size and proportions casks are called butts pipes puncheons ovals etc 
the traditional wood used to make wine containers is white oak however in california redwood was extensively used for constructing wine containers from about 1840 to 1950 very large wine tanks have been fabricated from reinforced concrete and concrete storage containers were widely used in wineries from the early 1900 s until about 1950 a large bank of concrete tanks could still be seen at the old galleano winery in mira loma ca in 1997 in recent years stainless steel has become the material of choice for wine tanks and several manufacturers are now producing smaller size tanks from high density polyethylene 
open fermenters 
some small commercial wineries and most home winemakers use open containers for fermenting red wine large amounts of carbon dioxide gas are generated during fermentation and the wine becomes saturated with carbon dioxide the constant evolution of gas prevents air from entering the wine so oxidation is not a problem when fermentation is complete carbon dioxide gas is no longer produced and the wine must then be stored in sealed containers to protect it from oxygen in the air 
open fermenters range in size from 5 to 5000 gallons small wineries seldom use open fermenters larger than a few hundred gallons because it is very difficult to punch down the cap in a large vat by hand stainless steel wood and polyethylene are the most suitable construction materials for red fermenters small wineries often use polyethylene half ton fruit bins as temporary red fermenters each crush season a 55 gallon polyethylene drum makes a good open fermenter when the top is removed thirty gallon food grade polyethylene containers with tight fitting lids are available at most home winemaking shops much homemade red wine is fermented in 32 gallon plastic trash cans each year 
closed containers 
white and blush wines are always fermented in closed containers and most commercial wineries ferment their red wines in closed tanks when closed containers are used the large volumes of carbon dioxide gas produced during fermentation must be vented so winemakers seal closed tanks with fermentation locks until all signs of fermentation have stopped fermentation locks come in several sizes and styles most small fermentation locks contain a liquid trap of some sort the trap lets the carbon dioxide gas escape while preventing air from entering the tank 
five gallon water bottles are readily available and they are popular wine storage containers water bottles are the containers most often used by beginning home winemakers they have both advantages and disadvantages glass is a smooth vitreous material it can be cleaned easily and glass can be completely sterilized glass is transparent so fermentation progress is easy to monitor visually 
five gallon water bottles are generally too small for serious winemaking because of the oxidation problem however a few water bottles are handy for storing leftovers glass containers are heavy and some winemakers find it difficult to move a full carboy glass is both slick and fragile handling heavy glass bottles with wet hands can be quite dangerous another negative factor is the high cost of glass in 1997 the price of a new glass water bottle was about 15 00 that amounts to 3 00 per gallon 
polyethylene has become a recognized food grade material and polyethylene drums are widely used for shipping liquid food products wine can be safely stored for extended periods in heavy walled containers made of dense polyethylene and several firms are now producing polyethylene tanks in a variety of standard sizes and shapes specifically for use as wine storage containers 
used poly drums are available in 20 30 40 and 55 gallon sizes and they make excellent wine storage containers wine storage containers made of dense polyethylene have advantages and disadvantages they are light weight so polyethylene drums can be handled and stored easily best of all they are inexpensive 
new poly drums sell for about 1 00 per gallon and good used drums are often available for a few dollars each however polyethylene has a porous micro structure and it is a difficult material to clean completely 
 used polyethylene drums can retain odors for extremely long times some odors can contaminate wine so secondhand drums must be selected with care this odor problem is the major disadvantage of using used polyethylene containers for storing wine 
most winemakers agree that stainless steel is the best material for fabricating large wine storage tanks a polished food grade surface made of stainless steel is easy to clean and sterilize properly designed stainless tanks are inert and they are completely tight unfortunately stainless steel is an expensive material 
 the cost of a large size tank 10 000 gallons is two or three dollars a gallon smaller size tanks 500 gallons cost several dollars a gallon nevertheless stainless steel tanks give many years of trouble free service and when properly maintained they last almost indefinitely home winemakers often use surplus stainless beer kegs for wine storage containers the deposit for a 15 gallon beer keg is about 15 fifteen dollars is a dollar per gallon of storage capacity and finding a less expensive wine container is difficult 
barrels 
oak barrels have been used for storing wine for hundreds of years standard wine barrels come in two sizes 200 liters 52 gals and 225 liters 59 gals oak wood imparts a spicy vanillin flavor that is desirable in most red wines and this oak character is obtained by storing wine in oak barrels for an extended time after a barrel is four or five years old it no longer produces the desirable flavors and wineries must replace their barrels from time to time a few wineries replace all of their barrels each year but most wineries replace 20 to 30 percent of their barrels each year in 1997 new french barrels cost about 600 each and american barrels cost about 200 obviously the annual barrel replacement is a considerable expense when wineries use many barrels in their wine aging program 
besides their high cost oak barrels have several other disadvantages barrels are heavy difficult to handle and hard to clean an empty barrel weighs almost 100 pounds and a barrel full of wine weighs about 600 pounds with a little practice empty barrels can be moved by hand without much difficulty however this is not so with a full barrel and moving a barrel full of wine more than a short distance by hand is seldom feasible wineries place full barrels on pallets and then the pallets are moved with a fork lift oak barrels are prone to attack by wood borers unless the wood is treated with a special preservative barrels are difficult to stack by hand even when specially built racks are used eventually any oak barrel will leak 
oak chips can be added to wine to impart desirable oak flavors and many wineries use oak chips to flavor their lesser quality wines because of the high cost of new barrels some winemakers put the oak chips in a nylon mesh bag and then suspend the bag in the wine other winemakers just add the chips directly to the wine after a few days the loose chips sink to the bottom of the container and then the chips are treated just like lees estimating the quantity of chips to be added is difficult for the inexperienced winemaker the amount needed will depend upon the specific wine and on personal preference ten or twelve ounces of chips for 50 gallons of red wine is a reasonable place to start considerably fewer chips are appropriate for most white wines all wines should be tasted periodically after oak chips are added then the wine can be racked off the chips when the winemaker feels the taste is satisfactory 
barrels full of wine require little extra attention but used empty barrels are difficult to maintain when a barrel is first filled almost four gallons of wine soaks into the wood when a used barrel is left empty for a few days the wine in the wood starts turning into vinegar sterilizing oak barrels is practically impossible so when barrels become infected with vinegar bacteria they must be discarded commercial winemakers avoid this problem by not emptying their barrels until new wine is available then as the barrels are emptied they are washed with clean water and immediately refilled with new wine 
home winemakers should avoid very small oak barrels small oak barrels or casks are difficult to build and they are very expensive per gallon of capacity they are prone to leakage and small wood cooperage is more difficult to maintain properly wine stored in small oak containers becomes over oaked very quickly oak casks of five or ten gallon capacity are often recommended by home winemaking shops but these tiny barrels are little more than expensive toys 
summary 
every winery needs a crush area for processing grapes and a cellar area for fermenting aging and bottling wine a third area is needed where equipment and supplies can be stored at many home wineries a concrete driveway serves as the crush area and the garage is the cellar and storage space however daytime temperatures in typical garages are often excessive for wine storage 
little special equipment is needed to make a few gallons of wine however well designed winemaking equipment can reduce the amount of physical labor needed when larger quantities of wine are made basic crush equipment consists of a crusher and a press and basic cellar equipment includes cooperage pumps hoses filters bottling equipment and test equipment many home winemakers use new 32 gallon plastic trash cans for open red fermenters and surplus stainless steel beer kegs for wine storage containers new oak barrels can impart desirable vanillin flavor characteristics to red wines on the other hand barrels are difficult to handle in a small winery and some leakage is always encountered new oak barrels are expensive and the oak flavor disappears after the barrels have been used for a few years oak chips can be used to impart desirable oak flavors in wine and chips are inexpensive and easy to use

 materials 
various materials are added to wine throughout the winemaking process these materials are used to solve specific wine problems for example bentonite is always added to white and blush wines the bentonite removes excess protein and prevents protein from forming a haze after the wine is bottled small amounts of sulfur dioxide are added when the grapes are crushed and small additions of sulfur dioxide continue until the wine is bottled sulfur dioxide helps control the growth of microorganisms and it reduces the effects of oxidation wines fermented from apples and stone fruits often contain excessive amounts of pectin the pectin makes the wine difficult to clarify so winemakers add enzymes to break down the pectin the most common wine additives are sulfur dioxide fining agents stabilizing materials and wine preservatives 
common winemaking materials 
winemakers must use care when selecting wine additives wine is a food and any substance added during the winemaking process must be a food grade material most materials used in winemaking are also used throughout the food and beverage industries these materials are widely used and available to the winemaker as normal commercial products a few wine additives are unique to the winemaking industry and sources of a few materials may be difficult for home winemakers to find 
many winemaking materials are supplied by the manufacturer in dry granular forms these materials are usually shipped in heavy paper or plastic bags containing about 50 pounds of material with a few exceptions winemaking materials have a long shelf life many winemaking materials can be kept for several years when placed in tightly sealed containers and stored at reasonable temperatures 
home winemakers can reduce their winemaking costs by getting together and purchasing frequently used winemaking materials in commercial quantities materials purchased in small quantities often cost three or four times the bulk price so the savings can be significant reagents for wine testing and yeast and sulfites are exceptions and fresh supplies of these materials should be purchased each season the characteristics of several common winemaking materials are briefly discussed below 
anti foam 
anti foam is a clear oily liquid this is a silicone product and it has no smell or taste anti foam is used to prevent foam from overflowing containers during active fermentation about 250 milliliters of anti foam added to a 1000 gallon wine tank will reduce foaming to a minimum this material is completely inert and does not react with the wine in any way most of the anti foam added will disappear when the wine is racked even if a few drops remain they will be removed when the wine is filtered 
ascorbic acid 
ascorbic acid is vitamin c winemakers add ascorbic acid when wines contain di sulfides in larger amounts di sulfides can smell like a skunk smaller quantities give wine a rubber or garlic smell when very small quantities are present di sulfides can give wine a vague dirty odor at even lower levels di sulfides often do not produce a specific odor sometimes they are not detectable but minute quantities of di sulfides can kill the normal bouquet of a fine wine 
when ascorbic acid is added to wine it reacts with the di sulfides and the di sulfides are converted into a material called mercaptan when all of the di sulfides are converted into mercaptan the winemaker adds a very small quantity 0 05 to 0 5 milligrams per liter of copper sulfate the copper sulfate removes the mercaptan from the wine this treatment is only effective when the ascorbic acid is added to the wine several days before the copper sulfate addition 
many australian winemakers use ascorbic acid as an anti oxidant when bottling wine the ascorbic acid is used in combination with sulfur dioxide 
calcium carbonate 
sometimes grapes grown in cold climates contain too much acid then winemakers often use calcium carbonates to reduce the acid content of juice before fermentation this material is occasionally used to reduce the acid content of finished wines by small amounts however when carbonates are used to reduce the acidity of a finished wine they can change wine flavors raise ph and cause other problems grapes grown in warm climates are usually low in acid so carbonates are seldom used with warm climate fruit 
citric acid 
citric acid is one of the work horse materials in the winery and it is used for several different purposes citric acid is mixed with sulfite powder and water to prepare sulfur dioxide solutions sulfur dioxide solutions are used to sterilize winery pumps hoses filters and other winery equipment sulfur dioxide solutions are also used for wet barrel storage winemakers use weak 1 percent citric acid solutions to remove the paper taste from new filter pads stronger solutions 5 percent of citric acid are often used to sanitize bottling equipment 
sometimes citric acid is added to finished wines specifically to increase acidity and improve acid balance in small quantities it provides a fresh citric characteristic and the citric quality is often appreciated in white table wines nevertheless bench trials should always be done before making any large additions of citric acid significant additions of citric acid are seldom made to red wines the citric taste does not seem appropriate in most red wines 
about half a gram of citric acid per gallon is often added to commercial wines to improve long term stability 
diammonium phosphate dap 
diammonium phosphate is a major ingredient in many proprietary yeast foods it is added to juice or must before fermentation to supply extra nitrogen the additional nitrogen encourages rapid yeast growth and more dependable fermentations california chardonnay grapes are often deficient in nitrogen and many winemakers add dap to all chardonnay juices to help the yeast complete fermentation and not leave residual sugar in the wine 
juices lacking nitrogen can cause another problem some yeasts produce excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide when a juice lacks sufficient available nitrogen here winemakers add dap to provide extra nitrogen to reduce hydrogen sulfide formation 
fumaric acid 
in the past winemakers often added small quantities of fumaric acid to their red wines the acid prevented malolactic fermentation from occurring after the wine was bottled however since sterile filtration equipment became widely available fumaric acid is seldom used commercially many home winemakers lack filtration equipment so home winemakers continue to use fumaric acid to control ml fermentation the customary dose levels range from one to three grams of acid per gallon of wine bench testing should always be done before fumaric acid is added to wine this acid can improve the taste of some red wine but sometimes fumaric acid produces unusual or off flavors 
malic acid 
vines release malic acid by respiration throughout the ripening season when grapes are grown in hot regions little malic acid remains by harvest time and sometimes winemakers add malic acid to white wines to improve the ratio of malic and tartaric acid small additions of malic acid raise the total acidity and often give white table wines a pleasing apple like freshness 
pantothenic acid 
yeasts often produce excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide when grapes are deficient in pantothenic acid 
 consequently some winemakers add very small quantities of this material to juice or crushed grapes before starting fermentation pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased in any drug store 
pectinase pectic enzyme 
sometimes commercial wineries use enzymes to increase the amount of free run juice when crushing white grapes the enzymes break down the cells in the grape pulp and the juice is released the additional free run juice reduces the number of press loads so pressing is quicker after an enzyme treatment home winemakers using small basket presses use pectic enzymes to make white grapes easier to process pectic enzymes are also used to prevent pectin hazes from forming in wines made from fruit or from grape concentrate excessive quantities of enzymes can produce off odors and bad tastes the manufacturers directions should be followed carefully 
potassium bitartrate 
sometimes small quantities of potassium bitartrate cream of tarter are added to young wines during the cold stabilization treatment the potassium bitartrate crystals speed the precipitation of excess tartrate material from the wine the time required to stabilize the wine is shortened and winery refrigeration costs are reduced one to four pounds per 1000 gallons of wine is the normal dose 
potassium carbonate 
potassium carbonate is often used to deacidify juice and wine instead of calcium carbonate however when this material is added to wine the potassium content can be increased significantly the additional potassium can cause increases in wine ph so potassium carbonate must be used carefully 
besides increasing ph a stability problem sometimes occurs because the potassium reacts with tartaric acid in the wine potassium bitartrate is formed and unless this material is removed it can precipitate out of the wine after bottling because of this instability problem potassium carbonates should not be used after wine has been cold stabilized 
potassium caseinate 
potassium caseinate is a common wine fining material this material is used to reduce the tannin content in red wine and it is used for white wine clarification potassium caseinate is also used to remove odors and brown colors from oxidized white and blush wines sometimes this material is effective for removing excessive oak character from white wines 
when added to wine potassium caseinate reacts with wine acids and coagulates quickly fining is more successful when a caseinate water solution is injected into the wine under pressure then a very fine suspension is formed and better mixing is achieved some home winemakers mix the dry powder in water and use a large syringe to inject the solution into the wine 
potassium caseinate can strip desirable wine flavors and it can give wine a cheesy taste when excessive quantities are used normal dose levels range from 1/10 to 1/4 gram per gallon and bench trials should always be done 
potassium metabisulfite sulfite 
home winemakers use potassium metabisulfite crystals to introduce sulfur dioxide into their wines small quantities of sulfur dioxide are used to control wine microbes and sulfur dioxide also reduces wine oxidation when sulfite is added to wine it produces about half its weight in so2 about one gram of sulfur dioxide is produced when two grams of sulfite are added to the wine 
strong sulfite solutions are used to sterilize just about everything in a winery one teaspoon of sulfite powder and two teaspoons of citric acid in two gallons of water makes an effective solution for sterilizing equipment and some home winemakers use this solution to sterilize bottles just before they are filled with wine inert oak barrels can be stored full of water safely using a sulfite solution one cup of citric acid and one cup of sulfite crystals are added and then the barrel is filled with clean water 
potassium sorbate sorbate 
home winemakers use potassium sorbate to stabilize wines containing residual sugar the sorbate does not stop the yeast from fermenting the sugar but it can prevent the yeast cells from reproducing consequently sorbate is only effective when most of the active yeast cells have been removed from the wine by racking or filtering the usual procedure for using potassium sorbate is to clarify stabilize and age the wine then the wine is sweetened and the sorbate is added at bottling time potassium sorbate will not stop active fermentations 
for most people the taste threshold of sorbate is 200 or 300 milligrams per liter of wine however some people are more sensitive to the taste of sorbate and a small fraction of the population can detect less than 50 milligrams per liter fortunately for the winemaker many people sensitive to sorbate do not find its taste objectionable in wine 
the normal dose level is 200 to 250 milligrams of potassium sorbate for each liter of wine about one gram of sorbate per gallon of wine if too little sorbate is added the wine will probably start to ferment if too much sorbate is added the quality of the wine may be adversely affected dose levels of more than 250 mg/l can produce noticeable changes in wine taste and odor 
sodium bisulfite 
sodium bisulfite is an inexpensive source of sulfur dioxide for small wineries it provides the same amount of so2 as potassium metabisulfite but the sodium compound is less expensive sodium bisulfite is mixed with water and used for sterilizing winemaking equipment and for wet barrel storage since it adds sodium this material is usually not used as a source of sulfur dioxide in wine both potassium metabisulfite and sodium bisulfite are very sensitive to water and both compounds should always be stored in tightly sealed containers even when stored in sealed containers these materials can degrade rapidly and much wine has been spoiled by home winemakers using spent sulfite powder old sulfite powder should be discarded and a new supply purchased each season 
soda ash 
soda ash sodium carbonate is one of the primary cleaning agents in the winery it is used to clean and sanitize equipment tanks pumps hoses and even barrels soda ash in water produces a strong caustic solution and a soda ash solution is particularly useful for removing heavy tartrate deposits from the surfaces of wine storage containers all soda ash solutions must be carefully rinsed to remove the residue home winemakers often use soda ash to soak labels off old wine bottles 
tartaric acid 
winemakers add tartaric acid to juice or must to raise acidity and lower ph large acid adjustments should
 be made before fermentation is started an addition of four grams of tartaric acid per gallon of juice will raise the ta about 0 1 percent calculated acid additions are seldom accurate and calculated acid values should not be relied upon a small sample should be tested before making large acid additions 
care must be taken when tartaric acid is added to wine late in the winemaking process if much tartaric acid is added the wine may need to be cold stabilized again otherwise tartrate crystals may form in the bottled wine 
thiamine 
thiamine is vitamin b 1 and it is essential for healthy yeast growth winemakers often add thiamine and other vitamins to juice before starting fermentation 
trisodium phosphate tsp 
trisodium phosphate is a popular cleaning material for all types of winery surfaces this material is inexpensive effective and it washes away easily a chlorinated form of trisodium phosphate is also available and the chlorinated form is a potent sterilizing material in many commercial wineries chlorinated tsp is the material of choice for decontaminating large stainless steel wine storage tanks 
viniflora oenos 
viniflora oenos is a freeze dried culture of malolactic bacteria most ml bacteria are supplied in liquid form and several days are needed to prepare a starter viniflora oenos has gained popularity rapidly because it can be added directly to the wine in dry form to start malolactic fermentation 
yeast extract 
yeast extract is added to juice to prevent stuck fermentations by stimulating healthy yeast growth yeast extract provides additional vitamins amino acids etc it is more effective when added before fermentation is started yeast extract is a major ingredient in many proprietary yeast supplements 
summary 
winemakers add different materials to wine throughout the winemaking process these additions are made deliberately to improve color clarity stability or general wine quality each fining material can affect wine characteristics differently often one characteristic is improved at the expense of another so fining wine is usually a compromise of some kind considerable winemaking experience is needed before wine fining materials can be used effectively 
the types of material and the quantities to be used are usually determined by testing a small batch of wine and observing the results when the desired results are obtained appropriate additions are made to the main lot 
winemaking materials should be kept in tightly sealed containers and then the containers should be stored in a cool dry place with a few exceptions like yeast and sulfite most winemaking materials can be kept for several seasons and purchasing winemaking materials in bulk quantities results in significant savings 
chapter 5 

sugars and acids 
sugar molecules are formed from carbon hydrogen and oxygen and the natural grape sugars are the materials yeast converts into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide although sugars are made from only three elements some sugar molecules are very large and have complicated structures several different kinds of sugars exist and each sugar has its own name the name used to denote the entire family of sugar molecules is saccharide 
saccharide 
under certain conditions sugar molecules have a great attraction for each other and two small sugar molecules combine and form a larger molecule sometimes many small sugar molecules combine and form large complex saccharide molecules because of this attraction characteristic saccharide molecules are classified according to the number of small sugar molecules bound together 
the small simple sugar molecules are called monosaccharides and two simple sugar molecules bound together are called disaccharides three or more sugar molecules bound together into a single molecule is called a polysaccharide large polysaccharide molecules consist of thousands of small monosaccharide molecules pectin and gums are examples of large polysaccharide molecules 
monosaccharides 
the monosaccharides are called simple sugars and many different kinds of simple sugars exist each simple sugar molecule contains three four five or six carbon atoms the simple sugars are named according to the number of carbon atoms in the simple sugar molecule for example pentose sugars contain five carbon atoms and hexose sugars contain six carbon atoms winemakers are primarily interested in the two major grape sugars glucose and fructose and both are hexose monosaccharides enzymes produced by yeast convert both glucose and fructose into ethyl alcohol 
glucose is the most common simple sugar and glucose is a part of many different disaccharides and polysaccharides this is the sugar that provides energy for the human body glucose can be produced by splitting hydrolysis certain polysaccharides for example corn starch is a large polysaccharide molecule and glucose is produced commercially by hydrolyzing spitting corn starch 
fructose is found in many different kinds of fruit it is the principal sugar in honey and fructose is the sweetest tasting common sugar because it tastes sweeter than ordinary table sugar sucrose fructose is widely used and it is the sweetener of choice in the food and beverage industries fructose is sometimes called levulose 
disaccharides 
disaccharides are formed when two simple sugar molecules bind together sometimes two similar kinds of simple sugars combine often two different kinds of sugar molecules combine to form a disaccharide 
disaccharides are produced commercially by the incomplete hydrolysis of larger polysaccharides an alternate process combines two monosaccharide sugars by means of a condensation reaction to form disaccharide sugars usually disaccharide sugars must be hydrolyzed and split into their simple sugar components before they can be fermented 
maltose is a common disaccharide and it is made up of two glucose sugar molecules maltose can be produced in several different ways very large quantities of maltose are produced each year from germinated grain and then the maltose is fermented to make beer maltose is also produced by the incomplete hydrolysis of starch glycogen or dextrin 
sucrose ordinary white table sugar is found in many fruits and vegetables and it also occurs in a variety of grasses including sugar cane sucrose is a disaccharide made up of one glucose sugar and one fructose sugar this sugar is produced commercially in great quantities from both sugar cane and sugar beets sugar stored in the roots of grape vines is in the sucrose form 
microorganisms including wine yeasts produce enzymes that can hydrolyze sucrose and when sucrose hydrolyzes each sucrose molecule splits into one glucose and one fructose molecule this process produces a 50 50 mixture of glucose and fructose monosaccharides called invert sugar sucrose is a non reducing sugar and it cannot be accurately measured with clinitest tablets 
lactose milk sugar is only found in milk from mammals it is a disaccharide made up of one glucose sugar and one galactose sugar molecule lactose is easily hydrolyzed and it is the basis of many dairy products including cheese lactose is an interesting sugar because it has practically no sweet taste 
polysaccharides 
polysaccharides are large complex carbohydrate molecules containing three or more monosaccharides living organisms use polysaccharides to store energy and polysaccharides also form part of cell structural fibers starch consists of many glucose monosaccharides hooked together in both linear and branched forms pectin gums and cellulose are also large polysaccharide molecules pectin and gums are of particular interest to winemakers because wines containing small quantities of these polysaccharide materials are sometimes very difficult to clarify 
wines made from grapes infected with botrytis mold and wines made from cooked fruit often contain excessive quantities of pectin these wines are often difficult to clarify because the pectin holds spent yeast cells in suspension and the wine clears very slowly grape concentrate is made by heating grape juice and wines made from concentrate are sometimes difficult to clarify pectin rapidly clogs filter pads so filtration may not be a practical way of clarifying wines containing large quantities of pectin or gums however pectic enzymes can be effective in clarifying wines containing excessive amounts of pectin the enzymes break the pectin down into smaller more easily managed polysaccharide molecules then the wine becomes clear in a reasonable time 
wine acids 
practically all of the acids in sound wine come directly from the grapes however very small quantities of several organic acids are produced during primary fermentation and under adverse conditions bacteria in wine can produce enough acetic acid to spoil good wine in a short time in the united states titratable acid in wine is expressed in grams of acid per 100 milliliters of wine and titratable acid is calculated as if all of the different acids in the wine were tartaric acid 
the acid content of most finished table wine ranges from 0 55 to 0 85 percent the desirable acid content depends on style and how much residual sugar is left in the wine ideally the acid content of grapes should fall in the range from 0 65 to 0 85 grams per 100 milliliters percent however grapes grown in cool climates often contain too much acid and fruit grown in warm climates generally contains to little acid one of the more important winemaking tasks consists of adjusting the starting acid content of the grapes before fermentation the goal is to have just enough acid to produce a balanced wine 
practically all of the acids found in sound wines are fixed acids most of the fixed acids originate in the grape juice and these acids remain during fermentation and appear in the finished wine fixed acids are nonvolatile and nearly odorless however bacteria can produce acetic acid in wine and acetic acid is different from other wine acids acetic acid is considered a volatile acid because it evaporates easily acetic acid has a distinctive odor and it gives wine an unpleasant hot aftertaste 
acids produce hydrogen ions 
in water some acid molecules ionize and some acid molecules remain unchanged each ionized acid molecule splits into two separate pieces one piece is a hydrogen atom minus the electron and the other piece is the remainder of the acid molecule both pieces have an electric charge and both are called ions a positive electric charge is carried by the hydrogen ion and a negative charge is carried by the acid ion the remainder of the acid molecules the unionized molecules remains unchanged in the water solution 
both tartaric and malic acids have two hydrogens that can ionize and these two hydrogens h are shown in figure 2 
acid strength 
acids produce hydrogen ions in water solutions however the number of hydrogen ions produced can be large or small the number of hydrogen ions depends on how much acid is present in the solution and the number also

 h 	 o h h h 
tartaric acid malic acid 
figure 2 when wine acids ionize one or both of the hydrogens shown in bold type separate from the main acid structure 
depends on the strength of the acid 
in water some acid molecules spontaneously split into positive and negative ions however many acid molecules remain unchanged the fraction of acid molecules that ionize depends upon the strength of the acid when practically all of the acid molecules ionize the acid is called a strong acid when only a few acid molecules ionize the acid is called a weak acid in other words strong acids ionize completely and weak acids only partially ionize 
only a few acids are classified as strong all of the organic acids found in wine are weak acids however some weak acids are stronger than others tartaric acid is a weak acid and about one out of every 900 tartaric acid molecules ionizes in water the other 899 molecules remain unchanged malic acid is weaker than tartaric acid only one out of every 2500 malic acid molecules ionizes in water the other 2499 malic acid molecules remain unchanged tartaric acid is about 2 7 times stronger than malic acid because tartaric acid produces 2 7 times more hydrogen ions than an equal quantity of malic acid smaller quantities of a stronger acid can produce as many hydrogen ions as larger quantities of a weaker acid tartaric acid is considered the principal wine acid it is the strongest of the wine acids and generally more tartaric acid is present in wine 
wine can be thought of as a simple water alcohol solution and acids in wine behave much the same as they 
do in any other water solution the number of hydrogen ions 
in a wine depends upon the quantity of acid the strength of 
the acids and the quantities of potassium sodium and calcium 
present in the wine acid quantity 
 type grams/liter 
kinds of acids 
tartaric 1 to 5 
the tart taste of dry table wine is produced by the total malic 1 to 4 
quantity and the kinds of acids present tartaric and malic are succinic 0 4 to 1 
the major wine acids these two acids are present when the lactic 0 1 to 0 4 
grapes are picked and they are carried over through the citric 0 04 to 0 7 
fermentation process into the finished wine wine also acetic 0 05 to 0 5 
contains small quantities of lactic citric succinic acetic and table 3 some common wine acids 
several other organic acids as shown in table 3 some of 
these acids do not exist in the grapes they are produced in 
small quantities by microorganisms throughout the winemaking 
process 

malic acid and citric acid can be metabolized easily by microorganisms in the wine tartaric acid and succinic acid are more stable biologically and they are seldom bothered by wine microbes even so under certain conditions tartaric acid can be attacked by microorganisms and when this occurs the wine is 
usually a catastrophic loss see chapter 13 
tartaric acid 
few fruits other than grapes contain significant amounts of tartaric acid one half to two thirds of the acid
content of ripe grapes is tartaric acid and it is the strongest of the grape acids tartaric acid is responsible for much of the tart taste of wine and it contributes to both the biological stability and the longevity of wine 
the amount of tartaric acid in grapes remains practically constant throughout the ripening period however the situation in wine is different the quantity of tartaric acid slowly decreases in wine by small amounts both potassium and calcium combine readily with tartaric acid and form potassium bitartrate and calcium tartrate compounds then crystals of these two materials precipitate out of the wine during fermentation these tartrate materials can continue to precipitate for a long time and aged wine usually contains about two thirds as much tartaric acid as the starting grapes because of tartrate precipitation unfortunately these acid salts of potassium and calcium precipitate very slowly at normal cellar temperatures and wine can contain excessive quantities of these materials even after many months of aging wineries use special wine treatments to speed up tartrate precipitation cooling the wine is the most commonly used procedure just cooling the wine to about 27 degrees causes excess potassium salts to precipitate out in a few days 
tartaric acid is resistant to decomposition and it is seldom attacked by wine microbes this is why winemakers add tartaric acid to grapes deficient in acidity rather than using a less stable acid such as malic or citric most winemakers prefer the titratable acid to be about 0 7 percent for white grapes and about 
0 8 percent is preferred for white juice when the titratable acid content falls below these levels winemakers often add tartaric acid to the grapes or juice before they start fermentation 
malic acid 
malic acid is prevalent in many types of fruit this acid is responsible for the tart taste of green apples malic acid is one of the biologically fragile wine acids and it is easily metabolized by several different types of wine bacteria unlike tartaric acid the malic acid content of grapes decreases throughout the ripening process and grapes are grown in hot climates contain little malic acid by harvest time 
grapes grown in cool regions often contain too much acid high acidity results in excessively tart wines so the winemaker has a problem during alcoholic fermentation some malic acid is metabolized and the malic acid content of the wine decreases about 15 percent malolactic fermentation ml can further reduce wine acidity when wine goes through malolactic fermentation bacteria convert the malic acid into lactic acid lactic acid is milder than malic acid and ml fermentation is a standard procedure used to reduce the acidity of wines made from grapes grown in cool regions 
when grapes are grown in warm areas like southern california the winemaking situation is much different in warm regions the grapes are usually deficient in acid and removing malic acid by means of ml fermentation may not be a good idea now the problem becomes more complicated for the winemaker malic acid is not biologically stable and when malic acid is deliberately retained to improve the acid balance of the wine special steps may be needed to prevent ml fermentation from occurring after the wine is bottled the winemaker can use a sterile filter and remove all of the bacteria from the wine before bottling or he can add small quantities of fumaric acid to the wine small additions of fumaric acid can inhibit ml fermentation and make the wine stabile 
citric acid 
only small amounts of citric acid are present in grapes only about 5 percent of the total acid is citric in sound grapes like malic acid citric acid is easily converted into other materials by wine microorganisms for example citric acid can be fermented into lactic acid and some types of lactic bacteria can ferment citric acid into acetic acid excessive amounts of acetic acid are never desirable in wine so the citric acid into acetic acid fermentation can be a serious problem this potential difficulty is why citric acid is seldom used to acidify must or juice before fermentation most winemakers consider the risk of producing excessive quantities of acetic acid too great 
the acetic acid risk is much smaller after wine has been clarified and stabilized and winemakers often increase the acid content of finished white wines by adding small amounts of citric acid citric acid imparts a citric character that enhances the taste of many white and blush wines however citric acid is seldom used in red wine the distinctive citric taste may not be appropriate for many types of red wine in addition the risk of biological instability is much greater in red wines 
home winemaking shops sell a material called acid blend acid blend contains tartaric malic and citric acids and the three acids are in roughly equal proportions acid blend is often used in making fruit wines or wines made from grape concentrates however most winemakers will not add acid blend to grapes before fermentation because the citric acid in the acid blend might be converted into acetic acid in addition the lemon like taste acid blend often imparts is not be suitable for many kinds of grape wines 
succinic acid 
succinic acid is formed by yeast and small quantities of this acid are always produced during the primary fermentation the production of succinic acid stops when alcoholic fermentation is complete the flavor of succinic acid is a complex mixture of sour salty and bitter tastes and succinic acid is responsible for the special taste characteristics all fermented beverages have in common once formed succinic acid is very stable and it is seldom affected by bacterial action 
lactic acid 
lactic acid is the principal acid found in milk grapes contain very little lactic acid all wines contain some lactic acid and some wines can contain significant quantities lactic acid in wine is formed in three different ways 1 a small amount is formed from sugar by yeast during primary fermentation 2 large amounts of lactic acid are formed from malic acid by bacteria during ml fermentation 3 both lactic and acetic acid can be produced by lactic bacteria from the sugars glycerol and even tartaric acid in the wine lactic souring is the term used to describe wine when sugar is converted into lactic acid by bacteria this type of souring is a form of gross wine spoilage lactic souring was a common winemaking problem before the use of sulfur dioxide became widespread but it is seldom a problem today 
lactic acid can exist in either a right hand or left hand form lactic acid produced by yeast occurs in the left hand form and lactic acid produced by bacteria occurs in the right hand form the right hand form of lactic acid can be distinguished from the left hand form in the laboratory very easily so winemakers have a sensitive way of monitoring bacterial activity in wine simply by measuring the two forms of lactic acid 
acetic acid 
all of the acids discussed above are fixed acids fixed acids have low vapor pressures and they do not evaporate easily when wine is boiled the fixed acids do not boil away all of the fixed acids remain in the wine container fixed acids do not have significant odors 
acetic acid is different from fixed acids acetic acid has a high vapor pressure and it is a volatile acid acetic acid evaporates very easily and has a distinctive odor when wine containing acetic acid is boiled the acetic acid quickly boils away the acetic acid disappears into the air much the same as water and alcohol 
sound grapes contain very little acetic acid just like lactic acid acetic acid in wine is formed in several different ways 1 small amounts of acetic acid are formed by the yeast during alcoholic fermentation 2 some acetic acid is always formed during ml fermentation and most of the acetic acid is formed by bacteria fermenting citric acid in the wine 3 in stuck fermentations lactic bacteria often convert residual sugar into acetic acid 4 vinegar bacteria acetobacter convert ethyl alcohol in the wine into acetic acid and in the presence of air acetobacter can produce large quantities of acetic acid 
the conversion of ethyl alcohol into acetic acid by vinegar bacteria is different from the other fermentation mechanisms discussed here vinegar formation is an oxidation process and large quantities of acetic acid cannot be produced unless the bacteria have access to large quantities of air wine is not converted into vinegar when air is excluded and this is why novice winemakers are cautioned to keep their wine containers completely filled and tightly sealed 
acid salts 
acids in juice or wine occur in two forms some acid exists in a free form and some acid combines with minerals to form acid salts the acid salts of potassium sodium and calcium are always prevalent in wine and these acid salts are not stable potassium and calcium tartrates can precipitate out of the wine after a long time in particular potassium bitartrate can precipitate after the wine is bottled unless the winemaker specifically removes this material when the tartrate precipitates out of the wine crystals are formed in the bottle the potassium bitartrate crystals are harmless cream of tarter but the deposits can cause unsightly hazes in the wine sometimes large crystals are formed in the bottle and the tartrate crystals are mistaken for glass particles by the consumer producing wines with such gross visual flaws is not good for business and commercial wineries avoid these difficult public relation problems by cold stabilizing all their white and blush wines the cold stabilization process removes the excess potassium bitartrate material 
summary 
grape sugars consist mostly of two monosaccharides glucose and fructose and these two simple sugars occur in about equal proportions simple sugar molecules can combine and form larger sugar molecules called disaccharides and polysaccharides both glucose and fructose can be readily fermented but most disaccharides and polysaccharides must be split into their smaller simple sugar components before they can be readily converted into alcohol many large sugar molecules can be hydrolyzed and broken into smaller molecules by enzymes acids or heat 
when sucrose table sugar is added to wine it often produces strange flavors because many weeks may be required before the wine acids can hydrolyze all of the sucrose into glucose and fructose even in a warm cellar the strange flavors can persist for several weeks however when all of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose the strange flavor completely disappears and the wine has a normal taste 
organic acids produce the tart taste in table wines winemakers working with grapes grown in cold climates often encourage malolactic fermentation to reduce the acid content of their wines winemakers working with grapes grown in warm climates often add tartaric acid to the juice to increase the acid content of the finished wine in either case the winemaker is striving for just the right amount of acid to achieve a balanced wine 
sometimes winemakers prefer to retain as much malic acid as possible in the wine so they deliberately discourage ml fermentation however red wine is not biologically stable when malic acid is retained and then the winemaker must take special precautions professional winemakers put wine containing malic acid through a sterile filter and remove the bacteria when the wine is bottled home winemakers prevent ml fermentation in the bottle by adding small amounts of fumaric acid 
potassium bitartrate can precipitate out of wine very slowly and unsightly bottle deposits are often formed when tartrates precipitate after the wine is bottled consequently winemakers always use a cold stabilization procedure to remove excess tartrate materials from white and blush wines before these wines are bottled 
chapter 6 
ph and sulfur dioxide 
winemakers are always concerned with titratable acid ta and ph because both parameters influence wine characteristics as discussed in the previous chapter titratable acid is primarily responsible for the tart taste of table wines but ph has little relationship on the tart taste however ph strongly affects several other important wine properties including color oxidation biological and chemical stability etc although ph depends on the total acid content other factors like potassium content influence ph and because of these other factors ph is not directly related to titratable acid nevertheless wine ph is a fundamental parameter ph has a profound influence on the biological and chemical effectiveness of sulfur dioxide in wine 
ph 
chemists use the ph scale to describe the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution ph uses an upside down logarithmic scale and because of the upside down scale a smaller ph value represents more hydrogen ions for example a wine with a ph value of 3 0 contains ten times more hydrogen ions than in a wine with a ph of 4 0 consequently the ph value of a solution becomes smaller as the acid content of the solution becomes larger sometimes novice winemakers are confused by the upside down scale 
ph can be measured by several different methods but a ph meter with three digit accuracy is the most practical way of measuring wine ph 
factors affecting wine ph 
ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution consequently the ph value reflects the quantity of acids present the strength of the acids and the effects of minerals and other materials in the wine many different factors are involved but wine ph depends upon three major factors 1 the total amount of acid present 2 the ratio of malic acid to tartaric acid and 3 the quantity of potassium present 
 these three factors are discussed below 
 1 
 wine acids produce hydrogen ions and ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a solution overall wine ph will be lower when the titratable acid is higher however high titratable acid does not always produce low ph values the presence of potassium and several other factors alter wine ph malic acid is weaker than tartaric acid so wines unusually high in malic acid can have a high ta and a high ph value high acid high ph wines require special treatment using an ion exchange technique however ion exchange equipment is very expensive so most small producers have difficulties handling high 

acid high ph wines 

 2 
 tartaric acid produces almost three times more hydrogen ions than malic acid so gram for gram tartaric acid produces a much lower ph than malic acid therefore when the total acid content is fixed ph depends upon the relative amounts of tartaric and malic acid in the juice or wine for example a wine containing an unusually large amount of malic acid might have a titratable acid of 0 65 percent and a ph of 


3 9 a second wine containing more tartaric and less malic acid might have a titratable acid of 0 65 percent but the ph might be 3 4 wine ph increases as the relative amount of malic acid increases 
 3 potassium k is essential for vine growth and fruit production potassium is a mineral and vines obtain potassium through their roots the roots remove potassium from the soil and the potassium is distributed to all parts of the vine early in the season when the growth rate is high much of the potassium accumulates in the leaves then the potassium ions are moved from the leaves into the berries later in the season when the fruit starts to ripen 
potassium ions carry a positive electrical charge just like hydrogen ions under certain conditions potassium ions can change places with the hydrogen ions at the extreme ends of the tartaric acid molecules 
 these are the hydrogens that ionize easily in water solutions and these are the hydrogens shown in bold type in figure 2 potassium bitartrate is formed when potassium is exchanged for hydrogen and the hydrogen then becomes a free ion in the solution tartaric acid has two hydrogen atoms that can ionize one of the hydrogen atoms ionizes relatively easily so tartaric acid is the strongest of the primary wine acids on the other hand potassium bitartrate only has one ionizable hydrogen atom and it does not ionize so easily therefore potassium bitartrate produces fewer hydrogen ions than tartaric acid 
grapes contain from one half to three grams of potassium per liter of juice grape skins contain about nine grams of potassium per liter so grape skins contain four or five times more potassium than the juice when grape juice and skins remain in contact for extended periods potassium leaches out of the skins into the juice the additional potassium from the skins reacts with tartaric acid in the juice and forms potassium bitartrate when alcohol accumulates during fermentation the juice cannot hold all the additional potassium bitartrate and some tartrates precipitate out of the liquid red wines usually have a lower titratable acid content and higher ph values than white or blush wines because of the extended skin contact time 
significant amounts of potassium bitartrate can also precipitate as the wine is bulk aged when potassium bitartrate precipitates the titratable acid of wine decreases but wine ph may increase decrease or stay the same if the starting ph of the wine is 3 6 or less the ph will become smaller as the bitartrate precipitates out of the wine if the starting ph is 3 8 or greater the ph will become larger as the bitartrate precipitates little change will occur when the starting ph falls between about 3 6 and 3 8 
advantages of low ph 
over the range of 3 0 to 4 0 ph has little influence on wine taste titratable acid is primary factor determining the tart taste of table wines however ph strongly influences other important wine characteristics the ph values range from about 2 9 to 4 2for most wines and this may seem like a small range however the ph scale is logarithmic and a ph change of 0 3 represents a change in hydrogen ion content of about 2 times 
the chemical stability and the biological stability are both very sensitive to the ph value of the wine and that winemakers prefer to have wine ph values between 3 0 and 3 5 chemical and biological stability are improved so much at these lower ph values most winemakers believe ph is the more important wine acidity parameter wine yeasts are quite tolerant of ph yeast growth does not change significantly over the normal range of wine ph values and overall fermentation characteristics are little affected by ph on the other hand wine bacteria do not tolerate low ph values and wine ph strongly influences both bacterial growth rate and bacterial fermentation characteristics this is why malolactic fermentation is not likely to occur in wines with ph values lower than 3 3 bacterial activity is reduced in low ph wines and many of the disastrous bacterial problems discussed in chapter 13 are insignificant when wine ph is low 
a variety of chemical reactions take place in wine and many of these reactions are affected by the total number of hydrogen ions present for example wine ph has a direct influence on the hot stability of wine under warm storage conditions protein precipitates out of white and blush wine and serious haze and sediment problems occur when protein precipitates after the wine is bottled consequently white and blush wines are always treated with bentonite to remove excess protein here ph is an important consideration because bentonite is more effective in removing protein when wine ph is low as the wine ph increases bentonite becomes less and less effective and more bentonite must be used to remove the protein excessive amounts of bentonite can strip wines of desirable aromas and flavors so adding more bentonite is not desirable 
sauvignon blanc grapes often contain large amounts of protein and sauvignon blanc wines with high ph values can be difficult to stabilize completely sometimes little varietal aromas remain in these wines when enough bentonite is used to remove the excess protein however wines with low ph values seldom have this problem 
wines with low ph values generally have better visual qualities at low ph values red wines show more color and the color is better color intensity increases and the red color becomes more purple at low ph values both red and white wines have better color stability when the ph is low some important polymeric reactions are accelerated at low ph values and much of the unstable color pigments precipitate out of the wine early in the winemaking process after the unstable pigments are gone wine colors are more stable table 4 shows how several important wine characteristics are affected by ph 
sulfur dioxide 
sulfur dioxide is a yellow gas formed from one sulfur and two oxygen atoms so2 it is foul smelling and noxious the distinctive smell left by a burnt match comes from sulfur in the match reacting with oxygen in the air and producing sulfur dioxide sulfur dioxide gas reacts with water and forms sulfurous acid then sulfurous acid can be further oxidized into highly corrosive sulfuric acid sulfur dioxide is a rather nasty material but practically all winemakers add small quantities of sulfur dioxide to their wines 
benefits 
sulfur dioxide has several desirable attributes when added to wine in very small quantities enzymes in the grapes that cause browning are deactivated by sulfur dioxide sulfur dioxide helps protect wine from excessive oxidation sulfur dioxide can reduce the oxidized smell of old wine by reacting with acetaldehyde sulfur dioxide is very useful in controlling the growth of bacteria and yeast man has been adding sulfur dioxide to wine for more than a thousand years a large body of knowledge exists on the use of sulfur dioxide in wine and in many other food products the benefits of using sulfur dioxide in wine are well documented and its positive effects are indisputable several characteristics of sulfur dioxide in wine are briefly discussed below 
deactivates enzymes 
wine low ph high ph characteristic 3 0 3 4 3 6 4 0 
oxidation less more 
amount of color more 
less 
kind of color ruby more brown 
yeast fermentation unaffected unaffected 
protein stability more stable less stable 
bacterial growth less more 
bacterial fermentation less more 
so2 activity more less 

table 4 wines with low ph values have many advantages 
grape juice is in contact with the surrounding air during the crushing and pressing operations and the juice reacts with oxygen in the air and becomes oxidized oxidation causes the juice to darken and the juice gradually turns brown browning is greatly accelerated by the presence of naturally occurring enzymes in the grapes polyphenoloxidase is the name of the this enzyme and it is the same enzyme that causes freshly cut apples to turn an unpleasant brown color some grape varieties brown easily while other grape varieties have little browning tendencies the differences in susceptibility can be accounted for by the amount of polyphenoloxidase enzyme that occurs in different grape varieties enzymes responsible for browning are very sensitive to free sulfur dioxide and the enzymes are deactivated when sulfur dioxide is added to the juice the quantity of sulfur dioxide needed is very small so sulfur dioxide is a powerful tool for reducing enzymatic browning in white and blush wines 
inhibits oxidation 
the great french scientist pasteur observed oxygen is the ardent enemy of wine air is always present and oxygen in the air is always ready to react with unprotected juice or wine grape juice and wine contain a variety of materials and many of these substances are adversely affected by oxidation unpleasant bitter off odors and off tastes can be produced when these materials oxidize of course wine components are subjected to small amounts of oxygen throughout the lengthy winemaking process many of the desirable changes that take place during bulk aging are oxidation reactions so oxidation does not necessarily produce adverse changes when small amounts of oxygen are introduced very slowly however wine quality is reduced quickly when oxidation becomes excessive 
when small quantities of sulfur dioxide are added to grapes or wine roughly half the amount added quickly combines with other wine constituents the uncombined half remains in the wine in a free state only the uncombined or free sulfur dioxide is effective in the free state the sulfur dioxide reacts quickly and combines with any oxygen before any of the other wine constituents become oxidized sulfur dioxide is one
pounds sulfite of fruit grams 
of the most effective methods available for controlling oxidation and most winemakers add enough sulfur dioxide when the grapes are crushed to give 30 to 50 milligrams of so2 per liter the recommended amount of sulfite powder is shown in table 5 twice as much sulfur dioxide is sometimes used when the grapes are very warm or when they contain rot this initial dose of so2 deactivates the browning enzymes and helps prevent oxidation during crushing and pressing considerable oxidation takes place when wine is bottled and oxidation at this time can be very detrimental newly bottled wine will be short lived unless adequate sulfur dioxide is present and winemakers raise the free sulfur dioxide content of their wines to about 30 milligrams per liter just before bottling 
removes oxidized smell 
acetaldehyde is the material responsible for the characteristic smell of sherry wines and acetaldehyde can be thought of as oxidized ethyl alcohol although desirable in sherry this distinctive odor is not desirable in table wines acetaldehyde is produce when wine oxidizes and too much acetaldehyde is one of the more common defects in homemade table wines

table 5 recommended initial sulfite additions 
acetaldehyde is an intermediate product when sugar is converted into alcohol and practically all of the free sulfur dioxide disappears during fermentation by combining with acetaldehyde since very little free sulfur dioxide remains in the wine additional sulfur dioxide must be added when fermentation is finished the recommended practice is to add enough sulfur dioxide to combine with any remaining acetaldehyde and leave 20 to 30 milligrams of so2 per liter of wine most winemakers routinely add about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to newly completed fermentations then about 30 milligrams per liter of free so2 is maintained in the wine during the lengthy clarification stabilization and aging period 
inhibits bacteria and yeasts 
the initial dose of 30 to 50 milligrams per liter of so2 added at the crusher also provides the winemaker an effective way of controlling fermentation most commercially prepared wine yeasts have considerable tolerance for sulfur dioxide but the activity of wild yeast is greatly diminished by small amounts of so2 when small quantities of sulfur dioxide and commercial wine yeast are used to start fermentation the inoculated yeasts multiply quickly and the commercial yeasts dominate the wild yeasts throughout the fermentation period 
small quantities of sulfur dioxide can eliminate many undesirable bacteria when used at reasonable concentrations so2 helps control vinegar bacteria and protection against vinegar bacteria is very important in all wineries sulfur dioxide can also inhibit malolactic bacterial activity so winemakers use so2to help control malolactic fermentation sulfur dioxide can exist in wine as free sulfur dioxide or as fixed sulfur dioxide the effectiveness of sulfur dioxide in controlling wine microbes depends primarily on the form of sulfur dioxide and only free sulfur dioxide is biologically active 
 moreau and vinet studied the antiseptic properties of sulfur dioxide in wine and they concluded that molecular so2 was the effective form fornachon studied the characteristics of both fixed and free so2 in australian wines and he showed several types of wine bacteria including lactobacillus could be controlled by very small quantities of molecular sulfur dioxide several other sulfur dioxide studies have been done and they clearly show 0 5 to 1 5 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide can provide good microbial stability in both dry and sweet wines 
today most winemakers feel that 0 8 milligrams of molecular sulfur dioxide per liter of wine provides adequate protection for dry table wines consequently most commercial wineries maintain at least 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide in their wines from the completion of fermentation until the wine is bottled since molecular sulfur dioxide is the biologically effective form winemakers are always interested in how much of the sulfur dioxide in a wine exists in the molecular form 
ph and sulfur dioxide 
when sulfur dioxide is added to wine some sulfur dioxide combines with other materials in the wine and becomes fixed the remainder of the sulfur dioxide remains in a free form the free sulfur dioxide exists in three different forms the molecular form the bisulfite form and the doubly ionized sulfite form the fraction of free sulfur dioxide that exists in the molecular form is strongly dependent upon the ph of the wine since only the molecular sulfur dioxide is effective winemakers are always interested in how much of the free so2 exists in the molecular form the amount of free sulfur dioxide in a wine can be measured easily on the other hand the fraction of free sulfur dioxide that exists in the molecular form is difficult to measure fortunately the amount of molecular sulfur dioxide can be easily calculated when the free sulfur dioxide content and the ph of the wine are known 
amount of so2 needed 
the free sulfur dioxide needed to produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular so2 for different values of wine ph is shown in table 6 the free sulfur dioxide is given in milligrams per liter mg/l for example table 6 shows that 32 milligrams of free sulfur dioxide per liter of wine will produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular sulfur dioxide in a wine having a ph of 3 4 these data clearly show the amount of molecular sulfur dioxide in a wine is strongly dependent upon wine ph these data also show that acceptably small quantities of free sulfur dioxide will produce enough molecular sulfur dioxide to provide good microbial stability when wine ph is less than about 3 6 however when the ph exceeds 3 8 or so significantly large quantities of sulfur dioxide are required at high values of wine ph prohibitively large quantities of free sulfur dioxide are needed to produce 0 8 milligrams per liter of molecular so2 
summary 
titratable acid is a measure of the total quantity of all the acids in a wine and ph is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions present in a wine several factors influence wine ph wines containing little

 table 6 wine ph determines 
the quantity of free so2 needed to 
produce 0 8 mg/l of molecular 
sulfur dioxide 

acid and lots of potassium have high ph values more tartaric acid less malic acid less potassium and greater titratable acid result in smaller ph values 
low wine ph values inhibit wine bacteria but wine yeasts are not affected when wine has a low ph sugar fermentation progresses more evenly and malolactic fermentation is easier to control bentonite is more effective in removing excess protein from wines with low ph values in addition red wines with low ph values have more and better color and white wines do not brown as easily 
the situation is much different when wine ph values are high bacteria multiply rapidly in high ph wines and unwanted bacterial fermentations become more troublesome high ph wines are less biologically stable and they have poorer chemical stability red and white wines have poorer color when the ph is high wines with high ph values always require more attention and greater care than wines with low ph values 
only the molecular form of sulfur dioxide is effective against wine microbes when wine ph is low very small additions of free sulfur dioxide give winemakers an effective tool for managing wine microbes in wines with high ph values excessive quantities of sulfur dioxide are needed to control microbes effectively 
controlling microorganisms is very important so winemakers maintain 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide in their wines from the completion of the fermentations until the wine is bottled however such small quantities of free sulfur dioxide will not be adequate unless wine ph is low 
chapter 7 

winery sanitation 
winemakers are responsible for many different activities but one of his or her most important duties is to make certain the winery is maintained in a clean sanitary condition dirty cellar conditions can result in wines with strange off odors and off flavors wine acts like a sponge and it absorbs all kinds of odors many homemade wines are afflicted with off odors and off flavors and usually these problems can be attributed to a lack of cleanliness or to poor storage conditions unless strict sanitary conditions are maintained in the storage area wine quality is always at risk 
although winery sanitation is very important many beginning winemakers do not understand the methods and materials needed to establish and maintain clean sanitary winemaking conditions 
basic sanitation rules 
the basic principles of sanitation and the ways these principles are applied in the wine industry can be found in a wine institute publication by davison 1963 titled sanitation guide for wineries this document identifies the following issues as most important for maintaining basic winery sanitation 
 1 
 keep the winery clean and free of refuse both inside and outside 

 2 
 inspect the winery premises the equipment and the cooperage at least once each month and do this inspection on a regularly scheduled basis 

 3 
 keep all winery equipment clean and in good working condition equipment should be arranged in an orderly way and the work areas kept free of clutter 

 4 
use plenty of clean water sterilizing materials and cleaning agents and the entire winery should be cleaned on a regularly scheduled basis 

 5 
get rid of harmful bacteria yeast mold insects and rodents then take any measures necessary to prevent a recurrence of these pests 

although these rules may seem obvious they should not be taken for granted and every home winemaker should carefully consider just how these five rules apply to his or her particular winemaking situation 
 wash equipment just before it is used then wash everything again when the job is finished is another simple but very effective winery sanitation rule most winery residues can be easily rinsed away when wet but grape residues are very difficult to remove after they become dry cleaning dried grape muck out of a fifty foot length of transfer hose is a difficult and frustrating task the clean before and clean after rule seems to imply twice as much work however this is not so and the rule will save a tremendous amount of time and labor if it is conscientiously applied practically all large wineries practice and rigidly enforce this rule this rule is particularly important for small producers because they often do not have high pressure washers or steam cleaning equipment 
pomace 
pomace should be removed from the winery promptly and all the pomace should be disposed of in a suitable way pomace should never be allowed to accumulate near active fermentations even sweet pomace acetifies quickly in hot weather and starts turning into vinegar then the pile of pomace is sure to attract fruit flies and the flies then carry acetic acid bacteria from the pomace pile into the active fermentations 
putting pomace back into the vineyard is the preferred method of disposal when pomace is spread in a thin layer it dries quickly and becomes high quality compost material unfortunately most home winemakers do not have access to vineyards so they must find other ways to dispose of their pomace a method that works well in some urban areas is to place 20 to 30 pounds of pomace in large plastic trash bags then the bags are placed at the curb on trash collection day some wineries rent an extra trash dumpster for several weeks each crush season and this is a very convenient and effective way of disposing of pomace for small producers arrangements must be made to have the dumpster emptied promptly or the pomace will acetify and attract fruit flies 
cleaning agents 
many proprietary cleaning agents have been developed specifically for use in the wine and food industries and these materials have properties that make them particularly suitable for the intended job however sources of proprietary cleaning materials can be difficult to find many cleaning materials are supplied by the manufacturer in 50 pound bags or in large drums and such large quantities are not suitable for small producers fortunately several common household cleaning materials give reasonable performance in the small winery and these materials are readily available in small quantities at the corner market 
sanitation procedures used in the winery cannot be effective unless the proper material is used and the material must be used in the correct concentration and for a minimum amount of time in addition some sanitation materials must be applied at elevated temperatures often application time and application temperature function together some typical examples are shown in table 7

sometimes lacking 
generally any cleaning products with artificial odors should be avoided and highly perfumed liquid detergents are particularly bad strong perfumes can be difficult to rinse away from winery surfaces and microscopically porous materials like polyethylene can retain the perfume scent for a very long time unscented detergents are available but sometimes these products are difficult to find at the local market 
phosphates 
sodium phosphate is an excellent water softener and it is one of the better winery cleaning materials sodium phosphate is the principal ingredient of many automatic dishwasher powders and in this form sodium phosphate is inexpensive and readily available phosphate based detergents are often used for soaking off labels and cleaning used wine bottles 
ctsp 
chlorinated tri sodium phosphate ctsp is the work horse cleaning agent in both commercial and home wineries the best defense against contamination in small wineries is chlorinated tsp a stiff brush hot water and lots of elbow grease ctsp is readily available and it lifts dirt well the chlorine is a powerful sterilizer and in this form chlorine is easier to rinse away solutions of ctsp feel soapy or slippery when mixed at a useful strength and one to four tablespoons of ctsp in a gallon of hot water produces a useful concentration tsp can be hard on hands and rubber gloves should be worn when strong solutions are used some automatic dishwasher powders contain significant amounts of chlorinated tri sodium phosphate 
hypochlorite 
clorox sodium hypochlorite is an inexpensive and readily available source of chlorine sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in clorox this material is a powerful oxidizer and it is one of the most potent disinfectants readily available to home winemakers unfortunately clorox does not rinse away easily in cold water and clorox is particularly difficult to remove from porous materials many home winemaking books condemn this material because clorox is so potent and so difficult to rinse completely even so commercial wineries use large quantities of sodium hypochlorite because it is such an efficient sanitizer unscented clorox can be purchased at any super market it is all the same material so buy theleast expensive brand 
the following procedure is recommended when clorox is used to sterilize wine containers first the surfaces of the tank are scrubbed with a clorox solution then the surfaces are rinsed two or three times with clean water next the surfaces are rinsed with a solution consisting of one tablespoon of sulfite crystals in a gallon of water sulfur dioxide and chlorine combine quickly and the residue washes away easily finally the tank surfaces are rinsed again with clean water to remove any sulfur dioxide residue all strong cleaning products must be used with caution and full strength clorox must be handled with special care under some conditions clorox can produce poisonous chlorine gas do not breathe clorox fumes and do not get clorox on clothing 
rinse carefully 
after winemaking equipment has been scrubbed down all of the cleaning material must be removed from surfaces that can contact wine if doubt exists the surfaces should be rinsed again completely all of the cleaning agents listed above will do a better job of cleaning when they are used with hot water and these materials also rinse away more easily when hot water is used 
cleaning aids 
a good adjustable nozzle attached to a garden hose is the primary piece of cleaning equipment in most small wineries the nozzle should provide several spray patterns including a strong high velocity stream and the nozzle should not leak the hose and nozzle will be dropped from time to time so the nozzle should be of rugged construction hang the hose with the nozzle attached in a convenient spot in the crush area and many steps will be saved 
special long handled brushes are made for washing automobile hub caps and these brushes are very convenient for scrubbing small tanks containers and most winemaking equipment these long handled brushes can be purchased in the automotive departments of large stores they are inexpensive and a couple of these brushes are very handy for all kinds of cleaning jobs in any small winery 
home winemakers use an assortment of bottle brushes for cleaning stubborn residues from the inside surfaces of used wine bottles jugs and carboys these brushes have long twisted wire handles and they are manufactured in many sizes 
jet carboy washers are a great aid when washing old wine bottles this little brass gadget attaches to a water faucet or a garden hose and delivers a powerful jet of water to the inside surfaces of any bottle or jug 
 the water starts flowing when a bottle is placed in position and automatically turns the water off when the bottle is removed often little scrubbing with a bottle brush is necessary if dirty bottles are soaked for two or three days and then power rinsed with a jet carboy washer 
equipment 
proper winery sanitation includes cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces that can contact wine all winemaking equipment including the crusher and the press should be scrubbed with a ctsp solution after scrubbing 
the equipment must be carefully rinsed with lots of clean water then the equipment should be washed again with plain water immediately after use before any residue has time to dry after the second washing the equipment should be drained carefully then when the equipment is completely dry it can be safely stored away novice winemakers should try to develop a habit of washing winery equipment before and immediately after each use 
hoses and tubing 
hoses and tubing should be cleaned much the same as other pieces of winemaking equipment however scrubbing the inside surfaces is practically impossible so hoses and tubing require special care a strong ctsp solution removes soil efficiently when used promptly but the tubing should be rinsed several times with clean water to make sure no ctsp remains on the inside surfaces 
mold starts to grow in a short time if water is allowed to stand in a hose wineries hang their hoses with both ends down so any water can drain completely special hose racks for this purpose are constructed from wood plastic or metal home winemakers often make hose racks from scrap wood or from several nails appropriately placed hanging hoses from a single nail will cause permanent kinks if a length of hose or tubing becomes heavily stained or contaminated with mold try a treatment of full strength clorox 
tanks and carboys 
the clean before and clean after rule also applies to carboys and tanks two types of tank residues are often encountered and both types are difficult to remove even when the tank is cleaned promptly an ugly brown deposit often forms near the top of small fermenters and this material can be quite difficult to remove a good stiff brush and chlorinated tri sodium phosphate are recommended for this job sometimes this type of residue occurs right at the shoulder of a glass or plastic carboy and it is very difficult to reach here the handle of a large bottle brush should be bent and extra effort should be applied 
a second type of cleaning problem arises when a carboy or tank has been in use for several years and the inside surface has become coated with a heavy tartrate deposit the tartrate causes no harm if the coating is not excessively thick and if it does not contain a large quantity of trapped lees in fact a moderate tartrate coating will accelerate the cold stabilization of any new wine stored in the container 
however after several years the tartrate coating becomes thick rough and contaminated with trapped lees 
 now the tartrate coating must be removed heavy tartrate deposits are difficult to remove with cold water but they can be removed quickly with a solution made of a half cup of sodium carbonate in a gallon of hot water and a stiff bristled brush thin deposits of tartrate in small tanks or carboys can be removed easily by filling the container with plain water for twenty four hours 
used wine bottles 
cleaning and sterilizing old wine bottles is not fun nevertheless the high cost of new glass about 6 00 a case compels many home winemakers to rely on recycled wine bottles the inside surfaces of dirty wine bottles are an ideal environment for a variety of molds yeasts and bacteria and large colonies are often seen growing on the dried residue dirty used bottles are always a potential source of contamination so dirty bottles should not be stored in the winemaking area a safer procedure is to clean the bottles as they are collected then the clean bottles should be stored points down in clean cardboard cartons 
used bottles are difficult to clean properly the usual procedure is to soak the dirty bottles in water for a few days soaking loosens the dried wine residue and the inevitable mold colonies some winemakers add a half cup of tsp to the water to speed up the soaking process after soaking the bottles can be scrubbed with a bottle brush using hot water and a strong phosphate based detergent a cup of automatic dishwasher powder in two gallons of hot water makes a good bottle cleaning solution after the bottles have been thoroughly washed they should be carefully rinsed drained and dried a jet carboy washer will save time and hot water when many bottles are being washed washed bottles will remain sanitary for some time if they are placed upside down in clean cardboard cases and stored in a dry place 
barrels 
used empty barrels are difficult to maintain the first time a new barrel is filled with wine more than three gallons of wine soaks into the wood surfaces later when a barrel is stored empty the wine soaked into the wood quickly acetifies the wine in the wood turns to vinegar and the barrel becomes contaminated with vinegar bacteria some home winemaking books recommend cleaning barrels contaminated with vinegar bacteria with soda ash however sterilizing contaminated barrels is practically impossible experienced winemakers use their noses and discard barrels smelling of vinegar 
empty barrels can be safely stored for several weeks if they are gassed with sulfur dioxide and kept tightly sealed home winemakers and small commercial wineries burn sulfur wicks in their barrels large wineries purchase sulfur dioxide gas in high pressure cylinders barrels gassed with sulfur dioxide should be washed with clean water before they are filled winemakers face another serious problem when empty barrels are stored for long times after several weeks the wood in an empty barrel becomes dry and the staves start to shrink as the wood shrinks the hoops become loose and the barrel loses its shape in hot dry climates barrels often fall to pieces in a few months at best empty barrels leak badly when first filled and several days of soaking are often required before these barrels can be filled with wine 
barrels can be maintained for extended periods if they are stored wet first the barrel is washed several times with clean cold water then the barrel is half filled with clean water and a cup of sulfite powder and a cup of citric acid are added then the barrel is completely filled with water and bunged tight the sulfite/acid solution will keep the barrel in good condition for some time but after several months the sulfite/acid solution must be replaced 
unfortunately barrels stored in this way lose their oak character just as if they were filled with wine new 60 gallon french oak barrels sell for about 600 and american barrels sell for about 200 storing expensive barrels filled with water shortens the effective life of the barrels so this method is only used for older inert barrels 
commercial wineries seldom store empty barrels they keep their expensive oak cooperage full of wine when aged wine is removed for bottling the barrels are washed with clean water and immediately refilled with new wine some home winemakers also use this method to maintain their barrels in good condition however keeping barrels filled with wine requires bottling last years wine during the busy crush season so careful planning is needed 
summary 
sanitation is an important part of winemaking and good housekeeping is necessary in any winery many proprietary cleaning agents are available but most small wineries and home winemakers rely on common cleaning agents like sodium phosphate automatic dishwasher powder chlorinated tsp and clorox the wash everything just before use and again after use winemaking rule should always be practiced hoses can be maintained easily if they are washed immediately after use the wet hoses should be hung on a wall with both ends pointing down then they can drain and dry out completely the bacteria yeasts and molds that grow so profusely on the bottoms of old dirty wine bottles represent a constant source of contamination consequently dirty used wine bottles should not be stored in winemaking areas dirty bottles should be washed and sterilized and stored away in a sanitary condition 
maintaining empty oak barrels in good condition is difficult small producers burn sulfur wicks in their empty barrels large wineries fill their empty barrels with sulfur dioxide gas from high pressure cylinders experienced winemakers avoid empty barrels by immediately refilling their barrels with new wine

crush season 
crush seasons only lasts about eight weeks and wineries must pick transport and crush all the grapes needed for their annual supply of wine in that short time crush seasons are busy hectic times for winery personnel and twelve or fourteen hour workdays are quite common winemakers make many decisions during this busy period and many of these decisions must be made quickly unfortunately hastily made decisions often result in poor wine quality most commercial winemakers prepare a detailed crush plan early each season to reduce the number of these high risk decisions crush seasons are not so hectic for home winemakers nevertheless home winemakers have the same kinds of problems each year and most home winemakers also benefit from well thought out crush plans 
deciding what varieties of wine will be made is the first step in developing a crush plan then the winemaker decides how many gallons of each variety will be produced once the varieties and quantities have been established the more detailed winemaking issues such as potential sources of grapes fruit costs equipment cleaning cooperage requirements etc can be addressed 
most home winemakers have limited time during crush season and even routine chores such as repairing and cleaning equipment need to be planned well in advance crush plans should be formulated many weeks before harvest time and then the plan should be followed until all of the new wines are safely stored away in the cellar 
fruit quantity 
the quantity of wine produced from a ton of grapes is called wine yield and wine yield depends on the variety of the grapes the type of equipment available the winemaking techniques used etc professional winemakers using modern horizontal presses often get 160 or 170 gallons of quality wine from a ton of fruit home winemakers generally use small vertical basket presses and home winemakers seldom get more than 150 gallons per ton consequently most home winemakers require 13 or 14 pounds of grapes for each gallon of wine when small batches of red wine are made at home without a crusher or press wine yields will be much lower and about twenty pounds of grapes will be needed for each gallon of wine making white wine without a press is not feasible 
wine containers must be kept completely full of wine throughout the winemaking process wine stored in barrels evaporates and significant quantities of wine are lost each time wine is racked wine containers must be topped up periodically extra wine is always needed to keep the containers full so winemakers routinely produce extra wine 10 15% to use as topping material 
getting grapes from the same vineyard each season is always an advantage winemakers learn what to expect from the fruit when grapes from the same vineyard are processed year after year after a few seasons the winemaker knows what adjustments are needed and he or she can fine tune the wine easily these small adjustments are important to wine quality so winemakers prefer to work with fruit from the same vineyards each season sometimes novice home winemakers believe grapes are grapes but they learn the value of quality fruit and grape source continuity after a few harvests 
buying grapes 
wine grapes are bought and sold by the ton and higher prices are usually paid when home winemakers purchase fruit in much smaller quantities this is why many home winemakers pool together each season and purchase grapes in ton quantities grapes are hauled from the vineyard in field lugs picking boxes holding about 40 pounds half ton bins one ton tanks and in large gondolas when small quantities of fruit are purchased from a vineyard the size of the containers used can be important a serious problem can develop when a ton of fruit is needed and the grapes are coming out of the vineyard in five ton gondolas 
when grapes are purchased from an outside source the grower should be contacted early in the season grape growers like to have their grapes sold well before harvest time so purchase arrangements are best made well before the fourth of july 
the growers harvest criteria should be discussed and carefully considered some growers harvest as early as possible each season and red grapes are often picked very close to 22 5 brix trying to make a big red wine from under ripe grapes is not realistic and if the growers harvest criteria is not compatible with the style of wine planned the winemaker should look for another source of grapes who will pick and the price of the grapes should be clearly established when purchases are made from outside sources 
harvest time depends on many factors and picking times vary from year to year the grape varieties vineyard location soil weather conditions and irrigation schedules all influence harvest times rain late in the season often delays picking by a week or two many variables are involved and accurately predicting when grapes will be ripe is nearly impossible consequently winemakers should keep in touch with the vineyard and follow the development of the grapes as they ripen then the winemaker will be ready to process the grapes promptly when harvest time finally arrives 
expecting commercial growers to sell their highest quality fruit to home winemakers is not realistic commercial growers prefer to use their best quality fruit to entice large wineries into multi year contracts five seven or even ten year fruit contracts are often beneficial to both the grower and the winery practically all of the highest quality wine grapes are sold under long term contracts so home winemakers are always at a disadvantage when attempting to buy quality grapes on the open market a few home winemakers plant their own vineyards and produce estate wines simply because high quality grapes are so difficult to buy 
warm fruit 
oxidation and other changes start to occur when the grapes are picked and fruit should be loaded transported and processed quickly to minimize these changes however exceptions to the above rule are sometimes necessary when grapes are picked late in the afternoon on a hot day under these condition the grapes may be very warm hot fermentations are difficult at best so in this situation letting the fruit sit overnight and cool down may be the lesser of two evils larger wineries cool warm fruit with large refrigeration systems small wineries and home winemakers try to avoid warm fruit on harvest day small producers get to the vineyard early while the grapes are cold then they load transport and process the grapes quickly 
unfortunately home winemakers seldom have much control over when or how the grapes are picked large vineyards must cater to local wineries and grapes going to a winery are usually the first to be picked and loaded handling small quantities of grapes is often difficult for large vineyards and the grower is usually doing the home winemaker a favor therefore when a home winemaker picks up a ton of grapes he or she often has little choice and must accept warm fruit picked late in the day 
growing grapes 
many professional and amateur winemakers prefer to grow their own grapes because having complete supervision of the vineyard gives the winemaker the greatest control over grape quality most home winemakers are never able to purchase really high quality fruit so when a home winemaker is determined to make quality wines his only alternative is to plant a small vineyard when suitable space and water are available planting a few hundred vines is a practical solution to the high quality fruit dilemma and more home winemakers are becoming growers 
materials for a standard two wine trellis and a drip irrigation system range in cost from 1 000 to 4000 per acre sometimes secondhand vineyard materials can be found and the savings can be quite large vines can be grown on their own roots in areas where the phylloxera root louse is not a problem cuttings can be planted in these areas and cuttings are easier faster and less expensive to plant than rooted stock often cuttings can be obtained for nothing each year at pruning time and when cuttings are planted with reasonable care a 95 percent take can be expected 
yields 
crop yields from any vineyard depend upon the grape variety weather soil conditions water etc yields of one to two tons of grapes per acre are common in old unirrigated coastal vineyards in the central valley heavily fertilized and irrigated vineyards planted with carignane grenache or zinfandel grapes often produce twelve or more tons per acre however at these high crop levels the color is deficient the acid level low and overall fruit quality is often poor 
yields of four or five tons per acre can be expected for well grown high quality grape varieties if an acre containing 600 vines produces four tons of grapes each vine would be producing about 13 pounds of grapes thirteen pounds of grapes will make about a gallon of wine so an average vine might produce about one gallon of wine each year however one gallon of wine per vine may be too optimistic for small isolated vineyards such yields apply to large mature vineyards managed by experienced grape growers small vineyards are more difficult to manage successfully and small isolated vineyards are more susceptible to deer coyote rabbit bird bee and wasp damage home vineyards planted with cabernet or chardonnay grapes often average about two tons per acre 
getting ready 

conscientious winemakers take a complete inventory of winemaking materials and supplies and orders for needed cellar supplies are placed then all of the equipment is assembled inspected and repaired several weeks before harvest time then when each piece of equipment is in good working order all of the equipment is cleaned carefully conscientious winemakers are prepared to make wine long before the first grapes of the season are picked 
supplies 
orders for winemaking supplies should be placed several weeks before harvest time because suppliers are very busy just before and during a crush season home winemakers often get together and order winemaking supplies in commercial quantities to reduce their winemaking costs for example a 500 gram package of prise de mousse active dry yeast cost 8 50 in 1997 the cost of a 5 gram envelope of the same yeast was 0 75 so buying yeast in five gram envelopes can be expensive 
home winemakers bottling twenty or so cases 50 gallons of wine a year will need the following winemaking supplies each crush season 
tartaric and citric acid 
active dry wine yeast 
malolactic bacteria optional 
yeast nutrients di ammonium phosphate yeast hulls superfood etc 
sulfite powder 
fining materials bentonite gelatin and sparkolloid 
filter materials pads or cartridges 
laboratory test chemicals 
sanitation materials chlorinated tsp clorox etc 

equipment 
most winemakers assemble inspect and test their equipment several weeks before harvest time all machinery should be checked for rust and corrosion and motor powered equipment should be inspected for cracked belts and frayed electrical cords rusty equipment should be scraped sanded or sandblasted then the clean surfaces can be painted when all repairs are complete the equipment should be tested for proper function when everything is in good working condition the equipment should be scrubbed with a chlorinated tsp solution then the equipment should be rinsed with clean water several times and drained completely all winemaking equipment should be in good working condition clean and ready for use before the first grapes are expected 
tanks 
all empty tanks drums and other containers should be checked for leaks after any needed repairs have been made the containers should be scrubbed with a chlorinated tsp solution then the containers should be rinsed several times with clean water and drained drums carboys and other small containers can be stored away until needed in a few wineries several weeks of hectic bottling are required each crush season because the tanks are full of last years wine most winemakers do not postpone bottling and they have clean empty tanks well before the crush season 
barrels 
empty barrels should be checked for acetification or moldy smells or off odors and novice winemakers must learn to trust their noses when cleaning and testing wood cooperage sweet smelling barrels should be filled with clean water and carefully checked for leaks sometimes leaky barrels must be soaked for several days to swell the stays and stop the leaks then the barrels should be sterilized either by burning a sulfur wick or by filling the barrel with so2 gas from a high pressure cylinder barrels sterilized with sulfur dioxide can be held in good condition for several weeks if they are kept tightly bunged to retain the sulfur dioxide gas barrels stored in this way must be rinsed with clean water immediately before they are filled with wine 
 empty barrels stored for more than a few months will require extra attention 
summary 
lots of things can and do go wrong during crush and most winemakers develop detailed crush plans early each year to reduce the number of quickly made high risk decisions 
most winemaking materials keep well but sulfite powder yeast and laboratory reagents should be replaced each season orders for winemaking supplies should be placed early in the season because suppliers are very busy just before and throughout the crush season 
generally large vineyards prefer to sell their grapes early in the season and outside fruit sources should be contacted and arrangements to buy grapes should be made early 
all winemaking equipment should be inspected repaired and put in good working condition then the equipment should be scrubbed rinsed and completely drained the equipment should be ready to use long before the expected harvest time 
most winemakers try to go into the crush season with a well thought out crush plan adequate winemaking supplies clean functional equipment and empty tanks 
chapter 9 

harvest 
chardonnay and pinot noir are early ripening grape varieties and they are among the first grapes picked each year cabernet sauvignon nebbiolo and carignane are late varieties and these varieties are the last grape varieties picked in southern california the crush usually starts in mid august and ends in october harvest times vary from year to year in early years the grapes are picked two or three weeks earlier than normal in late years carignane grapes are often picked in late october the start of the grape harvest depends primarily on accumulated heat the grape harvest in northern coastal regions starts about three weeks later than in southern california for a given location most of the grapes are harvested each year during a seven or eight week period 
harvest decisions 
high quality wine can only be made from high quality grapes the quality of the grapes always determines the potential quality of the wine if the grapes are picked too early or too late wine quality will suffer wine made from under ripe grapes often has a green characteristic these wines contain excess acid lack color lack flavor intensity and lack varietal character when grapes are picked too late the wine is high in alcohol and low in acidity often wines produced from overripe fruit have stewed fruit raisin or prune flavors quality wine can only be made from high quality properly ripened fruit and deciding exactly when to pick the grapes is the most important decision a winemaker makes each crush season 
unfortunately ripe wine grapes are very perishable and grapes are at their best for just a few days in warm growing areas the short harvest interval and crop sizes of several tons per acre create serious harvest problems for winemakers coordinating harvest activities and crush operations is difficult and crush seasons are busy and sometimes hectic periods at any winery 
when to pick the grapes is such an important decision that most winemakers start sampling grapes several weeks before harvest time as harvest day approaches the winemaker goes to the vineyard every few days to sample the fruit he looks at the condition of the vines and he tests the texture of the berries by gently squeezing them between his thumb and forefinger the grapes are visually examined and tasted the pulp is smelled and the color of the seeds are examined then the winemaker collects a representative sample of several hundred berries from each vineyard when the winemaker returns to the winery he measures the titratable acid ph and sugar content of the sample grapes 
acid content 
tartaric and malic acids make up about 90 percent of the total organic acid content in grapes malic acid is found in many different varieties of fruit but only grapes contain significant amounts of tartaric acid the amounts of tartaric acid and malic acid are about equal when grapes start to change color and soften veraison and the quantity of tartaric acid remains roughly constant throughout the ripening period on the other hand the quantity of malic acid decreases as the grapes ripen and the loss of malic acid results in a gradual decrease in the total acid content during the ripening period in hot growing regions much of the malic acid is gone by harvest time depending upon the variety and the growing conditions grape juice contains 1 5 to 5 times more tartaric acid than malic acid 
in cold viticulture regions ripe grapes have an acid content ranging from 0 7 to 1 3 percent such high acidity often results in excessively tart wine to avoid excess tartness winemakers in cold growing regions use special procedures to reduce wine acidity the situation is quite different when grapes are grown in warm regions like the interior valleys of california here the acid content of ripe grapes often falls between 
0 4 and 0 8 percent grapes grown in such warm climates often have too little acidity and wine produced from grapes low in acidity is often bland and flat tasting besides producing bland wines fermenting grapes low in acidity often results in other problems and adding acid to grapes grown in warm regions is a standard winemaking practice large acid additions are best made before fermentation is started 
the acid content of grapes or wine is usually measured using a procedure called titration sometimes winemakers call the acid content total acid but the preferred term is titratable acid titration measures the sum of all the different types of acids in the wine but the results are expressed as if all of the acids were tartaric acid french winemakers use a different convention they express titratable acid as if all the acids present were sulfuric acid these different customs result in different numbers and sometimes novice winemakers are confused by the different conventions 
ph 
grape acids differ considerably in strength tartaric acid is stronger than malic acid and malic acid is stronger than citric acid a quantity called ph is used to measure the strength of the acids and ph is defined using an inverse logarithmic scale high acid grapes have a low ph and low acid grapes have a high ph because of the upside down scale ph values range from 2 8 to 4 2 for juices obtained from sound ripe grapes 
as grapes ripen malic acid is lost and the acid content decreases as the acidity decreases the ph value of the grape juice slowly increases late in the ripening process just as the grapes are reaching maturity potassium ions start accumulating in the juice the potassium ions interact with acids in the grapes and this interaction causes the ph of the juice to increase more rapidly just as the grapes are reaching maturity 
several weeks before expected harvest time winemakers start their annual crush routine they visit the vineyards every few days and collect grape samples then the grape samples are tested for sugar titratable acid and the ph in the winery laboratory winemakers use the ph sugar and ta data to help decide when the grapes should be picked 
sugar content 
historically sugar content was the primary indicator of grape ripeness and many growers still rely on sugar readings to decide when the grapes are ripe consequently obtaining accurate sugar measurements is important grape sugar content is usually measured in units of degrees brix and the measurement is made with a hydrometer or a hand held optical instrument called a refractometer the accuracy of either instrument depends upon temperature most instruments are calibrated at a temperature of 68 degrees fahrenheit and a correction must be applied to the readings when measurements are made at any other temperature some refractometers are temperature compensated and the compensation greatly reduces the temperature error 
refractometers are handy sugar measurement instruments because they can measure the sugar content of a single drop of juice with good accuracy in most instruments each degree is subdivided into five parts and a value of 0 2 brix can be read directly on the refractometer scale well built temperature compensated refractometers cost about 300 and good uncompensated instruments can be purchased for less than 150 most winemakers prefer compensated instruments but data obtained with an uncompensated 
refractometer can easily be corrected for temperature the 
major advantage of refractometers is their ability to measure very 
small samples of juice quickly and easily temp correction 
both short range 16 to 25 brix and long range 2 to 30 brix 56 0 38 
hydrometers are available short range instruments cost about 58 0 32 
twenty dollars and long range hydrometers cost less than ten 60 0 26 
dollars the scale on good short range hydrometers can be read 62 0 20 
directly to 0 1 brix and good hydrometers have a certified 64 0 14 
calibration about 100 milliliters of juice are required to make a 66 0 08 
measurement when hydrometers are used with small diameter 68 0 00 
cylinders despite their low cost good hydrometers are more 70 +0 07 
accurate than hand held refractometers 72 +0 14 
 74 +0 22 
the accuracy of measurements taken with hydrometers also 76 +0 30 
depends on temperature hydrometers must be used at their 78 +0 38 
calibration temperature or a correction for temperature must be 80 +0 46 
applied to the readings a typical hydrometer correction chart is 82 +0 54 
shown in table 8 high accuracy and low cost are the major 84 +0 62 
advantages of brix hydrometers some winemakers avoid 86 +0 71 
temperature corrections by making sure the temperature of the 88 +0 80 
grapes and the hydrometer is at the calibration temperature

grape samples are brought into the winery lab and allowed to 
corrections for brix 
come to temperature equilibrium when the grapes have cooled 

hydrometers 
to room temperature the grapes and hydrometer are at or close to the calibration temperature and corrections are not needed 
taking sugar samples 
making accurate sugar measurements in large vineyards is not easy the grapes from a single cluster contain different amounts of sugar grapes from high on the cluster normally contain more sugar than grapes from the bottom of the cluster grapes taken from clusters exposed to the sun contain more sugar than grapes taken from clusters growing in heavy shade grapes taken from vines growing in different parts of a vineyard can have large differences in sugar content variations of two degrees brix often occurs over a ten acre vineyard block 
because of the large variations in sugar content large size samples must be collected to produce accurate results samples of about 100 individual berries are considered the minimum size for small vineyards and many winemakers prefer 200 to 1000 berries 
besides a large sample size measurement accuracy also depends on how sample grapes are collected the grapes must be collected in a consistent way from the area to be picked or the results will be misleading for example an adequate uniform and reasonable size sample could be collected by picking one grape from each vine in a 100 vine vineyard in a tiny vineyard of 30 vines picking one grape from three or four clusters on each vine would be appropriate a much larger sample would be picked in vineyards containing several thousand vines here a uniform sample of several hundred grapes would be collected by picking one grape from every fourth or fifth vine 
collecting a representative sample of grapes from the area to be picked is very important if the intent is to pick the first six rows in a block of vines then only first six rows should be sampled if the whole vineyard will be picked then the entire vineyard should be sampled 
collection procedure 
the following grape collection procedure has been used for some time this method produces good results and the procedure is particularly useful when several different vineyard blocks are sampled on the same day 
 1 
a 1 quart size heavy weight zip seal baggy is used to collect the grapes the date and the vineyard block being sampled can be written on the baggy with a magic marker 

 2 
grapes can be collected from each vine every other vine every fifth vine etc but at least 100 grapes should be collected from the vineyard block of interest 

 3 
most of the sample grapes should be picked from the bottom of the clusters watch out for bees and wasps and most of the sample grapes should be picked from clusters growing in the heavy shade 

 4 
 the baggy should be sealed and the grapes kept cool until the measurements have been made 

sugar measurement procedure 
the measurement procedure described below assumes the sugar content is being measured with a short range hydrometer however once the juice has been collected at the end of step three the sugar could be measured with a refractometer 
 1 
remove any air from the baggy seal the baggy tightly and lay it on a smooth flat surface use a heavy flat bottomed glass tumbler to crush the grapes in the baggy gently crush all the grapes but be careful not to press too hard because the seeds can puncture the baggy and cause messy leaks 

 2 
use both hands and knead the mass of grapes in the baggy for several seconds to extract the juice 

 3 
unseal the baggy and hold the lip of the baggy over a hydrometer cylinder with the left hand 

and carefully squeeze the juice out of the baggy with the right hand with a little practice the seeds skins and pulp can be retained in the baggy 

 4 
when the cylinder is about half full of juice lower the hydrometer into the cylinder 

 5 
add more juice until the hydrometer is floating at a convenient height 

 6 
wait a minute to let the hydrometer settle then tap the cylinder a few times to make sure the hydrometer is not stuck to the side of the cylinder 

 7 
read the hydrometer scale at the bottom of the meniscus and record the brix value 

 8 
remove the hydrometer from the sample and measure the temperature of the juice with a thermometer 

 9 
use a hydrometer temperature correction chart see table 8 and apply the appropriate correction to the measured value 

summary 
high quality wine can only be made from high quality grapes and grapes are in prime condition for just a few days picking wine grapes near optimum ripeness is very important so winemakers start sampling the grapes well before harvest time large size samples are collected and a variety of measurements are used to decide when to pick the grapes each crush season 
sugar content is the traditional way of judging grape ripeness but winemakers also measure acidity and ph 
 in addition winemakers also carefully smell and taste the flavor characteristics of the sample juice each winemaker has his or her way of noting and recording grape flavor attributes and experienced winemakers make his or her picking decisions based on many different factors 
chapter 10 

grape processing 
beginning winemakers often view crushing and pressing as the most important parts of winemaking however these operations are only simple mechanical operations machines do the crushing and the pressing and if the machines are designed and operated properly the mechanical operations have little influence on the quality of the wine quality depends on many factors such as where the grapes were grown when the grapes were picked the acidity and the ph of the juice fermentation temperature skin contact time and other parameters wine quality is far more elusive than just being careful how the grapes are mashed and squeezed 
oxidation and biological changes start when the grapes are picked and just a few hours can make a significant difference in hot weather consequently winemakers should get to the vineyard early on picking day and they should be prepared to load transport and process the fruit as quickly as possible other problems can occur when grapes are picked late in the afternoon on a hot day fermentation temperatures can become excessive easily when warm grapes are fermented high temperature fermentations are not conducive to wine quality in addition hot fermentations can kill the yeast and result in stuck fermentations 
 commercial wineries cool juice quickly with a heat exchanger and a large refrigeration system home winemakers often let warm fruit sit overnight and cool before crushing either way experienced winemakers try to avoid crushing hot grapes 
crushing 
crushing breaks the skins of the berries and allows the juice to flow crushing should be done with a minimum of grinding and tearing of the grape tissues and the seeds should never be cracked or broken destemming is done to remove the fruit from the stems stems contain high levels of phenolic materials and these materials contribute bitterness and astringency to wine excessive quantities of stems can introduce a green herbaceous characteristic to the wine and practically all red grapes should be destemmed before fermentation is started on the other hand removing the stems from white grapes is not necessary when the fruit is pressed immediately sometimes not removing stems from white grapes is advantageous the pulp of some white grape varieties is very slippery and the slick pulp makes these varieties difficult to press varieties like muscat alexandria have slick pulp and they are much easier to press if the stems are left in the must 
hand crushing red grapes 
crushing a small quantity of red grapes by hand is easy but wine yields will be low unless a good wine press is used to separate the new wine from the solids at the end of fermentation several hand crushing 
techniques have been developed and most of these procedures are satisfactory for handling small quantities the following procedure is simple and it can be used for quantities of 200 or 300 pounds 
 1 
place a clean plastic milk crate on a new 32 gallon plastic trash can or any other suitable ridged container 

 2 
place several pounds of grapes in the crate smash the clusters with a board or with both hands 

 3 
 use a wash board scrubbing motion with one hand the grapes and juice will fall through the bottom of the crate into the container and the stems will remain in the crate 

 4 
remove the bare stems from the crate 

 5 
repeat this procedure 


not all of the grapes will be crushed but unbroken berries will not cause problems when the fermentation is pressed the wine press will break the skins of the whole berries and most of the juice will be recovered 
 in fact some winemakers deliberately leave some whole berries in their fermentations these winemakers feel the presence of whole grapes during fermentation increases the fruitiness of the finished wine 
the stems of some grape varieties are abrasive and the above procedure can be hard on the hands after an hour or two fingers can become raw and hands become badly stained a pair of heavy rubber gloves may be desirable when large quantities of fruit are crushed by hand 
crushing by foot 
crushing grapes with bare feet is a popular notion but bare feet are not very practical grapes stain bare feet black not red grape tannin can cause bare feet to become very dry and the skin around the toes sometimes cracks some varieties of grapes have stiff sharp stems and these stems can be uncomfortable to tender bare feet 
crushing several hundred pounds of red grapes by foot is quite feasible but instead of bare feet an old pair of well scrubbed rubber boots should be used a shallow rigid container of some kind is needed to hold the fruit large plastic mortar boxes are available at large hardware stores and these shallow boxes make suitable containers a rhythmic motion should be used when crushing the feet should be kept moving around in the container to make sure the grapes in the corners of the container are crushed grapes can be slippery and some kind of hand support will be needed to help maintain balance as the grapes are stomped 
hand crank crushers 
most home winemakers use a hand crank crusher both single and double roller crushers work well although some machines are easier to crank than others these little machines are simple to operate place the crusher on top of a suitable container and fill the hopper with fruit turning the crank at a moderate rate pulls the clusters of grapes between the rollers the grape skins are broken and the crushed grapes juice and stems drop into the container hand crank crushers should be adjusted to a convenient working height and cranking the crusher will be much easier if a clamp is used to hold the machine steady most winemakers crush all of the grapes and then they destem the must a few winemakers do not destem the grapes from some red varieties at all 
crusher/stemmer 
commercial wineries and some advanced home winemakers use a motor driven crusher/stemmer to process the grapes a crusher/stemmer crushes the berries and removes the stems in one easy operation the better designed machines have power driven augers to move the fruit along the hopper into the crushing mechanism operation is simple and fast grape clusters are dumped into the hopper and the machine does the rest 
power crushers have capacities ranging from about 1 ton to more than 50 tons per hour even the smallest machines crush and destem large quantities of fruit in a short time one person is busy keeping the hopper full of grapes power crushers save a great deal of labor but they are expensive small power crushers made of painted steel sell for six or seven hundred dollars the same machine fabricated from stainless steel sells for about 1000 justifying the expense of a power crusher is difficult for home winemakers unless several barrels of wine are made each year 
pressing 
the process used to separate the liquid from the grape solids is called pressing squeezing a small amount of juice from white grapes by hand is possible however juice yields will be low and a surprising amount of labor is required to squeeze sweet pomace by hand a press of some sort is a practical necessity for making more than a gallon or two of white wine 
pressing red fermentations is a different situation as red grapes ferment alcohol breaks down the cell tissues the partially disintegrated pulp then gives up the juice more readily and red pomace is much easier to press than white grapes pressing small red fermentations by hand is relatively easy and reasonable quantities of wine can be recovered 
hand pressing red pomace 
the following hand pressing method is suitable if the grapes were crushed completely

 obtain a clean plastic milk crate and then cut a piece of 3/4 inch plywood to fit inside the milk crate the wood should fit loosely 

 2 
 when fermentation is complete let the cap rise overnight and carefully siphon off as much free run wine as possible 

 3 
 place the plastic milk crate on a 32 gallon plastic trash can or other suitable container and put a double layer of plastic window screening in the bottom of the crate 

 4 
 nearly fill the crate with the wet pomace and place the plywood on top press the pomace by hand and then place a heavy weight on the plywood 

 5 
 let the pomace drain for 15 or 20 minutes then stir the pomace and repeat step four 


depending upon the grape variety and the length of the fermentation 60 to 80 percent of the potential wine can be recovered by hand pressing using this method 
basket press 
most home winemakers use a vertical basket press of some kind and some of these presses are designed to produce high pressures high press pressures dry the pomace quickly but high pressures can also produce astringent and bitter wines very high press pressures are not desirable and compound ratchet type presses must be used with care the following procedure produces good results when modest press pressures are used 
 1 
fill the basket with crushed fruit add the top plates the blocks and the press head apply a small amount of pressure until a steady flow of juice is produced 

 2 
when the flow almost stops increase the pressure by a small amount and wait again large amounts of foam between the basket slats will oxidize the juice and the foam is an indication that pressure is being applied too rapidly 

 3 
continue increasing the pressure in steps until no more liquid can be obtained 

 4 
 disassemble the press by removing the press head blocks top plates and the basket 


 5 remove the pomace cake from the press place the pomace in a shallow container or on a clean concrete floor and crumble the cake with a shovel 
 6 replace the basket on the press fill the basket with the pomace reassemble the press and start the next pressing cycle 
depending on the variety of the grapes about 150 gallons of high quality juice can be produced from a ton of grapes using these procedures however the pomace cake must be crumbled several times to produce 150 gallons of juice pressing white grapes with a vertical basket press is a lengthy procedure and much labor is required to break down the press and crumble the pomace several times 
labor is expensive so commercial wineries no longer use vertical basket presses instead most wineries use bladder or membrane horizontal presses because the machines can crumble the pomace cake automatically consequently many press cycles can be used economically and six or more press cycles are often used to dry the pomace completely instead of using high pressures and two or three press cycles modern horizontal wine presses use low pressures and many cycles to produce 160 to 180 gallons of high quality juice from a ton of fruit 
must adjustments 
winemakers carefully measure the juice when the grapes are crushed so any needed adjustments can be made before starting fermentation if sulfur dioxide was not added when the grapes were crushed it would be added at this time small additions of yeast nutrient would be made to grapes grown in vineyards deficient in nitrogen and tartaric acid would usually be added to fruit grown in warm viticulture regions 
sulfur dioxide so2 
sulfur dioxide helps control wild yeast growth and so2 is effective in suppressing several types of bacteria it also helps reduce oxidation of the must juice or wine big wineries use large quantities of so2 so they purchase sulfur dioxide gas in steel pressure cylinders small wineries and home winemakers generally use potassium metabisulfite sulfite crystals to produce sulfur dioxide gas generally 25 to 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes before fermentation 
sulfur dioxide is more effective when it is added early in the process larger wineries have an so2 container and a metering pump mounted right on the crusher the sulfur dioxide is automatically dispensed whenever grapes are going through the crusher home winemakers usually add a half teaspoon of sulfite crystals for every 100 pounds of grapes the sulfite powder is dissolved in a small amount of water and the solution is added to the grapes as they are being crushed a few winemakers do not add sulfur dioxide early they feel white wines retain better color and malolactic fermentation is easier to complete when no sulfur dioxide is added as the grapes are crushed these winemakers prefer to make the first sulfur dioxide addition later in the winemaking cycle however most experts uc davis vinquiry the wine lab etc recommend the addition of small quantities of sulfur dioxide early when the fruit is crushed adding sulfur dioxide early is a much safer procedure for beginning winemakers 
yeast nutrients 
many yeast cells are needed to complete fermentation and yeast must have access to nitrogen vitamins minerals and other materials to produce new cells some grape varieties like chardonnay often lack sufficient nitrogen to meet the needs of the yeast and chardonnay juice is often difficult to ferment to dryness unless extra nutrients are added small wineries and home winemakers seldom have the equipment needed to measure juice nutrients so these winemakers add small quantities of nutrients to all grapes nevertheless yeast nutrients must be used with care because excessive quantities can produce off odors in the wine the manufacturers directions should always be followed carefully 
acid 
tartaric malic and citric acids are present in grapes and several other organic acids are present in wine the tart taste of wine is directly related to the quantity of acids present when a wine contains too much or too little acid the wine will be out of balance most grape varieties grown in the interior valleys of california are deficient in acid when fully ripe when grapes lack acidity winemakers often add tartaric acid before starting fermentation 
titratable acidity is a measure of the sum of all the organic acids in juice or wine most winemakers prefer to ferment white juice when the titratable acid is in the 0 7 to 0 9 percent gram/100 milliliters range red musts are often adjusted to a titratable acid of about 0 7 percent before fermentation the titratable acid of the fruit is always measured at crush time and any needed acid

table 9 tartaric acid additions for deficient juices 
carbonate k2co3 to reduce the acid content of juice or must before fermentation is started these materials precipitate acid salts from the juice and when most of the acid in the grapes is tartaric acid substantial acid reductions are possible approximately 3 5 grams of calcium carbonate per gallon of juice will reduce the titratable acid by 0 1% these carbonates must be used with caution because large quantities of either material can raise juice ph to excessively high values most winemakers use just enough carbonates to raise the ph of the juice to about 3 3 at this ph value ml fermentation can usually be relied on to reduce the acid content to a reasonable level 
ph 
another important acid parameter is ph it gives the winemaker information about just how much sulfur dioxide will be needed to control the wine microorganisms juices with low ph values 2 9 3 3 require little sulfur dioxide and medium ph juices 3 4 3 6 require an average dose high ph juices 3 7 4 1 often require a prohibitively large addition of sulfur dioxide to control the wine microbes effectively 
when working with grapes grown in a warm area some winemakers add tartaric acid until the titratable acid is raised to approximately 0 8 percent other winemakers simply ignore the titratable acid content and they add tartaric acid until the ph of the juice drops to about 3 4 experienced winemakers taste the juice and measure the titratable acid and ph these winemakers use all of the information available when making pre fermentation acid adjustments 
sugar additions 
when grapes are mature low sugar content is not a problem gapes low in sugar were picked too soon and making high quality wine from immature grapes is difficult immature fruit will be high in acid low in flavor and low in varietal flavors and aromas home winemakers are often advised to add sugar to immature fruit the additional sugar will increase the alcohol content of the wine but the extra sugar will not reduce the acidity increase the flavor or improve the weak varietal characteristics unless the winemaker is interested in producing wines high in alcohol adding sugar to underripe grapes is seldom advisable in colder growing regions frost danger sometimes occurs before the grapes are completely ripe and growers must pick or lose their crops here adding sugar to the juice until the hydrometer reads 20 brix or so might result in better quality wine attempting to make a big red wine from such immature fruit is hopeless generally underripe red grapes are best used by making blush wine ordinary white table sugar sucrose should be added to the juice or must 
cold settling white juice 
much research has been done on white wine fermentations this work clearly shows that fresher more fruity wines are produced when bits of skin and pulp fragments are removed before fermentation removing solid materials from the juice results in slower better controlled fermentations and the wines have less off flavors and off odors treating white juices to reduce the amount of suspended material to 1 or 2 percent before fermentation has become a standard winemaking procedure solids can be removed from juices with a centrifuge by filtration or by cold settling centrifuges and lees filters are expensive pieces of equipment so smaller wineries and home winemakers generally use a cold settling procedure to clarify white juices 
the procedure is simple immediately after pressing the juice is cooled about 50 degrees so it will not start to ferment the cold juice is allowed to settle overnight in a closed container in the morning the clarified juice is racked off the sediment and the solid material is discarded only clear juice is fermented when making white or blush wines sometimes additional clear juice can be obtained by resettling the lees but the lees must be kept cold or spontaneous fermentation will start 
summary 
crushing is the mechanical operation that breaks the skins of the berries and starts the juice flowing crushing should be done with a minimum of grinding and tearing of the grape tissues grape seeds should never be broken pressing is the mechanical operation used to separate the liquid from the solids pressing should be done at low pressures to reduce the extraction of bitter and astringent materials 
twenty five to fifty milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of juice should be added to the grapes as they are crushed juice should be tested and any needed adjustments should be made before fermentation is started 
the quality of all white and blush table wines can be significantly improved by reducing the amount of suspended material to 1 or 2 percent before fermentation solids can be removed by settling cold juice and then racking the clear juice off the sediment 
making an off dry low alcohol blush wine is often the best way to use underripe red grapes 
chapter 11 

wine yeasts 
the flavor characteristics of wine depend upon many factors however the yeast used for fermentation contributes little to the flavors of aged wine and most flavor contributions from the yeast will be undetectable in wines aged in oak barrels for normal periods many other winemaking factors such as fruit quality grape variety the climate fermentation temperature lees contact cap manipulation etc influence wine flavors much more than yeast 
light bodied fruity wines are exceptions these wines are bottled and consumed when they are young and the effects of the yeast are still noticeable under these conditions subtle flavor and aroma variations can be produced by different strains of yeast 
yeast characteristics 
large differences in wine yeasts do exist however these differences relate to properties other than creating wine flavors yeast characteristics important to winemakers include speed of fermentation color extraction how much alcohol is produced tendencies to stick the quantity of foam generated hydrogen sulfide production etc 
a few wineries use a different type of yeast for each wine produced many smaller wineries ferment all of their wines with only one or two types of yeast the research winery at the university of california at davis uses a single yeast type for all standard fermentations smaller wineries and home winemakers often use prise de mousse yeast for all their fermentations 
yeast names often mislead and confuse novice winemakers for example pasteur champagne yeast is not very good for sparkling wine production california champagne or prise de mousse are better yeasts for the secondary fermentation of sparkling wines instead of implying use the name shows the yeast strain originally came from the champagne district of france to complicate matters further the same name is sometimes used by different yeast manufacturers to identify completely different yeast strains a few years age two entirely different yeast strains of yeast were available commercially and both were called prise de mousse when placing orders for yeast winemakers can avoid confusion by providing the name of the yeast the name of the manufacturer and the yeast designation number 
yeast types 
wine yeast can be purchased in both liquid and dry forms however dry yeast is easier for small wineries and home winemakers to use recommended applications of some popular dry lalvin yeasts are shown in figure 3 and some important yeast characteristics are shown in figure 4 
epernay ii 
this is a popular yeast for producing light fruity style white and blush wines and epernay is also popular for producing wines made from fruit other than grapes sometimes epernay is used for producing light fruity style chardonnay wines however chardonnay juice can be difficult to ferment completely and stuck fermentation often results when epernay yeast is used with chardonnay

epernay is used at fermentation temperatures ranging from 50 to 70 degrees under these conditions it produces slow controlled fermentations and volatile components in the juice are retained well excessive foaming is seldom a problem when epernay is used epernay does not ferment well at low temperatures and it is very sensitive to sudden changes in fermentation temperature cold shock 
 epernay is often used when winemakers intend to leave some residual sugar in a wine usually active epernay fermentations can often be stopped just by lowering

the temperature of the tank 
epernay yeast is sensitive to high alcohol levels consequently epernay should not be used in juices with high brix values unless some residual sugar is wanted epernay yeast can produce very pleasant fruity aroma characteristics in young wines and home winemakers use epernay yeast for fermenting fruit wines because of the fruity aromas produced this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk form 
california champagne ucd 505 
this yeast is used primarily for the secondary fermentation of sparkling wines it produces a simple clean yeasty fermentation and these characteristics are desirable in most sparklers after a reasonable aging period ucd 505 yeast will flocculate into large clumps and the large pieces of yeast are much easier to riddle ucd 505 yeast is sensitive to alcohol and sulfur dioxide to insure prompt clean secondary fermentations the free so2 level of the cuvje should not exceed about 25 milligrams per liter and the alcohol content should be less than 11 percent small quantities of yeast nutrient are often used with this yeast ucd 505 is available only in 500 gram packages and in bulk 
montrachet ucd 522 
montrachet was a very popular yeast for producing well colored red wines and big white wines for many years montrachet produces strong vigorous fermentations and some type of cooling is often necessary in warm weather 
unfortunately montrachet yeast often produces excessive quantities of hydrogen sulfide and it has fallen into disfavor in recent years grapes low in nitrogen should always be augmented with a yeast nutrient or dap when montrachet yeast is used and prudent winemakers make it a point to smell all montrachet fermentations several times each day montrachet yeast should never be used with grapes containing residual sulfur dust this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk 
pasteur champagne ucd 595 
contrary to its name pasteur champagne yeast is not well suited for sparkling wine secondary fermentations it can be used for sparkling wines but ucd 595 produces very fine lees and the light fluffy lees make riddling difficult pasteur champagne yeast is tolerant of high alcohol levels and sulfur dioxide so it is often used to restart stuck fermentations some wineries use this yeast for both white and red fermentations and it can be counted on to produce clean neutral fermentations when used under reasonable fermentation conditions it seldom leaves residual sugar sometimes pasteur champagne yeast produces large quantities of foam in warm weather this yeast is available in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk 
prise de mousse e c 1118 
since it became available in dry form several years ago the popularity of prise de mousse pdm yeast has increased rapidly pdm is an excellent general purpose yeast for both red and white wines it produces low hydrogen sulfide fermentations and it ferments vigorously since this yeast usually produces a dry wine it is one of the more popular yeasts for california chardonnay production this yeast is tolerant to sulfur dioxide and it is tolerant to high alcohol levels consequently prise de mousse is useful for restarting stuck fermentations prise de mousse is also used for the secondary fermentation of sparkling wine under normal condition prise de mousse produces little foam and seldom causes the winemaker any trouble smaller wineries often use this yeast for all their fermentations pdm is available in five gram envelopes 500 gram packages and in bulk 
steinberg 
steinberg yeast is used for producing classical cold fermented riesling wines and it is used extensively for gewurztraminer production when used at low fermentation temperatures steinberg produces a delicate complex bouquet of fruit odors in young white wines this yeast is very cold tolerant and it often continues fermenting at temperatures below 40 degrees however this yeast is very sensitive to sulfur dioxide and steinberg fermentations can be retarded significantly if more than 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added at the crusher sometimes winemakers can deliberately stop low temperature steinberg fermentations just by adding a large dose of sulfur dioxide to the tank this yeast is only available in 500 gram packages and in bulk 
pasteur red 
pasteur red yeast has been available commercially for some time but it has only been produced in dry form for the past several years in dry form pasteur red is rapidly becoming the yeast of choice for producing full bodied red wines pasteur red produces clean fermentations and it has good color extraction characteristics this yeast seems particularly well suited for fermenting deeply colored bordeaux style red wines pasteur red yeast is vigorous and some cooling is often needed in warm weather pasteur red yeast can be purchased in five gram packets 500 gram packages and in bulk form 
summary 
the type of yeast used for fermentation has little influence on the aromas and flavors of aged wines however yeast can contribute to the aroma of young fruity wines 
yeast is available in liquid and dry form but dry yeast is much easier for small producers to store and use 
prise de mousse yeast produces little foam and seldom causes fermentation problems some small wineries use prise de mousse for all of their red and white fermentations and they also use it to restart stuck fermentations 
chapter 12 
primary

 fermentation 
practically all red grapes have clear colorless juice the red pigment is in the grape skins red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp and skins together and during fermentation the red color is extracted from the skins after several days of fermentation the new red wine is pressed and the liquid is separated from the solids besides color many other materials are extracted from the skins during fermentation and these materials produce the slight bitterness and astringency typical of red wine 
white and blush wines are produced differently these wines are made by crushing and then pressing the crushed grapes the liquid is separated from the solids before fermentation is started white and blush wines are made by fermenting clear juice almost no skin contact occurs and only small amounts of color bitterness or astringency are extracted from the skins 
white wine can be made from red grapes if the contact between the juice and the skins is limited french champagne is made from pinot noir grapes and pinot noir is a red grape white zinfandel and all blush wines are considered white wines because the juice is separated from the solids before fermentation rosj wines on the other hand are considered red wines because they are fermented with the juice and the skins in contact for a short time winemakers use the terms white and red in two different ways besides describing color these terms also indicate the way wine is fermented 
yeast growth 
wine yeasts are microscopically small single cell organisms like every living organism yeasts need energy to survive and the necessary energy is obtained by metabolizing grape sugars ethyl alcohol is produced as an end product but the yeasts do not use the alcohol they are only concerned with the energy produced when the sugars are converted into alcohol besides sugar yeasts must have access to many other materials to reproduce new cells and yeasts are sensitive to their environments 
the conversion of glucose into alcohol is a complicated multi step biochemical process several different enzymes are needed to convert the sugars and yeast must have access to vitamins minerals oxygen nitrogen etc to produce the required enzymes grape juice normally contains all the necessary materials but sometimes fermentations lack one or more of these critical growth factors and the yeast cannot convert all of the grape sugars into alcohol most stuck fermentations are caused by deficiencies in the starting juice or by excessively high or low temperatures 
oxygen 
yeast reproduces rapidly when sufficient oxygen is available when the environment is optimum yeast populations can double in less than an hour this rapid period of yeast growth is called the exponential growth phase and an enormous yeast population 10 million cells per milliliter of juice can develop in less than 24 hours rapid cell growth occurs during the exponential growth phase but little alcohol is produced 
 the situation is different when oxygen is restricted with little oxygen yeast cell reproduction is much slower but the yeast produces larger amounts of ethyl alcohol 
from the winemakers point of view having oxygen available early in the fermentation process is always desirable yeast cells then multiply rapidly and a large yeast population is produced quickly later in the fermentation oxygen is deliberately restricted to promote alcohol production this simple technique allows winemakers to encourage early yeast growth and the large yeast population will convert the grape sugars in a dependable way 
a lack of oxygen is seldom a problem when wine is fermented under typical home winemaking conditions the quantity of oxygen needed by the yeast is small and more than enough oxygen is introduced when grapes are subjected to the normal winemaking processes of crushing and pressing 
nitrogen 
yeast must have protein to make new cells and yeast must have nitrogen to produce the protein normally grapes contain enough nitrogen to meet the yeasts needs however vineyards needing fertilization often produce fruit excessively low in nitrogen content and then the yeast has problems producing the large numbers of cells needed to complete fermentation winemakers often add small quantities of diammonium phosphate or other sources of nitrogen to juices low in nitrogen the diammonium phosphate gives yeast the nitrogen needed to produce new cells and complete the task of fermentation the yeast and the winemaker are then happy 
sometimes a problem develops when nitrogen is added near the end of fermentation a significant amount of alcohol has accumulated by this time the alcohol seems to prevent the intake of nitrogen by the yeast cells and sometimes the fermentation sticks to avoid this problem winemakers monitor their fermentations carefully and correct any nitrogen deficiencies early in the fermentation cycle before large amounts of alcohol accumulate 
micro nutrients 
yeasts also need an assortment of vitamins minerals and other growth factors yeasts require very small quantities of these substances so winemakers often call these materials micro nutrients normally grapes contain adequate quantities of these micro nutrients but some vineyards consistently produce grapes deficient in some particular growth factor in these cases winemakers try to avoid fermentation problems by adding a complete yeast food to the juice several commercial products such as superfood are produced specifically to supply yeast with these necessary micro nutrients 
yeasts often produce excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide when they lack pantothenic acid hydrogen sulfide produces the familiar rotten egg smell and even small quantities of hydrogen sulfide can damage wine quality and commercial and home winemakers routinely add minute quantities of pantothenic acid to 
fermentations pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased in any drug store 
handling dry yeast 
dry yeast looks almost indestructible however dry yeast consists of live cells and it must be handled with 
care yeast weakened by mishandling often requires an 
unusually long time to start fermenting and sometimes 
damaged yeast has trouble fermenting the juice to dryness 1 by prolonged storage at 
 figure 5 shows several ways yeast can be damaged 2 temperatures above 95 degrees by storage in a freezer 
 3 by prolonged exposure to air 
dry yeast will remain viable for at least two years when after the package is opened 
unopened packages are stored in a cool dry place 4 by rehydrating yeast in water 
however once a package has been opened the yeast that is to hot or to cold 
should be used within a few months using open packages 5 by excessive amounts of sulfur 
of dry yeast the next crush season is risky even when the open packages are stored under optimum conditions old 6 dioxide in the juice by juice temperatures either below 60 degrees or above 90 degrees 
dry yeast should be saved it is useful for fining wines 

figure 5 dry yeast can be damaged
containing ethyl acetate 

in several ways 
rehydrating dry yeast 
nine times out of ten satisfactory fermentations can be started just by sprinkling dry yeast on the must to avoid problems the tenth time all yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry yeast before it is added to the must yeast rehydration is a simple procedure just add the dry yeast to a small amount of warm water however the temperature of the water is important and a thermometer should be used to adjust the water temperature to 100 degrees about one cup of water is needed for a tablespoon of dry yeast stir the yeast mixture until it is smooth and then let it rehydrate after 20 to 30 minutes pour the yeast mixture into the must or juice most winemakers use about one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must 
red fermentations 
wine contains phenolic compounds in quantities ranging from 0 03 percent for white wines to about 0 5 percent for red wines although these quantities are small phenolic compounds are among the most important wine ingredients because phenolic materials are responsible for wine color some bouquet and flavor components bitterness astringency browning characteristics etc 
extraction 
tannins large condensed polymers and anthocyanins color pigments are the phenolic compounds of greatest interest to winemakers most of the phenolic materials in wine come from the grape skins seeds and stems some phenolic compounds are more soluble than others the more soluble compounds are extracted from the grape solids quickly but longer soak times are necessary to extract the less soluble phenolic materials other phenolic materials tannins are more soluble in alcohol than in water and these phenolic materials are extracted late in the fermentation cycle when the alcohol level is high pigment compounds and some flavor compounds are quite soluble in water and these materials are extracted earlier in the fermentation 
table 10 shows how pigment and tannin compounds accumulate as a function of skin contact time these data were obtained from a typical cabernet sauvignon fermentation and the data show four important features 1 more than 90 percent of the total available color was extracted in the first four days of the fermentation 2 the color intensity of the liquid started to decrease after about eight days of skin contact time 3 after 20 days of skin contact the color dropped to about three fourths of the maximum value 4 tannins continued to accumulate over the entire 30 day interval

soaking is used to produce red wines with a softer more fruity character wines produced this way require less aging and 
table 10 color and tannins are accumulated differently during
these wines can be consumed a few months after bottling 

fermentation 
small producers often use the following procedure to produce 
light fruity red wines 1 sound grapes are crushed and a 
small amount 30 mg/l of sulfur dioxide is added 2 the crushed grapes are placed in a closed container 
and the head space is blanketed with carbon dioxide gas 3 the must is cooled to 50 degrees or lower 

 4 the crushed grapes are held at the cold temperature for a time ranging from one to several days 5 the refrigeration is then removed and the crushed grapes are allowed to warm 6 when the crushed grapes reach room temperature they are inoculated with yeast and fermented in the usual way 
significant quantities of color and flavors are extracted from the grape solids during the prolonged cold skin contact time however little tannin is extracted during the cold soak because the juice contains no alcohol this technique can be used with any grape variety but cold soaking is particularly effective for pinot noir 
fermentations 
fermentation temperature 
red wines are normally fermented at temperatures ranging from 70 to 90 degrees within this temperature range fermentations lasting from four to ten days are typical small wineries and home winemakers often use open fermenters and most small red fermentation tanks are not fitted with elaborate temperature control equipment red fermentations can become fast and generate large quantities of heat in warm weather and sometimes winemakers get into trouble yeast is sensitive and cannot survive for long when fermentation temperatures exceed 90 degrees consequently small producers watch their fermentations carefully and when necessary they use cold water ice or any means available to cool their fermentation tanks red fermenters in large wineries are temperature controlled and fermentation temperatures are established simply by adjusting a thermostat 
cap management 
many small bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed during active fermentation in red fermentations the carbon dioxide bubbles stick to the grape skins and the bubbles make the skins more buoyant soon some skins float to the surface of the fermenting liquid and a thick layer of skins pulp and seeds accumulates after a few hours as the layer of skins rises liquid slowly drains away and this cap of skins becomes dry a dry cap in an open fermenter creates problems because vinegar bacteria can grow in the cap the vinegar bacteria convert alcohol into acetic acid and the acetic acid spoils the wine winemakers prevent this very undesirable condition by breaking up and submerging the cap periodically to keep the skins wet 
caps on small fermentations are not very thick and small caps can be managed easily by stirring the must with a large wood spoon two or three times each day in larger fermentations the cap becomes several inches thick and a special tool is needed to push the cap back down into the juice most winemakers punch down the cap at least twice a day several studies show more color and flavors are extracted when the cap is gently punched down several times a day during the first few days of fermentation 
large wineries ferment red wine in closed stainless steel tanks and they use a technique called pumping over to keep fermentation caps wet a powerful pump and a large hose are used liquid is pumped from the bottom of the tank to the top and sprayed over the cap 
early pressing 
the phenolic content of red wine depends on the length of time the liquid is in contact with the grape solids and skin contact time is a common method used to control the astringency of red wines the term early pressing is used when red fermentations are pressed before they reach dryness and early pressing is a common and effective technique for producing soft fruity red wines skin contact times are short so the tannin content is low usually four to seven days of skin contact will produce ample extraction when red wines are fermented at normal temperatures 
winemakers often produce light fruity red wines by pressing the fermentation when the sugar content drops to eight or ten degrees brix however wines pressed too early are often light in structure and these wines can lack complexity full bodied red wines are normally pressed when the hydrometer reads zero and some big red wines are kept on the skins for three or four weeks 
sometimes novice winemakers attempt to make a big red wine by using an extra long skin contact time unfortunately such attempts usually fail high quality wines can only be made from very high quality grapes and home winemakers seldom have access to outstanding fruit more than long skin contact times are required to make exceptional wines skin contact time is always something of a compromise there are no fixed rules knowing when to press a red fermentation is part of the winemaking art 
press pressure 
more tannin is extracted from the solids when press pressures are high because of this pressure effect press wine the wine obtained late in the pressing operation contains more phenolic material than free run wine the wine obtained before much pressure is applied consequently winemakers also use pressing technique to control red wine astringency 
most home winemakers mix the free run wine and the press wine together but many professional winemakers ferment and age the more astringent press wine separately if the winemaker feels more body and astringency are needed the press wine is blended into the main batch later holding press wine separate from the main batch gives these winemakers a simple convenient way to adjust red wine astringency 
white fermentations 
white wines are different from red wines white wines contain less phenolic material than red wines and consumers can tell the difference even when the wines are tasted in complete darkness white wines lack the slight bitterness and the astringency of red wines because the phenolic content is lower 
quality red wine can be made with rudimentary equipment but high quality white table wine is much more difficult to make with simple equipment white wine oxidizes easily and the effects of oxidation are more apparent any off odors or off tastes are very apparent in white or blush wines more and better winemaking equipment is needed to make high quality white table wine and home winemakers must be prepared to expend more time and effort 
pressing white grapes 
white grapes are more difficult to press than red grapes the pulp of some white varieties is very slippery and slimy and extracting juice from slimy pulp is difficult modern wine presses can be programmed to apply low pressures and execute many press cycles automatically the low pressures used and the many cycles remove juice efficiently from white pomace without extracting large amounts of astringent materials however most home winemakers use small vertical basket presses and separating juice from slippery pulp with a small hand press is a difficult and time consuming job 
cold settling white juice 
cleaner tasting fruitier wines are produced when juice contains less than 2 percent solids so removing solids before fermentation is an important step in producing high quality white and blush wines large wineries remove juice solids with a large filter system or with a centrifuge either method requires expensive equipment 
smaller wineries use a simple cold settling procedure to remove the solid materials from their white juices first the juice is cooled to less than 50 degrees and the solids are allowed to settle after 12 to 48 hours the clear juice is racked off the residue the juice is then allowed to come to room temperature and fermentation is started this is a simple effective procedure but unless the juice is well chilled it will start to ferment when spontaneous fermentation starts turbulence is created by the carbon dioxide gas and the turbulence stirs up the juice and prevents the solid material from settling 
fermentation temperature 
fermentation temperature is an important quality factor in white wine production producing high quality white table wine is very difficult unless fermentation temperatures can be kept below 60 degrees often novice winemakers do not appreciate the need for cold fermentation temperatures and large amounts of poor quality white table wine are made each season because of high fermentation temperatures low fermentation temperatures are necessary to retain the fruity characteristics of the grapes 
light fruity white or blush wines like riesling chenin blanc or white zinfandel are produced by fermenting well clarified juice at temperatures ranging from 40 to 55 degrees fermentation is very slow at these low temperatures the carbon dioxide gas is produced slowly and the bubbles are small little turbulence is produced and the volatile materials are retained in the juice instead of being blown away by violent bubbling 
steinberg yeast ferments well at low temperatures and it is often used to cold ferment riesling wines prise de mousse yeast also ferments well at low temperatures but some types of yeast do not for example epernay yeast seldom ferments to dryness at temperatures much lower than 50 degrees 
sometimes full bodied white table wines like chardonnay or sauvignon blanc are fermented in barrels and malolactic fermentation is often encouraged these wines are often aged both in bulk and in the bottle to produce depth and complexity full bodied white wines are usually fermented at temperatures ranging from 55 to 65 degrees 
hydrogen sulfide 
hydrogen sulfide gas h2s produces the familiar rotten egg smell this noxious gas can be produced by yeast during fermentation h2s can also be formed from decaying yeast cells when wine is left on gross lees for a long time most people can detect one part per million of this gas so very small quantities of hydrogen sulfide can completely spoil a fine wine most often hydrogen sulfide is produced from elemental sulfur during fermentation the sulfur enters the juice as a residue on grapes treated with sulfur sprays to control powdery mildew and the sulfur is converted into hydrogen sulfide by the reducing atmosphere of the fermentation 
sometimes hydrogen sulfide is produced by yeast when the grapes contain no residual sulfur here the smell is usually detected near the end of fermentation during the later part of fermentation yeast often runs short of some needed material and hydrogen sulfide can be produced when yeast does not have enough nitrogen micro nutrients or vitamins hydrogen sulfide is produced when fermentations do not contain enough pantothenic acid but hydrogen sulfide can be produced any time yeast is subjected to stressful conditions 
winemakers often add extra nitrogen and micro nutrients to their fermentations specifically to avoid the production of hydrogen sulfide gas diammonium phosphate is a commonly used source of nitrogen and proprietary yeast foods are added to provide the yeast a variety of micro nutrients adding extra yeast nutrients is a simple and inexpensive way of avoiding problems with stinking fermentations unfortunately hydrogen sulfide problems are occasionally encountered even when the best winemaking techniques are used 
removing hydrogen sulfide 
home winemakers often use the following procedure to remove hydrogen sulfide from wine 1 about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide is added to the wine when fermentation is complete 2 the wine is then aerated by racking with a great deal of splashing and bubbling this treatment converts the hydrogen sulfide back into elemental sulfur and the sulfur settles to the bottom of the container sometimes stinky wine needs to be racked two or three times to remove the stench completely 3 after a week or two the wine should be racked or filtered to remove the elemental sulfur the smell may reappear unless the sulfur is carefully removed aeration can result in oxidized wine so this procedure must be used carefully 
commercial wineries use copper to remove hydrogen sulfide from their wines a 1 percent solution of copper sulfate is commonly used about 0 1 milligrams of copper per liter of wine is produced when 150 milliliters of 1 percent copper sulphate pentahydrate solution is added to 1000 gallons of wine the copper converts the hydrogen sulfide into copper sulfide copper sulfide is not soluble in wine so it settles to the bottom of the tank a few days later the winemaker racks or filters the wine off the copper sulfide residue 
copper is a heavy metal and only very small quantities can be added to wine safely additions often range from 0 05 to 0 2 milligrams of copper per liter of wine mg/l and home winemakers should never add more than 0 5 mg/l bench testing and careful measurements are required when copper is used little hydrogen sulfide and very little copper will remain in the wine when just the right amount of copper sulfate solution is used 
completing fermentation 
winemakers monitor fermentations carefully to tell if the sugar is being converted at a reasonable rate and to detect any problems early small producers measure the temperature and the brix of ongoing fermentations once a day in larger wineries fermentations are usually tested twice a day each time the sugar is tested winemakers also check for potential problems by carefully smelling and tasting the sample this close attention allows any fermentation problems to be detected early the winemaker can then take prompt corrective action and avoid catastrophic wine failures 
testing for residual sugar 
sometimes novice winemakers have trouble deciding when fermentation is complete fermentation may be complete when the following three conditions are met 1 all bubbling has stopped 2 the brix has dropped to less than minus one and 3 the hydrometer readings have remained constant for several days even when all three conditions have been met some sugar can remain in the wine consequently most winemakers measure the residual sugar content in all wines shortly after the end of primary fermentation low levels of residual sugar can be quickly and easily measured using a clinitest kit these inexpensive kits can be purchased at most large drugstores for just a few dollars use the five drop method and follow the directions supplied carefully 
stuck fermentations 
winemakers use the term stuck when active fermentation stops before all the sugar is gone generally residual sugar in wine is a dangerous and undesirable condition residual sugar in wine represents major biological instability because fermentation can restart anytime when fermentation restarts late in the winemaking cycle much of the work done to clarify and stabilize the wine must be repeated then more processing is required and the additional handling will not help wine quality sometimes fermentation resumes after a wine is bottled and the yeast produces an unsightly sediment in the bottle the wine becomes effervescent and sometimes the bottles explode when the clinitest measurement shows significant sugar remains in wine appropriate steps must be taken to insure future wine stability 
stuck fermentations can be due to a lack of nitrogen the lack of an essential yeast nutrient the use of damaged yeast excessively low or high fermentation temperatures etc whatever the causes prompt action is needed and the stuck fermentation should be restarted as quickly as possible 
first a thermometer should be used to make sure the temperature of the stuck fermentation is neither too high nor too low and the stuck fermentation should be racked sometimes racking with a little splashing and bubbling will be enough to rejuvenate the yeast and restart a stuck wine if nitrogen deficiency is expected diammonium phosphate should be added to the stuck wine if the fermentation stopped early with lots of sugar remaining the additional nitrogen may restart fermentation on the other hand when little sugar remains the stuck fermentation should be re inoculated with a fresh batch of alcohol tolerant yeast prise de mousse or pasteur champagne after the nitrogen addition 
more effort is often required to restart stuck fermentations the following method is often successful if the original problem has been corrected 1 make a gallon of starter using either pasteur champagne or prise de mousse yeast 2 when the starter is active add a gallon of the stuck wine 3 wait until the starter becomes active again and then add two gallons of stuck wine 4 wait until the starter is active again then add four gallons of stuck wine 5 continue this doubling process until all of the stuck wine has been added once active fermentation is underway the wine should be monitored carefully by measuring brix twice a day when the hydrometer is steady and reads less than zero the wine should be tested with a clinitest tablet to be sure all the sugar is gone 
excessive acetic acid 
acetic acid is toxic to all strains of saccharomyces wine yeast yeast activity is curtailed and fermentation slows when the acetic acid content of fermenting juice exceeds about 0 1 percent when the acetic acid exceeds 0 2 to 0 3 percent few viable yeast cells can be found and fermentation stops 
a subtle fermentation problem can develop in the following way low acid high ph grapes are common in warm growing regions controlling native bacteria with sulfur dioxide is difficult when the ph of the juice is high and a large population of lactobacillus bacteria sometimes develops during the primary sugar fermentation the bacteria convert grape sugars directly into acetic acid and the acetic acid content of the fermentation becomes excessive under these conditions little or no ethyl acetate is produced and without ethyl acetate the winemaker is often unaware of the problem undetected the lactic bacteria can quickly raise the acetic acid level of the juice into the range of 0 1 to 0 4 percent the wine yeasts are unable to tolerate such high concentrations of acetic acid and the unhappy winemaker is left with a fermentation high in volatile acid and high in residual sugar this kind of stuck fermentation is almost impossible to restart because of the excessive amounts of acetic acid and the fermentation is often a total loss 
winemakers accustomed to working with low acid grapes avoid this type of lactic bacterial problem by adding tartaric acid before starting fermentation the tartaric acid lowers the ph of the juice and sulfur dioxide becomes more effective in controlling the bacteria 
summary 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp and skins together and during fermentation the red color is extracted from the skins fruity red wines can be produced by using several well known winemaking techniques such as cold soaking short skin contact times careful cap management and low press pressures 
 white and blush wines are produced by crushing and then pressing the grapes before fermentation is started 
low fermentation temperatures are essential for producing light fruity style white table wines 
a few simple precautions will avoid most fermentation problems active dry yeast should be stored in a cool dry place not in a refrigerator and yeast in packages from packages that have been open for more than a few months should be avoided a yeast suitable for the fermentation conditions temperatures and wine style should be chosen and the directions supplied by the manufacturer should always be followed when storing and rehydrating dry yeast 
fermentation progress should be monitored by measuring the brix each day with a hydrometer and by smelling and tasting the juice if fermentation appears sluggish nitrogen should be added before much alcohol has accumulated 
home winemakers remove hydrogen sulfide from wine when fermentation is complete by adding about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide the wine is then racked with a great deal of splashing and bubbling commercial wineries use copper sulfate to remove hydrogen sulfide from their wines 
moderate quantities of sulfur dioxide may not control bacteria in high ph juices effectively large populations of lactobacillus bacteria sometimes develop during the primary fermentation and produce excessive amounts of acetic acid and kill wine yeast 
chapter 13 
malolactic

 and other fermentations 

webster defines fermentation as a chemical change accompanied by effervescence beginning winemakers often think the transformation of sugar into ethyl alcohol is the only fermentation process occurring in wine but many other fermentations are possible in wine although the alcohol content and the high acidity makes wine a hostile environment for many microorganisms several yeasts and bacteria can exist and reproduce in wine besides the sugar transforming yeasts other microorganisms can convert one or more wine components into new materials the microorganism might use the new material as a growth building block or the transformation might be a source of energy for the microorganism the organic acids alcohols and glycerol are the wine ingredients most often metabolized by these other microorganisms winemakers call the transformation of grape sugars into ethanol by yeast primary fermentation and they usually call the other transformations secondary fermentations 
malolactic fermentation 
most high quality red wines are produced by two distinctly different fermentations first yeast converts the grape sugars into ethanol and then bacteria in the wine convert malic acid into lactic acid the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid by bacteria is called malolactic ml fermentation and ml fermentation produces significant changes in wine lactic acid is weaker than malic acid so ml fermentation reduces wine acidity this reduction in acidity is often used to improve the balance of wines excessively high in acid 
 ml fermentation removes unstable malic acid from the wine and when all of the malic acid is gone the wine is more biologically stable small quantities of different byproducts are produced during malolactic fermentation and some of these byproducts make positive contributions to the quality and complexity of the wine 
several different types of wine bacteria can convert malic acid into lactic acid these lactic bacteria consist of both cocci round and bacilli rod shaped microorganisms the principal bacteria responsible for ml fermentation in wine belong to the leuconostoc pediococcus and lactobacillus genera each genus contains several different species so the term malolactic bacteria refers to a group of microorganisms when wine undergoes spontaneous ml fermentation several different kinds of bacteria may be involved and these different microbes react in the wine in different ways depending upon conditions the microbes produce a variety of byproducts 
diacetyl 
diacetyl is one of several materials produced by ml bacteria diacetyl has an odor much like butter and diacetyl in wine can modify aroma characteristics significantly generally changes in wine aromas are subtle but some wines like chardonnay are often enhanced by very small quantities of diacetyl experienced winemakers produce specific wine styles by skillfully managing ml fermentation 
diacetyl is produced and metabolized by both ml bacteria and yeast when ml fermentation occurs during primary fermentation or while wine is aging on active yeast lees most of the diacetyl produced is metabolized by the yeast and little diacetyl remains in the wine a similar situation occurs when ml bacteria are allowed to remain in the wine after malolactic fermentation has been completed here the bacteria consume the diacetyl and after a few weeks little diacetyl remains in the wine 
sometimes winemakers leave larger amounts of diacetyl in the wine to produce the buttery characteristics so typical of a full bodied chardonnay when a winemaker wishes to leave larger quantities of diacetyl in the wine he uses the following strategy 1 when primary fermentation is complete and much of the yeast has settled the wine is racked off the gross lees 2 the wine is inoculated with ml bacteria 3 the ml fermentation is carefully monitored at least once each week 4 when ml fermentation is complete the winemaker adds about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to the wine and the sulfur dioxide kills the ml bacteria before they can metabolize the diacetyl considerable diacetyl can be left a wine using this technique 
at other times the winemaker may choose to leave little diacetyl in his wine here he uses a different strategy 1 the wine is inoculated with malolactic bacteria either during or just after the alcohol fermentation when many viable yeast cells are present in the wine 2 when ml fermentation is complete both the yeast lees and the bacteria are allowed to remain in the wine for several weeks before any sulfur dioxide is added during this time the yeast and the bacteria consume much of the diacetyl 3 when most of the diacetyl is gone the winemaker adds about 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to kill the bacteria the winemaker uses standard winemaking procedures to clean up the wine 
encouraging ml fermentation 
often winemakers wish to encourage ml fermentation even when diacetyl is not wanted red wines high in acid benefit from ml fermentation because the total acidity is reduced and the wine has a better balance after ml fermentation red wines are more stable when the malic acid is gone and many winemakers do not want to risk ml fermentation after the wine is bottled 
spontaneous malolactic fermentation can be encouraged in several ways 1 only small amounts 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes when they are crushed 2 keeping wine ph values greater than 3 2 encourages the bacteria 3 keeping the wine temperature above 60 degrees encourages ml fermentation 4 keeping wine on yeast lees for several weeks can encourage ml fermentation 
winemakers often inoculate their wines with malolactic bacteria to promote ml fermentation and pure strains of bacteria are commercially available in both liquid and dry forms leuconostoc oenos are the bacteria most often used bacteria and yeast compete for micro nutrients in the juice so ml fermentation is more likely to occur when the bacteria are added early in the sugar fermentation before the yeast has consumed all the micro nutrients 
discouraging ml fermentation 
wines produced from grapes grown in warm areas are often excessively low in acid and these low acid wines may or may not benefit from ml fermentation many winemakers feel malolactic fermentation is not suitable for light fruity wines because the bacterial fermentation decreases fruitiness 
the following steps are often taken to discourage ml fermentation 1 nominal amounts 30 50 mg/l of sulfur dioxide are added to the grapes when they are crushed 2 when primary fermentation is complete the free so2 level is raised to about 30 milligrams per liter 3 the wine is racked off the yeast lees promptly and the wine is clarified quickly 4 keeping wine cold discourages ml bacteria 
wine stability 
the presence of malic acid in any wine represents a potential stability problem when wine contains malic acid ml fermentation can occur anytime and when ml fermentation occurs after wine has been bottled the results are often disastrous ml fermentation in the bottle results in bottle deposits off odors bad tastes and effervescent wine any red wine containing malic acid cannot be considered biologically stable so commercial winemakers take specific steps to improve long term wine stability before these wines are bottled 
commercial red wines containing malic acid are passed through a membrane filter at bottling time these wines are often perfectly clear and the filtration is not done to improve their appearance the filtration is done to remove the ml bacteria from the wine and sterile filtration is an effective means of preventing ml fermentation in the bottle fumaric acid can also be used to prevent ml fermentation in bottled wine and before effective sterile filters were available winemakers often added about 500 milligrams of fumaric acid per liter to their red wines just before bottling most home winemakers do not have sterile filtration equipment and many home winemakers continue to use fumaric acid to inhibit ml fermentation in bottled red wine 
other fermentations 
most other secondary fermentations have a detrimental influence on wine quality some secondary fermentations produce subtle changes in wine characteristics but other fermentations often produce gross wine spoilage the changes depend upon when the fermentations occur in the winemaking cycle on conditions and on the types of byproducts produced several common wine microorganisms and some problems produced by these microbes are discussed below 
lactic souring 
spontaneous malolactic fermentation is a common red winemaking phenomena however several different kinds of ml bacteria exist and different types of bacteria produce different byproducts in wine unfortunately many byproducts produced by malolactic bacteria other than ml fermentation are detrimental to wine quality 
the french enologist emile peynaud gives several rules for making red wine in his excellent book knowing and making wine one of his cardinal rules is make sure the sugars are fermented by yeast and the malic acid is fermented by bacteria this is sage advice because most types of lactic bacteria can and will ferment sugar when lactic bacteria attack grape sugars the glucose is converted into lactic acid and acetic acid and the fructose can be converted into a nasty material called mannitol when lactic bacteria ferment sugar the volatile acidity of the infected wine can increase rapidly and the wine often takes on a characteristic sweet sour taste this type of bacterial spoilage occurs most often when wines have an excessively high ph 
lactic souring and vinegar formation are quite different lactic bacteria produce acetic acid by fermenting the sugar unlike acetobacter lactic bacteria produce little ethyl acetate and large amounts of air are not required sometimes this type of spoilage is difficult to diagnose because the wine often has a good bouquet and the flavor may be good however a hot burning characteristic is always present in the aftertaste a lingering hotness in a wine always suggests excessive acetic acid and sweet sour tastes sometimes occur when considerable sugar remains in the wine lactic bacteria are probably the culprits rather than acetobacter when wine contains excessive acetic acid and little ethyl acetate 
controlling bacteria early in the fermentation is important because some types of lactic bacteria prefer sugar to malic acid most experts recommend treating grapes with 30 milligrams per liter of so2 at the crusher even if ml fermentation will be encouraged later in the winemaking process even at this low level the sulfur dioxide is effective in limiting early bacterial growth after a few days of fermentation the sulfur dioxide level in the wine will be very low and it will no longer inhibit the desired ml fermentation 
residual sugar & lactic bacteria 
stuck fermentations often occur in the following way first a neglected red fermentation overheats and the high temperature kills the yeast fermentation abruptly stops and considerable sugar remains in the wine the wine is warm and the wine contains sugar in this condition wine is extremely vulnerable some lactic bacteria are always in wine and when the wine is in this condition these bacteria often attack the remaining sugar the wine is warm and large amounts of acetic acid can be produced quickly a wine can spoil in a short time under these condition 
lactic souring is the great danger always associated with stuck fermentations and any significant amount of residual sugar places the wine in jeopardy consequently stuck fermentations should be restarted promptly before lactic bacteria can multiply to excessive levels this is why some winemakers prefer to inoculate with ml bacteria late in the alcohol fermentation when very little sugar remains in the wine 
restarting a stuck fermentation of this kind can be very difficult large amounts of acetic acid are in the wine and acetic acid is toxic to wine yeast large wineries remove the acetic acid by using a special reverse osmosis process when the excess acetic acid is gone new yeast is added to restart fermentation but reverse osmosis is a complicated process and applying it to small quantities of wine is seldom feasible small wineries and home winemakers deal with lactic souring problems primarily by prevention this is one reason 30 to 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide should be added when the grapes are crushed then tartaric acid is added to the crushed grapes and the ph is lower to less than 3 5 before fermentation is started 
acetaldehyde production 
candida mycoderma can oxidize ethyl alcohol in the wine into a very volatile liquid called acetaldehyde in small quantities acetaldehyde gives wine a distinctive nut like aroma acetaldehyde is the material that gives sherry its distinctive characteristics although the nutty quality is highly desirable in sherry excessive quantities of acetaldehyde give table wine a tired oxidized quality that most people do not appreciate like vinegar bacteria candida mycoderma needs large amounts of air this yeast is often seen as a thin patchy film floating on the surface of wine so winemakers call candida mycoderma film yeast fortunately film yeast is sensitive to sulfur dioxide 
the following is an effective treatment for wine infected with film yeast mix an appropriate quantity of sulfite crystals in a small amount of water then pour the sulfite solution onto the top surface of the wine pour carefully so mixing of the sulfur dioxide solution and the wine is reduced and a large amount of sulfur dioxide is concentrated at the surface since the bacteria are growing on or near the surface this is a potent treatment such dramatic treatments are seldom needed if the sulfur dioxide is maintained at reasonable levels and the wine containers are kept completely full and tightly sealed 
glycerol fermentation 
under certain conditions some types of lactic bacteria ferment glycerol in the wine into lactic and acetic acids small amounts of acrolein are also produced during glycerol fermentation the infected wine increases in volatile acidity and the wine takes on an unpleasant bitter taste this type of glycerol fermentation occurs most often in wines low in acid and with high values of ph glycerol fermentation is also more common in wine made from heavy press fractions or wines made from moldy grapes glycerol fermentation is not very common today because adjusting wine ph to 3 5 or less and maintaining 30 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine usually provides adequate protection against this type of wine infection 
tourne 
tartaric is one of the more stable organic acids however a few species of lactic bacteria can ferment tartaric acid into lactic acid acetic acid and carbon dioxide gas when tartaric acid is fermented the fixed acidity of wine decreases and the volatile acidity of wine increases the wine takes on a strange dull appearance and the color turns brown a strong and disagreeable mousy odor often develops 
the french name for this unfortunate wine condition is tourne and when the disease is advanced the wine becomes undrinkable tourne is a gross transformation and this sickness is more prevalent in wines having high ph values fortunately these bacteria are very sensitive to sulfur dioxide and maintaining reasonable levels of molecular sulfur dioxide in wine will prevent the development of tourne 
vinegar formation 
vinegar bacteria acetobacter are found in the vineyard on the grapes in the cellar on the equipment in the wood of used wine barrels and in the wine acetobacter is the bug that converts ethyl alcohol into acetic acid vinegar sometimes very small amounts of acetic acid in a red wine make a positive contribution to the aroma but when acetic acid exceeds about 0 04 percent it produces a burning aftertaste that quickly decreases wine quality in a warm cellar and with sufficient air present acetification can progress rapidly and fine wine can be spoiled in a short time along with the acetic acid vinegar bacteria also produce ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate has a strong aromatic smell like finger nail polish remover this odor is easy to identify and the smallest hint of ethyl acetate suggests acetobacter activity in a wine 
vinegar bacteria must have access to large quantities of air to oxidize the alcohol into acetic acid colonies of bacteria often develop as thick wrinkled mats on the surface of the wine where they have direct access to the air however vinegar bacteria can and do exist in the bulk of the wine barrels infected with vinegar bacteria should be taken out of service because disinfecting materials like wood is nearly impossible acetobacter activity is controlled by keeping the sulfur dioxide content of the wine at a reasonable level and by keeping wine containers completely full and tightly sealed 
summary 
besides the primary alcoholic fermentation several other microbial transformations often occur in wine malolactic fermentation reduces wine acidity and improves the long term stability of red wine ml fermentation produces the butter like quality prevalent in heavier style chardonnay wines and it adds pleasing complexity to red wines ml fermentation is generally encouraged in red wines because red wine containing malic acid is biologically unstable 
besides yeast many other microorganisms exist in wine these organisms can ferment normal wine components into significantly different materials and the products of some of these other fermentations can reduce wine quality 
when winemakers are aware of the microorganisms present they can take effective measures to prevent spoilage most types of bacteria are sensitive to small quantities of sulfur dioxide and many bacterial problems can be avoided by maintaining 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free so2 in the wine wine bacteria can also be controlled by other simple techniques adding tartaric acid to decrease wine ph and maintaining the wine at low temperatures are both effective control techniques keeping wine containers full and excluding air is usually all that is necessary to control vinegar bacteria winemakers often use sterile filtration to remove bugs from wine mechanically and under adverse condition pasteurization is sometimes necessary 
chapter 14 

fining and fining materials 
fining materials are used for the specific purpose of removing something from wine a wine might be fined to remove unwanted color haze bitterness excessive astringency off flavors unpleasant odors etc usually the fining agent itself is eliminated before the wine is bottled wine has been made for thousands of years and over that lengthy period many different materials have been used as wine fining agents each fining material has different characteristics so each material must be evaluated carefully 
sometimes two or more fining materials are needed to solve a single wine defect at other times the winemaker might be lucky and discover that a single fining agent can eliminate multiple wine problems for example a dark murky blush wine might be fined with bentonite a single application of bentonite might 
 1 remove excessive protein and make the wine hot stable the bentonite fining might also 2 improve the clarity of the young wine and 3 remove a small amount of the excess color 
using fining materials 
sometimes novice winemakers attempt to clear dull cloudy wines by filtration but these attempts can be frustrating and expensive polysaccharide gums yeast cells and some types of bacteria clog filter media very quickly and the unfortunate winemaker spends much time and expense changing filter pads using a fining material to clean up the wine is often a better approach several days after fining the wine is racked to eliminate most of the lees and then the wine can be filtered easily when it is reasonably clean 
bench testing 
bench tests are done on individual wines to decide which fining agent is the best material for the job bench tests are also used to learn how much fining material is needed tests are made by adding a carefully measured quantity of the proposed fining material to a small quantity of wine winemakers make several test samples and each sample contains a different quantity of the fining material after an appropriate time the winemaker examines the samples to see which quantity of fining material produced the desired results bench testing is a quick and convenient way for winemakers to try several different fining materials or different dose levels many winemakers use clear 750 milliliter wine bottles for bench testing however small wine samples require very small quantities of fining materials so precise measurements are necessary an accurate scale and good procedures are needed for meaningful results 
importance of dispersion 
all fining materials must be evenly dispersed throughout the volume of the wine many fining agents are dry powders and these materials must be mixed with a small amount of water or wine before being added to the wine most fining materials should be added slowly and thoroughly stirred into the wine a long handled spoon is satisfactory for mixing a fining agent into a few gallons of wine a motor driven propeller type mixer is more appropriate for larger containers such as barrels or small tanks many small wineries do not have mixing tanks so they often add fining materials when the wine is being racked from one tank into another the circulation produced by the pump provides adequate mixing 
multiple fining sequence 
sometimes a new wine will have several recognizable defects and it will be obvious to the winemaker that multiple fining treatments are needed when no other considerations exist fining operations should be done in the following sequence 1 cold stabilize the wine chilling also helps clean up the wine and chilling also reduces the microbe population 2 treat hydrogen sulfide problems with copper sulfate 3 use protein fining materials gelatin casein isinglass egg whites etc to treat astringency clarity or color problems 
 4 fine with bentonite to remove protein and hot stabilize white and blush wines the bentonite fining will help remove any left over protein material and it will also improve wine clarity sometimes klearmore sparkolloid or kieselsol are used to compact bentonite lees 
wineries often depart from the sequence given above to reduce handling they fine their white and blush wines with bentonite and then immediately cold stabilize the wine during cold stabilization the soft bentonite lees are compacted by the tartrate crystals and the compacted lees make racking easier white and blush wines will usually require some kind of treatment to improve clarity and sparkolloid is the fining material of choice for this purpose however getting white and blush wines completely clear and bright without using some kind of filtration is difficult on the other hand most red wines do not require extensive fining treatments these wines are often given a light protein fining racked a couple of times during bulk aging and then bottled 
partial fining 
removing unwanted material without removing other desirable wine components may not be possible and compromise is often required for example a delicate white table wine might have a slight bitterness in the aftertaste fining with a protein material might eliminate the bitterness but the protein might also remove much of the delicate fruit character this is a poor trade and the winemaker is faced with a dilemma sometimes an old german winemaking technique is effective in such circumstances here half the wine is deliberately over fined and half the wine is not fined at all when the wine is combined at least half the fruit characteristics are preserved and the bitterness may be reduced by 50 percent often the taste of the resulting product is superior to the original wine 
multiple fining 
sometimes multiple fining applications can effectively reduce wine astringency without devastating wine flavors and aromas for example some winemakers prefer to give tannic red wines several light gelatin fining applications during bulk aging instead of one large dose no extra handling is needed if the wine is fined before a regularly scheduled racking 
fining materials 

many materials can be used to fine wine some fining materials are expensive and other materials are difficult to find some fining materials are difficult to prepare or special equipment is required metal removing agents contain cyanide compounds and these fining materials are dangerous to use a few fining materials like gelatins skim milk and egg whites can be purchased at the corner market although many materials can be used to fine wine most winemakers only use a few fining materials routinely 
some characteristics preparation and use of several common wine fining materials are outlined below the characteristics and use of several common wine fining materials are shown

table 11 use and dose levels of common fining materials 
should not be used to 
clarify cloudy wines 
they are not beneficial 
when used in cloudy wines and excessive protein can cause additional problems 

the whites from one to four eggs are the usual quantities used for a barrel 60 gallons of wine this is 
roughly equivalent to to 2 milliliters of egg albumin per gallon of wine a small pinch of table salt should 
be added to a cup or so of warm water the egg white should be separated from the yoke carefully one 

part egg white should be mixed with two parts salt water the mixture should be stirred thoroughly before being added to the wine but the mixture should not be beaten to a stiff froth add the egg white mixture to the wine slowly and stir continuously the wine should be racked in a week or so 
bentonite 
bentonite is an extremely fine clay like material it has a negative electrical charge and it is used to remove positively charged particles from wine bentonite is most commonly used to remove excess protein from both white and blush wines it is also used for clarification fining of white and blush wines and sometimes bentonite is effective in clearing hazy fruit wines 
a normal dose is 1 to 2 grams of dry bentonite per gallon of wine however it is often used at dose levels that range from to 4 grams per gallon bentonite can strip desirable aromas from wine when used in excessive amounts more than 2 grams per gallon so bench testing should always be done bentonite should be mixed with water and allowed to stand for twenty four hours before being adding to the wine 
bentonite can be mixed easily in a blender put the required amount of hot water in the blender turn the blender on and slowly add the dry powder when the mixture is cool place it in a refrigerator and allow the bentonite mixture to hydrate for at least 24 hours add the hydrated mixture to the wine slowly and stir continuously bentonite is a popular fining material but it has a major disadvantage it produces large quantities of lees and the lees are light and fluffy wine is difficult to rack off bentonite lees because the lees are so light 
carbon charcoal 
carbon is fine black lightweight powder used to remove unwanted color and odors from wine although a common commercial fining material finely ground carbon is difficult to handle because it flies easily this material can be extremely dirty and sometimes home winemakers have difficulty obtaining carbons in small quantities because of the handling problem 
kbb carbons are acid activated and these carbons are used to remove unwanted color from wine kbb is often used to remove excessive browning from white table wines this material can improve the appearance of oxidized white and blush wines and it can give these wines a fresher cleaner taste kbb carbon is also used to treat juice from moldy grapes and large quantities of kbb carbon are used to remove excess red color from blanc de noir champagne materials 
aaa carbon is steam activated and it is most useful for removing undesirable odors from wine sometimes aaa carbon is used to remove the nail polish smell produced by ethyl acetate and it is used routinely when wines containing hydrogen sulfide rotten egg smell are treated with copper sulfate after the copper treatment a light aaa carbon fining is done to help keep the bad hydrogen sulfide odors from returning 
carbons are used at dose levels ranging from 1/16 to 5 or more grams per gallon of wine but more than a 
 gram per gallon can strip desirable color bouquet and flavors carbons must be used carefully and bench testing should be done before any carbon additions are made to the main batch sometimes commercial wineries use large quantities of carbon to strip a hopeless white wine completely practically all of the bouquet aromas and flavors are removed by the carbon treatment then the stripped wine is blended into a large batch of mediocre wine and a few gallons of muscat are added to the blend to improve the nose inexpensive off dry jug wines often contain a portion of stripped wine in the blend obviously the technique does little for wine quality 
casein 
 a half pint of skimmed milk in 5 gallons of wine is a traditional fining treatment for white wine milk contains casein and casein is still a popular fining material for white and blush wines casein is a protein and it is used to remove phenolic materials including tannin excessive oak character and some bitter flavors from wine sometimes casein is used to remove small amounts of unwanted color from blush wines and it is often used to remove the brownish tinge from oxidized white wines casein is very difficult to mix with wine so winemakers prefer to use this material in the form of potassium caseinate 
potassium caseinate solutions are not very effective when stirred directly into wine the casein reacts very quickly with acids in the wine and large lumps are formed the lumps of casein do little more than settle to the bottom of the container a better method is to inject the casein solution into the wine under pressure large wineries use small high pressure pumps to inject a cloud of tiny casein particles into the wine home winemakers often use a large syringe or a rubber bulb 
typical doses range between 0 1 and 1 gram of potassium caseinate per gallon of wine wines fined with excessive quantities of casein can develop a cheesy smell so care is needed when using this material bench testing should always be done before the main batch of wine is treated wine should be racked off casein lees after a week or ten days 
gelatin 
gelatin is a popular protein fining material and gelatins are often used to reduce the bitterness and astringency of red wines gelatin removes a quantity of tannin roughly equal to its own weight sometimes white wines have a slightly bitter finish and sometimes the bitterness can be reduced by fining with a small quantity of gelatin gelatins are also used to clarify white and blush wines and kieselsol is used to precipitate any excess gelatin residue 
most commercial winemakers prefer to use a high grade more than 100 bloom gelatin but some home winemakers buy gelatin for fining red wines at the local grocery store the grocery store product is sold as knox s gelatin and it comes in a box that contains four handy seven gram envelopes read the package carefully and be sure to buy an un flavored gelatin 
gelatin must be dissolved in water before being added to wine gelatin solutions can be prepared by using 1 or 2 grams of gelatin powder for 100 milliliters of warm water the gelatin powder should be added to the warm water slowly and much stirring is needed the mixture should stand for a few minutes and then the solution should be stirred again until all of the lumps are dissolved gelatin solutions should not be boiled because the heat will denature the protein and render the gelatin less effective the gelatin solution should be used while it is warm because it will solidify when cold add the warm gelatin solution to the wine very 
slowly and stir the wine continuously to assure good mixing 
from 1/4 to 2 grams of a dry gelatin per gallon of wine are used to reduce tannins and astringency in red wines doses ranging from 1/8 to grams of dry gelatin powder per gallon of wine are used to remove bitterness from white and blush wines and from 1/16 to 1/4 grams of gelatin per gallon of wine are used to clarify white and blush wines gelatin solutions must be used with care small doses can strip wines of desirable odors and flavors so bench testing should be done before gelatin is added to the main batch 
isinglass 
isinglass is a protein material made from the air bladders of sturgeon fish the commercial granular form of isinglass is called biofine and this form is much easier to use than the dried sheet material isinglass is used to clarify quality white wines some winemakers feel this material can improve wine flavors and aromas small quantities of isinglass are often added to sparkling wines to help riddling typical doses of isinglass range from 0 05 to 0 3 grams of dry isinglass per gallon of wine a nominal dose for white table wines is about 0 1 grams per gallon of wine make a solution by dissolving isinglass in a small quantity of low ph wine use about 100 milliliters of wine for each gram of granular isinglass and stir this solution into the wine thoroughly 
kieselsol 
kieselsol is a heavy liquid silica colloid nalco 1072 is the material most often used in the u s wine industry this material reacts with protein in the wine and precipitates out quickly kieselsol is sometimes used to remove excess protein material from white and blush wines 
kieselsol is often used in combination with gelatins to clarify white and blush wine and gelatin kieselsol fining often produces excellent clarification gelatin should be added to the wine first then the kieselsol should be added a day or two later only very small quantities of kieselsol are added to the wine so accurate measurements must be made about 1 milliliter of kieselsol is required for each gram of the gelatin the wine should be racked off the gelatin kieselsol lees after a week or ten days 
pvpp polyclar at 
pvpp is sold under the brand name polyclar at it is manufactured in the form of very small round plastic beads pvpp is a light weight plastic similar to nylon and this material is completely insoluble in water or wine pvpp is used to remove browning or pinking pigments from white or blush wines it is used to remove oxidized odors and for removing small amounts of bitter phenolic compounds pvpp is often used to fine juice pressed from moldy grapes sometimes a light fining with polyclar can be very effective and produce almost miraculous results at other times this material may not be very productive 
pvpp is an easy material to use the powder is mixed with a small amount of water and then added to the wine dose levels range from 1/4 to 2 grams per gallon about 1 gram per gallon is considered a typical dose this material reacts with the wine very quickly so it can be removed from the wine after just a few hours however polyclar does not settle out of wine very quickly and many winemakers prefer to filter the wine after a pvpp treatment sometimes small amounts of bentonite are used as a topping material to help settle the pvpp particles quickly 
sparkolloid 
sparkolloid is a proprietary material manufactured by scott laboratories it contains a polysaccharide substance dispersed in diatomaceous earth it comes in hot mix and cold mix forms but the hot form is preferred for clarification fining sparkolloid is the material of choice for clarifying white and blush wines sparkolloid is one of the more benign fining materials and when used in reasonable quantities it seldom strips wine flavors or aromas it is also used as a topping material and sparkolloid can be useful following bentonite or carbon treatment 
sparkolloid does have a significant disadvantage it produces very fine lees and the lees settle out of the wine slowly consequently this material should not be used less than 30 days before bottling time or small amounts may precipitate later in the bottles many winemakers allow for an eight week settling time just to be on the safe side 
dose levels range from 1/4 to 1 gram of dry sparkolloid powder per gallon of wine about 1 gram per gallon is considered a nominal dose a solution is made by stirring sparkolloid powder into boiling water after the powder is added the mixture should be boiled for an additional 20 minutes the sparkolloid solution is not allowed to cool the hot solution should be added to the wine and stirred in carefully 
summary 
fining materials are used to remove a specific material from the wine many different materials are used to fine wine and each material has different properties therefore the winemaker must carefully select each material carefully to produce the desired results 
bench testing is done by treating a small quantity of wine with the proposed fining material after an appropriate time the test wine is examined to verify that the desired results have been achieved when the winemaker feels the fining goal has been met in the test sample he adds the correct quantity of the fining material to the main batch 
unsightly protein hazes can form in the bottles unless white and blush wines are hot stabilized bentonite is used to remove excess protein from these wines and all commercial white and blush wines are fined with bentonite 
chapter 15 
clarification

 and  stabilization 

our first impression of any wine is a visual one wine is seen before it is tasted and wine is expected to be brilliantly clear and have an appropriate color the consumer is always disappointed when a wine does not meet these visual expectations even zealous wine advocates shy away from turbid dirty looking wines judges at home wine competitions occasionally face this problem and sometimes real courage is needed to taste a particularly ugly wine 
types of hazes 
most wine haze problems are caused by grape particles and fragments microbes protein tartrate phenolic polymers polysaccharide and metals wine clarity problems are not mysterious and unless a wine has been grossly contaminated by the addition of some foreign material wine haze is normally the result of one or more of these factors sometimes a winemaker will encounter a haze that is particularly difficult to remove but these cases are rare most haze problems are solved by identifying the offending material and then acting accordingly 
particles and fragments 
grape particles seldom cause long term haze problems even the smallest bits and pieces of grape pulp and skins are large enough to settle out of wine in a few weeks however ml fermentation can produce enough carbon dioxide gas to cause a significant turbulence in a small tank and the turbulence prevents the smaller particles from settling out ml fermentation can continue long after the sugar is gone so winemakers check for the presence of carbon dioxide gas to make sure all fermentations have been completed when the gas is gone the particles will settle out and after the wine has been racked a time or two it will be clear and bright 
microbial hazes 
yeast cells are several microns in diameter and if the wine is not disturbed the yeast cells readily settle to the bottom of the container in a few weeks usually a little patience will take care of yeast haze problems but the situation is not so simple with bacterial hazes bacteria are 10 to 100 times smaller than yeast cells and bacteria are so small they never completely settle out of the wine 
large wineries have sophisticated analytical equipment in their testing labs but even then some types of bacteria are difficult to identify and treat fortunately many wine bacteria are sensitive to sulfur dioxide and most bacterial problems can be prevented simply by maintaining the free sulfur dioxide content of stored wine at 30 milligrams per liter once established a bad bacterial haze can be difficult to overcome the infected wine can be pasteurized or the wine can be passed through a sterile membrane filter both techniques are effective and both are common wine industry procedures unfortunately few home winemakers have the sophisticated and expensive equipment needed to apply either of these treatments since gross bacterial infections are difficult to handle home winemakers should maintain strict hygienic winemaking conditions and they should always maintain reasonable amounts 20 to 30 mg/l of free sulfur dioxide in their wines taking these two simple steps will reduce the occurrence of bacterial infections to a very low level sometimes home winemakers can rent sterile filtration equipment and sterile filtration might be a feasible way of saving a particularly pleasing wine nevertheless the equipment and sterilization procedures are complicated for the average home winemaker prevention is the most effective way of dealing with bacterial problems 
protein 
grapes contain small quantities of protein and some varieties sauvignon blanc sometimes contain large amounts protein is carried over from the grapes into the wine during fermentation originally the protein molecules are much too small to be visible in the wine however under certain conditions protein molecules link together polymerize and grow larger after many protein molecules have linked together the protein particles are large enough to be visible and the particles are too large to remain suspended in the wine this growth process is very slow at normal cellar temperatures but when wine becomes warm the protein molecules grow more rapidly at temperatures of about 120 degrees protein molecules can link together and form large particles in a short time 
a bad protein haze is very unsightly in a bottle of white or blush wine the protein particles are light and fluffy and they produce a swirling cloud when the bottle is disturbed when white or blush wines are subjected to warm storage conditions protein hazes can form quickly and all commercial white and blush wines are specifically treated to remove the excess protein before bottling winemakers call protein haze hot instability because warm storage conditions trigger the phenomena a graphic demonstration of hot instability can be easily produced by leaving a bottle of sauvignon blanc in a car trunk on a hot summer day 
excess protein seldom causes stability problems in red wine red wines contain phenolic compounds that react with the protein during primary fermentation and the excess protein precipitates out of the wine white and blush wines contain very little phenolic materials so the winemaker must use a special treatment to remove the excess protein from these wines 
potassium bitartrate 
grapes contain several organic acids including tartaric acid and they contain potassium vines manufacture tartaric acid through the photosynthesis process and the vines obtain potassium from the soil potassium reacts with tartaric acid and forms a material called potassium bitartrate potassium bitartrate is a clear crystalline material and grapes always contain some of this material cooks usually refer to potassium bitartrate as cream of tarter but most winemakers call this material tartrate 
potassium bitartrate has several interesting physical properties 1 only small quantities of this material can be dissolved in grape juice 2 after grape juice ferments and alcohol accumulates even less potassium bitartrate is soluble in the water alcohol mixture 3 the quantity of potassium bitartrate dissolved in wine is strongly dependent upon temperature and cold wine cannot hold as much potassium bitartrate as warm wine 
in combination these three properties produce an interesting winemaking problem generally grape juice contains all the potassium bitartrate it can hold when the grapes are picked alcohol begins to accumulate when the grapes are fermented as the alcohol concentration increases the new wine becomes saturated and potassium bitartrate precipitates out of the wine as fermentation continues more alcohol is produced and more tartrate is forced to precipitate out of wine by the end of fermentation the new wine is over saturated with potassium bitartrate the tartrate continues to drop out of the solution but at normal cellar temperatures tartrate precipitation is very slow often the tartrate crystals continue to precipitate for a year or more so potassium bitartrate causes serious long term stability problems for the wine industry 
the following example illustrates a common tartrate stability problem a new white wine is clarified and aged for several months the wine is then filtered with a 0 45 micron membrane and bottled the newly bottled wine is clear and bright but the wine is still nearly saturated with potassium bitartrate ultimately a consumer puts a bottle of this wine into a refrigerator for a few hours before it is served the wine cools rapidly in the refrigerator and potassium bitartrate precipitates out of the cold wine see property number three above 
as tartrate drops out of solution suspicious looking crystals are formed in the bottle or dense hazes form tartrate hazes are very unsightly and sometimes the consumer mistakes the tartrate crystals in the bottle for glass particles in any case the consumer is unhappy and the winemaker is embarrassed all commercial white and blush wines are cold stabilized sometime during the winemaking process to remove the excess tartrate material before the wine is bottled 
phenolic polymers 
phenolic compounds are present in wine in small amounts the quantity may be small but phenolic materials are very important wine ingredients phenolic compounds are responsible for color bitterness astringency and some odors and flavors many phenolic compounds polymerize just like protein molecules and these phenolic molecules combine and slowly grow larger phenolic molecules carry an electric charge and the molecules repel each other in the wine large phenolic molecules can remain suspended in the wine for a long time because of the electric charges 
since phenolic molecules remain suspended for a long time haze and bottle deposit problems often occur a few months after red wines are bottled unless the excess phenolic material is removed to avoid phenolic problems experienced winemakers remove excessive quantities of phenolic materials from red wines by fining or filtration any protein fining material such as gelatin casein egg white or isinglass can remove phenolic materials from wine and many red wines are lightly fined with egg whites or gelatin several weeks before bottling time the quantity of fining material used is small so the fining treatment does not alter other wine characteristics significantly practically all commercial red wines receive a light protein fining or a tight pad filtration to reduce bottle deposits 
making red wines completely phenolic stable is not practical and most red wines will show some bottle deposit when several years old phenolic haze problems rarely occur in white or blush wines these wines receive practically no skin contact so they contain very little phenolic material 
polysaccharides 
polysaccharides are very large molecules consisting of many simple sugar molecules monosaccharides linked together pectin and gums are common examples of polysaccharides pectin is the material that makes jam and jelly solidify and pectin often produces hazes in fruit wines however pectin hazes are seldom a serious problem in wines made from grapes because grapes contain a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down the large pectin molecules into smaller molecules that cause little trouble 
when they do occur pectin or gum hazes can be difficult to remove from wine these large polysaccharide molecules often carry electric charges and the charges help hold the molecules in suspension most fining materials used for wine clarification are not very effective in removing this type of haze because of the chemical nature of these materials filtration is not always an effective way of removing pectin hazes because filter pads are plugged quickly by pectin and gums and trying to filter wine with a bad pectin haze often becomes a frustrating and costly undertaking 
winemakers often use pectic enzymes instead of trying to remove pectin hazes by fining or filtration pectic enzymes are available commercially and they are added to the juice or the wine to break down the large troublesome pectin molecules alcohol interferes with enzyme action to some extent so sometimes pectic enzymes are more efficient when added to juice before fermentation is started occasionally just chilling the wine to a low temperature 28 degrees will cause a bad pectin haze to speed out as if by magic 
metals 
fifty years ago most winemaking equipment was made of iron or brass wine acids are strong enough to dissolve tiny amounts of these metals and in the past iron and copper hazes were common problems throughout the wine industry several proprietary fining materials were developed specifically to remove these excess metals from wine unfortunately the effective products were based on poisonous cyanide compounds and great care and much testing was required when these products were used in recent years the prevalent use of stainless steel and plastic materials has virtually eliminated metal haze problems 
the clarification process 
large quantities of carbon dioxide gas are produced during primary fermentation and considerable turbulence in the wine is produced as the bubbles rise to the surface when fermentation is finished bubbles are no longer produced and the wine becomes still when the wine is still gravity slowly pulls the suspended material to the bottom of the container settling time depends on the size of the suspended material and smaller particles require more time to settle than larger particles pulp and skin fragments settle out of small containers in just a few days yeast cells are much smaller and a week or more is usually required for spent yeast cells to fall 24 inches bacteria are 10 to 100 times smaller than yeast cells and bacteria are so small they never completely settle out of the wine 
new wines contain many different types of suspended particles and these particles often have an electrical charge the charges act just like magnets and the like electrical charges repel each other then even larger particles may never settle out of the wine until the electrical charges are neutralized 
racking 
the muck that slowly accumulates on the bottom of wine containers is called lees clean wine is separated from the lees by a decanting process called racking after wine is racked two or three times it becomes clean clear and bottle bright besides clarifying wine racking helps remove other unwanted materials so racking also contributes to long term wine stability small containers like 5 gallon carboys are usually racked by siphoning the wine off the lees with a piece of clear plastic tubing barrels and drums are often racked with a small pump and plastic tubing wineries use powerful electric transfer pumps and large diameter hoses made from food grade materials to rack their large stainless steel wine tanks 
white wines are normally racked off the gross yeast lees shortly after the finish of alcoholic fermentation these wines are racked a second time after they have been hot and cold stabilized red wines are often left on their gross lees until ml fermentation is finished they are then racked for the first time red wines are usually racked two more times the first year and then at six month intervals most winemakers rack wines promptly a week or so after a fining treatment 
fining 
most white and blush wines will be almost clear after being hot stabilized with bentonite but additional clarification steps are usually necessary to produce a bright clear wine these additional clarification steps might consist of fining with sparkolloid or gelatin/kieselsol or filtering the wine through a course pad or cartridge commercial wineries use large filters to clarify their wines because filtration is safer and quicker when the proper equipment is available small wineries often clean up their wines by fining before any filtration is done to reduce production cost most home winemakers do not have filtration capability so they rely solely on fining to clarify their wines 
something is amiss when a white or blush wine does not come clear after being hot stabilized with bentonite and then fined with sparkolloid excessive fining or filtering can devastate wine quality so care must be taken when attempting to clarify a stubborn wine the first step is to identify the specific problem second appropriate steps should be taken to eliminate the problem and then the wine clarification and stabilization process can be continued 
sound red wines come clear without any fining or filtration treatments because the tannin in red wine acts as a fining agent red wines are usually clear and bright after being racked a couple of times and aged a few months although clarity is seldom a problem in red wine long term bottle stability is always an issue red wines generally produce significant amounts of bottle deposit unless they are filtered or lightly fined with a protein material light fining or filtration with a medium pad will not significantly alter flavors or bouquets but either procedure can effectively reduce bottle deposits the bottle deposits are unsightly so most commercial red wines are stabilized by either fining and/or filtration before they are bottled 
filtration 
today consumers demand brilliantly clear white and blush wines unfortunately maximum wine clarity is difficult to produce by fining alone in addition fining wine is time consuming produces lees and always involves some risk consequently filtration plays an important role in the clarification of commercially produced wines pad and frame type filters and cartridge type filters are extensively used throughout the wine industry both styles of filters have advantages and disadvantages pad and frame type filters are best suited for filtering large quantities of wine filter pads are inexpensive but the frame assembly is very expensive pad and frame filters are best suited for commercial applications because of the large initial capital investment home winemakers often use cartridge type filters because inexpensive plastic filter housings are available in most hardware stores filter cartridges are more expensive than filter pads per gallon of wine filtered however since home winemakers produce smaller quantities of wine the cost of filter cartridges is not prohibitive both types of filters are discussed in greater detail in the following chapter 
wine stabilization 
wine is often exposed to considerable heat when shipped long distances in the summer time most white and blush wines are chilled to about 50 degrees for several hours before they are served practically all commercial wines are specifically treated to make them stable and after stabilization wine appearance or quality will not be altered by reasonable temperature extremes most commercial winemakers consider wine stable if the wine does not show significant changes when exposed to storage temperatures ranging from 40 to 100 degrees 
stabilizing a light fruity white table wine is not trivial light fruity wines can be damaged easily by over processing excessive handling or oxidation and producing good long term bottle stability without reducing the quality of a delicate wine requires considerable winemaking skill 
occasionally a winemaker bottles a wine without doing stability tests the wine has been brilliantly clear for several months so the winemaker assumes the wine is stable a few weeks after bottling the wine develops a bad haze or drops an ugly sediment in the bottles now the winemaker has little recourse because un bottling treating and re bottling would destroy wine quality bottling unstable wine can be a discouraging event for any winemaker and it can be an economic disaster for a commercial producer 
cold stabilization 
practically all new wine contains excessive quantities of potassium bitartrate and the tartrate precipitates out of cold wine as crystals or hazes all white and blush wines require cold stabilization before bottling and most commercial producers cold stabilize their red wines as well wine can be effectively cold stabilized in several ways a few large wineries use ion exchange columns to remove potassium from the wine ion exchange columns are filled with resin and work on the same principle as domestic water softeners this type of wine cold stabilization requires large expensive equipment and a trained chemist is needed to establish the proper operation of the exchange column however once the equipment is operating the ion exchange method is a fast and economical cold stabilization process unfortunately wine quality can be reduced when the ion exchange method is used inappropriately 
smaller wineries use a much simpler method to stabilize their wines the wine is cooled to about 27 degrees and held at this low temperature for a week or two until the excess potassium bitartrate precipitates this method of cold stabilizing wine also has advantages and disadvantages low temperatures are beneficial to new wine in several ways besides causing the potassium bitartrate to precipitate the cold temperature helps other unwanted materials settle out of the wine sometimes suspended pectin and gums can be removed by chilling the wine in addition several days of low temperature storage can be helpful in developing long term wine stability 
unless the wine is carefully handled considerable oxygen can be absorbed while the wine is cold the oxidation problem can be managed by purging wine containers with an inert gas keeping the containers completely full and by maintaining adequate levels of sulfur dioxide in the wine the high cost of energy needed to operate the large capacity refrigeration system raises production costs and many wineries use specially insulated tanks to stabilize their wines 
tartrate crystals also form in red wines but the dark color obscures small deposits of tartrate crystals red wines are not chilled before serving so a haze seldom forms often the tartrate crystals in red wines are found adhering to the cork and the crystals are removed when the cork is pulled tartrate crystals are not so noticeable in red wine so a few smaller wineries and many home winemakers do not bother to cold stabilize their red wines however most commercially produced red wines are cold stabilized before being bottled 
hot stabilization 
commercial wine is shipped long distances in warm weather and under these conditions protein instability causes hazes to form in white or blush wine protein hazes are very unsightly and the wine industry considers excess protein removal an indispensable treatment for all white and blush wines excess protein is not difficult to remove from most wines but sometimes sauvignon blanc wines can be difficult to stabilize completely without damaging aromas and flavors the standard treatment for all new white and blush wines is to fine with bentonite the bentonite fining can be done anytime during the winemaking process but the procedure is more efficient when the bentonite fining is done after the new wine has been rough filtered nevertheless many winemakers find it more convenient to stabilize their wines by removing the protein earlier in the winemaking process see below 
bentonite additions rang from one to ten pounds per thousand gallons of wine however high dose rates can strip desirable flavors so bench testing should always be done to measure the minimum quantity of bentonite needed the treated wine is allowed to settle for a week or so before it is racked 
tannin in red wine reacts with protein and causes the protein to precipitate out of the wine during fermentation little protein remains at bottling time so protein hazes are seldom a problem in red wine 
combined hot & cold stabilization 
all white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization treatments and some winemakers combine both stabilization procedures into a single operation to reduce handling first the wine is fined with bentonite and then the wine is immediately chilled to about 27 degrees the wine is held at the cold temperature for a week or so while the tartrate precipitates when the excess tartrate is gone the cold wine is racked or filtered off the bentonite and tartrate lees this combined procedure has some advantages the tartrate crystals settle on top of the fluffy bentonite lees forming a crusty layer and the wine is much easier to rack off the compacted lees both procedures are accomplished in a single winemaking operation so labor is reduced wine manipulation is reduced and the risk of wine oxidation is reduced 
finishing white wines 
many of the desirable qualities of light bodied white table wines come from the characteristics of the grapes these wines are only a few months old when bottled because lengthy aging destroys the desirable fruit qualities for example light fruity riesling wine is often finished in the following way after fermentation the free sulfur dioxide content is adjusted to about 30 milligrams per liter and then the wine is hot and cold stabilized after cold stabilization the acid level is adjusted if necessary and the wine is allowed to rest for a few weeks then the wine is critically evaluated and any other necessary adjustments are made if large adjustments were made the winemaker would test the wine again for both hot and cold stability 
at bottling time the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine is raised to about 30 milligrams per liter riesling wine normally contains residual sugar any residual sugar may cause fermentation to restart so a sterile filter would be used to remove all of the yeast cells from the wine when it is bottled most home winemakers do not have sterile filtration equipment so they use a different method to leave residual sugar in wine home winemakers add potassium sorbate to the wine the sorbate stabilizes the wine by preventing the yeast cells from

above following cold stabilization most 
wines 
high quality red wines are barrel aged for 12 to 24 months during this lengthy aging period the wine is tasted and tested periodically and the free sulfur dioxide is maintained at a reasonable level 20 to 25 mg/l the barrels are topped up each time the wine is tested after the gross lees are removed red wines are racked two or three times a year if the wine seems too astringent the winemaker might use a gelatin or egg whites to reduce the tannin content at the end of the aging period the winemaker tastes and critically reviews the wine for any needed corrections and the free sulfur dioxide level is raised to about 30 milligrams per liter the wine is then filtered and bottled high quality red wines are often aged in the bottle from six months to several years during this time the wine develops bottle bouquet 
experience required 
many factors are involved in producing high quality wine and considerable judgment must be exercised throughout the finishing process from the time the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled many winemaking decisions must be made the time wine spends in the barrels the frequency and method of racking how much tannin should be left in the wine etc etc all contribute to the ultimate quality of the product making high quality wine requires experience and good judgment and this kind of preparation is difficult to get by reading books 
summary 
wine enjoyment is strongly influenced by first impressions and our first impression with any wine is visual consequently clarity and stability are extremely important to both homemade and commercial wines 
practically all wines can be clarified stabilized and prepared for bottling using standard winemaking practices these procedures include cooling the wine to cold temperatures fining the wine with suitable materials and using appropriate filtration methods 
all white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization and most commercial red wines are cold stabilized although they are perfectly clear red wines can throw a noticeable deposit after bottling unless they have been stabilized by fining filtering or bulk aged for an unusually long time 
many factors are involved in producing high quality wine and time effort and good judgment are required 
chapter 16 

wine filtration 
most red wines self clarify in a few months and they usually do not require special clarification treatments even when red wines are not brilliantly clear the dark color obscures any slight cloudiness white and blush wines are different here any lack of clarity will be painfully evident and most white or blush wines require one or more specific clarification steps 
cloudy wine is difficult to sell and sometimes getting a white or blush wine clear and bottle bright without using some kind of filtration is difficult consequently practically all commercially produced white and blush wines are filtered before they are bottled of course home winemakers always prefer to produce brilliantly clear wine but such clarity is seldom essential unless the home winemaker actively participates in homemade wine competitions 
filter technology 
in the past thirty years great strides have been made in filter technology now a variety of filters are available for removing microorganisms and these filters can produce sterile wine when used properly molecular sieve filters can remove color and other large phenolic molecules from wine over the past few years reverse osmosis filtration techniques have been developed specifically for the wine industry these sophisticated ultra filtration techniques can selectively remove acetic acid and other small molecules from wine 
desirability 
sterile filtration equipment gives wineries a very useful production tool practically all of the yeast cells can be removed from wine by simple inexpensive filtration off dry and sweet wines can be bottled with little worry the residual sugar will start fermenting and wine quality does not suffer significantly when the filtration is done properly 
in the past wines containing excessive quantities of acetic acid were difficult to handle often these wines were added to sound fermentations in small quantities or acetic wines were sent to the still house to be converted into alcohol now acetic acid can be effectively removed by ultra filtration apparatus and many other defective wines can be salvaged using modern filtration techniques in addition the new filter technologies have significantly reduced wine production costs and the quality of inexpensive jug wines has improved significantly even so extreme levels of filtration are not necessary or desirable for normal wines many winemakers believe the less treatment a healthy wine receives the better the quality of the finished product these winemakers pursue a minimum filtration philosophy for the production of fine wines but 
minimum filtration does not mean zero filtration producing brilliantly clear white or blush table wines without using some reasonable level of filtration is difficult and sometimes impossible 
filter assemblies 
pad type filter assemblies are used by practically all commercial wineries normally pads are made of depth type materials but some manufacturers produce special adapters that allow membrane filter media to be used in their pad type filter assemblies cartridge type filter assemblies are used by commercial wineries and by many home winemakers both depth cartridges and membrane cartridges are made to fit standard cartridge housings each filter material and each filter type is most efficient when used for the intended purpose so the manufacturers recommendations should be followed 
pad filters 
pad type filter assemblies consist of a stack of ridged plastic or stainless steel frames held together by a powerful clamping mechanism each frame is separated by filter pads the wine flows into half the frames through the filter pads and then out of the other frames pad type filter assemblies are made of stainless steel and molded plastic the clamping mechanisms are large and the materials are expensive in addition the frames contain many ridges so they are difficult to manufacture consequently pad type filter assemblies are expensive however when large quantities of wine are filtered filter pads become quite economical so commercial wineries use pad type filters 
cartridge filters 
cartridge type filters consist of filter materials made in the shape of a hollow cylinder the cylindrical filter cartridge is housed in a plastic or stainless steel container wine flows into the housing and through the filter cartridge from the outside to the inside after passing through the filter material the wine flows out of the housing both depth type filter cartridges and membrane type filter cartridges are available cartridge type filter housings made of plastic are used extensively for domestic water filtration these plastic housings are made in large quantities and they are inexpensive filter systems can be built from inexpensive plastic housings simply so home winemakers often use cartridge type filter assemblies 
filter mechanisms 
filtration can be accomplished by two different mechanisms unwanted particles are attracted and entangled in a porous filter material in the first mechanism this type of filtration is an adsorption process and electrostatic and adhesion forces are responsible for trapping and retaining the particles the pathways and cavities in the filter material are much larger than the trapped particles this kind of filtration is called depth filtration because the particles are trapped within the thickness of the filter material the second filter mechanism is a simple sieve process here the liquid is forced through a membrane containing many small holes or pores pore size is large enough to allow desirable smaller particles to pass through the membrane but the pores are small enough to block the larger unwanted particles filter membranes are made of special plastic materials the plastic is very thin and the pore diameters can be made very small membrane filters are usually called sterile filters when the pores are small enough to remove wine microbes 
depth filters 
depth filters are used to remove grape fragments tartrate crystals yeast cells and general debris from wine depth filters are made by compressing and bonding fibrous substances into a mat or pad in the past asbestos fibers were used extensively but modern depth filters are made from specially prepared cellulose the cellulose fibers are specifically processed to give them a net residual electrical charge the long path lengths created by the overlaid fibers trap the particles within the body of the pad smaller size particles are retained when the pads are made tighter and more dense however liquid flow through the pad becomes 
slower as the density of the pad increases rates of flow for typical 
commercial filter pads are shown in table 12 the rates of flow are for 
water and they are given in gallons per minute for a one square meter of 
pad area at a pressure of 10 pounds per square inch filter flow

depth filter pads are manufactured in several sizes and in bulk eight by

rates through filter pads 
washing depth filters before filtering wine is a standard practice washing removes any contaminates bad odors or off tastes that may be present the standard washing procedure is to assemble the filter system and circulate a 1% citric acid in water solution through the system then the system is drained and clean water is circulated after a short rinse the water coming out of the filter is tasted if the water has a paper taste washing is continued 
porosity 
depth filters can be purchased with porosities ranging from 50 microns to about 0 2 microns two different scales are used to rate the porosity of depth filters and a large difference in particle retention ability exists between the two scales nominal filters are rated using a 50 percent criterion for example a 1 micron nominal filter will pass about half the 1 micron particles present absolute filters use a more stringent standard absolute filters use a 10 out of a million criterion a 1 micron absolute filter only passes ten 1micron particles out of a million the other 999 990 1 micron particles are retained by the filter obviously a 1 micron nominal filter is far more porous than a 1 micron absolute filter filter pads are usually rated using the absolute scale depth type cartridge filters are rated using the nominal scale unless the rating is specified as absolute 
membrane filters 
membrane filters work in a different way the filter material is a thin flexible plastic membrane a special manufacturing technique is used to produce the plastic and the plastic sheet contains an enormous numberof very small holes a membrane filter acts just like a sieve particles larger than the hole size are mechanically blocked at the surface of the membrane but smaller particles pass right through the holes 
filter membranes are made from several plastic materials including polypropylene cellophane and polyester 
 since the membrane is very thin additional mechanical support must be provided and filter membranes are placed on top of a backing structure to provide greater strength membrane filter cartridges are more expensive than depth filter cartridges because of more complicated construction methods and more costly materials 
the porosity of membrane filters is rated using the absolute scale and porosities are designated by the equivalent size of the holes for wine industry use the three most popular membrane filter porosities use 0 65 0 45 and 0 2 micron hole diameters because of the simple sieve action membrane filters are easily plugged or blocked to reduce plugging all wine going into a tight membrane filter must be filtered with a 1 micron absolute depth filter first membrane filters can be washed and reverse flushed to remove some of the blocking particles and these filters can be reused several times 
membrane filters are used to sterilize wine just before bottling a membrane filter with a 0 45 micron absolute rating will remove all wine yeast and bacteria from the wine membrane filters are commonly used in all commercial wineries and 0 45 micron membrane filters are often mounted on the bottling line just ahead of the bottle filler 
filters for home winemakers 
a filter assembly suitable for the home winemaker can be easily made from standard 10 inch housings these filter housings are used to improve drinking water quality they are made of plastic and they can be purchased for about 25 two plastic tubing fittings 2 are needed to connect plastic tubing to the inlet and outlet ports in the housing this type of filter assembly can be used with any small transfer pump that can deliver a pressure of at least 10 pounds per square inch alternatively a gas transfer system can be used to move the wine through the filter 
one micron nominal depth type cartridges cost about 4 and they are suitable for rough filtration of all types of wine either 0 5 micron nominal depth cartridges costing about 7 or 0 2 micron nominal depth cartridges costing 20 can be used for polish filtration a 0 2 micron nominal cartridge is preferred for final filtration of white and blush wines cartridge life can be extended by carefully cleaning up the wine by fining and racking before it is filtered 
this type of cartridge filter assembly can produce excellent wine clarity and it gives the small producer a very practical filtration system best of all the filter can be easily assembled from standard parts for a few dollars 
summary 
getting white and blush wines sparkling bright is difficult without using some kind of filtration but excessive filtration can strip desirable aromas flavors and color home winemakers often use cartridge type filters and these filters can produce excellent wine clarity 
commercial wineries use sterile filtration techniques when they bottle wines containing residual sugar the filter removes all of the yeast cells and prevents fermentation from occurring after the wine is bottled 
chapter 17 

bottling 
light white table wines and most blush wines are bottled a few months after primary fermentation these wines are valued for their young fruity characteristics and they do not benefit from aging and light heavier bodied white table wines such as chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are usually given several months of bulk aging these heavier white wines and light fruity red wines are usually consumed when one or more years old heavier style red wines are usually given one to three years of bulk aging before they are bottled and then the highest quality red wines are often several years old before they are consumed 
pre bottling adjustments 
bottling is the culmination of the entire winemaking process wine is always oxidized to some extent when the bottles are filled and experienced winemakers take special care throughout the bottling operation oxidation reduces table wine quality so excessive foaming and splashing should be avoided whenever possible although bottling may seem like a simple procedure several important issues need to be considered before the bottles can be filled 
clarity 
all wines must be brilliantly clear before bottling most sound red wines are clear and bright when they are several months old and clarity is seldom a problem for these wines on the other hand practically all white and blush wines and most rose wines require special clarification treatments these wines generally need fining and tight filtration before they attain adequate clarity 
stability 
besides being clear wines must also be stable before bottling blending should be done well before bottling time and the winemaker should observe the new blend for several weeks to be sure the new blend is stable 
 commercial wineries test to be sure their red wines are cold stable but most home winemakers do not bother all white and blush wines should be cold stabilized and these wines may require an additional cold stabilization treatment if much tartaric acid is added late in the winemaking process sometimes a white or blush wine needs a small acid addition just before bottling to improve acid balance citric acid is often used for this purpose and additional cold stabilization is often not needed when moderate amounts of citric acid are used 
all white and blush wines should be tested for stability before bottling wine can be checked for cold stability by placing a small sample in the refrigerator after 48 hours the wine sample is removed from the refrigerator and set aside for several hours when the sample reaches room temperature the wine is carefully examined for cloudiness or deposits 
 white and blush wines can be checked for hot stability by holding a wine sample at 120 degrees after 48 hours at the high temperature the wine is allowed to stand over night at room temperature then the wine sample is carefully inspected for protein haze or sediment 
free sulfur dioxide 
the free sulfur dioxide content of all wines should be measured and raised to about 30 milligrams per liter a few days before bottling bottling wine with less than 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide will result in a short lived product 
residual sugar 
wines containing more than 0 2 percent residual sugar are not biologically stable and these wines can start fermenting anytime most wines are a complete loss when fermentation restarts after the wine is bottled to avoid such catastrophic losses additional precautions are always required when off dry or sweet wines are bottled generally four methods can be used to deal with the residual sugar problem 1 the wine can be pasteurized to kill the yeast 2 ethanol can be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine above 18% 3 sterile filtration can be used to remove all of the yeast cells when the wine is bottled 4 a special material can be added to prevent yeast in the wine from fermenting the residual sugar 
pasteurization reduces wine quality so this process is seldom used for quality table wines adding ethanol is suitable for dessert wines but additional alcohol is seldom desirable in table wines commercial wineries use a sterile filtration process when wines containing residual sugar are bottled but most home winemakers do not have access to sterile filtration equipment home winemakers usually add potassium sorbate to prevent fermentation in off dry or sweet wines 
potassium sorbate 
potassium sorbate does not interact with the residual sugar in any way sorbate prevents fermentation by acting on the yeast cells but it does not kill the yeast sorbic acid passes through the cell membrane easily and the yeast cell is prevented from generating a new bud when enough sorbic acid molecules have accumulated in other words sorbic acid prevents yeast cells from reproducing but it does not stop yeast from fermenting sugar 
sometimes potassium sorbate does not prevent fermentation from restarting because the wine contains too many viable yeast cells when potassium sorbate and sugar are added to a wine containing many viable yeast cells the sorbate prevents the yeast from reproducing but enough yeast cells may be present all ready to ferment the additional sugar then fermentation often occurs after the wine is bottled the wine is spoiled and the winemaker is unhappy 
a different situation exists when sorbate and sugar are added to a well clarified wine the clean wine contains very few yeast cells the sorbic acid prevents the small number of existing yeast cells from reproducing and the added sugar is unaffected even if fermentation occurred only a tiny amount of the added sugar would be lost because only a few yeast cells are present in the wine in time the few active yeast cells in the wine grow old and gradually die after a few months the wine contains practically all of the added sugar and very few viable yeast cells 
using just the right amount of sorbate can be a problem wine flavor can be adversely affected when too much sorbate is used but the wine may restart fermentation if too little sorbate is added the sorbate needed to keep yeast cells from reproducing depends upon several wine properties the normal dose is about one gram of sorbate for each gallon of wine one gram per gallon is equivalent to about 2 level teaspoons per 5 gallons of wine wines with a high alcohol content low ph and 30 to 50 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide present require less potassium sorbate 
an additional problem sometimes develops when potassium sorbate is added to wines low in sulfur dioxide 
 large bacterial populations can exist in wines low in sulfur dioxide sometimes the bacteria in the wine can react with the sorbic acid and a strange geranium like odor is produced 
large quantities of potassium sorbate were used by commercial wineries to stabilize off dry wines before practical sterile filtration equipment became available however sorbic acid is not widely used today because of the potential flavor problems and the high cost of potassium sorbate now sterile filtration is the preferred treatment and few commercial wineries use potassium sorbate potassium sorbate is not a very stable material unopened containers have a reasonable shelf life but after the package is opened potassium sorbate can deteriorate rapidly 
filling bottles 
new glass bottles leave the factory in a sterile condition however new bottles often contain carton dust and even new glass should be rinsed bottles stored for extended times should always be rinsed before filling some home winemakers turn up the hot water heater a few hours before starting to bottle wine then clean previously washed used bottles are rinsed with very hot water just before filling other winemakers rinse each bottle with a sulfur dioxide solution the sulfur dioxide solution is made by mixing 1/4 tsp of sulfite powder and tsp of citric acid in 750 ml of clean cold water this sulfite solution is strong enough to sterilize the bottles but care must be taken to drain the bottles completely 
plastic milk crates are a convenient way of handling glass while bottling milk crates hold about 20 bottles and they are easy to keep clean if one end of the crate rests on a block of wood the empty bottles will be held on a slant and the angle makes filling easier 
wine is always exposed to a significant amount of air when the bottle is filled and a bottle filler of some kind should be used when bottling to reduce this oxidation most home winemakers siphon the wine into the bottles with a piece of clear plastic hose fitted with a plastic wand type bottle filler a simple bottle filler has a small valve on the end of a rigid plastic tube the plastic tube is placed in the empty bottle and the valve opens when it contacts the bottom of the bottle wine begins to flow when the valve opens and the bottle is filled from the bottom little splashing occurs when filling is done slowly and wine oxidation is held to a minimum 
small two or three spout gravity type bottle fillers specifically designed for home winemakers can be purchased for about one hundred dollars and these fillers are very convenient moderate quantities of wine are made gravity fillers are much faster than wand type fillers and smaller commercial wineries often use larger multiple spout gravity fillers a gravity filler consists of a small tank to hold the wine a float valve assembly that keeps the wine in the tank at a constant level and filler spouts tanks on small two and three spout machines can be filled by siphoning with large diameter tubing tanks on machines employing several spouts must be filled with a small transfer pump operation of gravity type bottle fillers is quite simple the operator places an empty bottle on an empty spout and the machine starts filling the new bottle filling continues unattended while the operator removes other full bottles and places empty bottles on the spouts when the new bottles become full the machine automatically stops filling once the filler is adjusted properly all of the bottles will be filled to the same uniform level little spillage occurs and if the operator is careful the outside surfaces of the bottles remain clean and dry although these little machines are simple in design they are surprisingly fast most gravity bottle fillers can fill two bottles per minute for each spout for example a machine with four spouts can fill more than eight bottles a minute and one person is kept quite busy changing the bottles 
bottles should be filled until less than 1/4 inch space exists between the top of the wine and the bottom of the cork most wand type bottle fillers leave too much air space in the bottle some winemakers prefer to fill and cork one bottle at a time other winemakers prefer to fill several bottles and then cork the lot in any event leaving full bottles of wine open for long periods is not a good practice 
corking 
standard wine corks are sold in large sealed polyethylene bags containing one thousand corks the corks are sterilized with sulfur dioxide gas when packaged and the corks remain in a sterile condition until the bag is opened the water content of the corks is carefully adjusted just before packaging and the humidity in the bags is carefully controlled corks taken from a sealed bag are soft pliable and resilient they can be driven easily and the soft pliable corks quickly conform to the neck of the bottle and form a tight seal 
dry corks should be driven into the bottle whenever possible but many small hand corking machines cannot adequately compress hard dry corks then the winemaker has little recourse and softening the corks is necessary the normal procedure is to soak hard corks in cold water until they become soft enough to drive with the corker available a pinch of sulfite can be added to the water to help sterilize the corks as they are soaking very wet corks are undesirable because excessive cork water will be left when the corks are driven into the bottle cork water can be avoided by soaking the corks for a few hours and then the corks are covered with a clean cloth and drained overnight 
corks can be quickly softened and probably sterilized in a microwave oven however corks burn easily so some practice may be needed first the corks are rinsed in clean water and then sealed a plastic zip lock storage bag the sealed bag is then placed in a microwave oven some experimentation with the time and power settings will probably be necessary 
corking machines should be adjusted so the top of the cork is set just below the lip of the bottle spilled wine should be removed from the outside surface of the bottles when the corking operation is completed because wine left on the glass makes labels difficult to apply in addition mold often grows on the spilled wine and after a few weeks an unsightly residue can form on the bottle 
labels 
all wine should have a label permanently attached to each bottle producing custom wine labels with a home computer is easy and fun if a scanner and a color printer are available a variety of art work can be incorporated into the label design and very professional looking labels can be produced easily some glues wrinkle light weight papers so labels are best printed on medium weight paper some bond papers seem to work well papers can be tested by wetting one side of a sheet with water and then carefully observing the paper for a few minutes papers that stretch and wrinkle excessively will probably will not be suitable for labels layout 4 6 or 8 labels on standard 8 5 x 11 inch paper if the layout is carefully done the labels will be easy to cut with a paper cutter and little paper will be wasted a few extra labels should be made when the labels are printed the extra labels can be pasted on the cartons to identify the contents and the labels give case goods a professional look 
capsules and labels can be applied when the bottles are clean and dry home winemakers often use an inexpensive short bristled 1 inch brush to apply glue to labels white elmers glue works well with heavy weight papers unfortunately this glue is water based and it may shrink or wrinkle some types of papers 
the following procedure works well for labeling small quantities by hand cut a piece of cardboard a little smaller than the label place the label face down on the cardboard and apply the glue with the brush apply the glued label to the bottle and quickly smooth out any wrinkles try to place the label in the proper position the first time to avoid smearing the bottle with wet glue clean the brush and glue container with warm soapy water when finished a glue stick is very convenient when just a few bottles are being labeled 
when labeling short runs commercial wineries use a label paster to apply just the right amount of glue to the back surface of plain paper labels these machines apply glue quickly and easily and they save a great deal of time unfortunately small pasting machines are expensive new machines cost 600 or 700 second hand machines are in great demand and they are very hard to find 
capsules 
most home winemakers and many commercial wineries use plastic capsules plastic capsules can be obtained in a variety of colors and they can be custom printed plastic capsules are inexpensive and they provide an attractive finished look to any bottle of wine push on capsules are made of heavy weight plastic material and many home winemakers prefer this type of capsule because they are easy to apply the capsule is simply pushed onto the neck of the bottle 
unlike push on capsules heat shrink type capsules are made from thin plastic material they are available in a greater range of colors and finishes and they are slightly less expensive heat shrink capsules are placed over the neck of the bottle and then heat is applied to shrink the plastic material tightly to the bottle large wineries pass the bottles through a heat tunnel to shrink the capsules in place home winemakers use electric heat guns or they shrink the capsule by dipping the neck of the bottle in boiling water 
bottle aging 

time is required to age wine properly although considerable research has been done no practical way has yet been found to speed up the wine aging process wine ages in two different ways and each type of aging changes the wine in a different way bulk aging takes place in large storage containers and small amounts of air are always present bottle aging takes place after the wine is bottled here no air is present and oxygen is not involved 
most high quality dark red table wines are bulk aged from one to three years after bottling these wines are aged in the bottle for a year or more to develop a bottle bouquet very tannic red wines often require several years of bottle aging to reach maturity heavier white wines are usually bulk aged for several months and then aged in the bottle for an additional time aging in the bottle is best accomplished by placing the bottles on their sides in a cool dark quiet place 
novice winemakers sometimes become very enthusiastic about their first few winemaking efforts and they often consume their wines too early two cases of wine can be consumed in a short time and many new winemakers exhaust their supply before the wine ever approaches maturity this is one argument against making wine in five gallon water bottles a 15 gallon beer keg holds six cases and this is about the smallest size container suitable for home wine production of course five gallon glass bottles are handy for storing leftover wine 
summary 
dirty wine bottles are a potential source of contamination in the home winery dirty bottles should be washed and then placed in clean cartons the cartons of clean bottles should then be stored in a clean dry place 
all wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before it is bottled any blending should be done several weeks before bottling time early blending allows the winemaker to check the wine for several weeks to make sure the new blend is stable before bottling time 
wines containing more than 1/4 percent residual sugar can restart fermenting anytime and these wines must be treated in some way to insure bottle stability home winemakers often use potassium sorbate to prevent fermentation in off dry or sweet wines the right amount of sorbate must be added and wines treated with sorbate should also contain at least 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide 
oxidation is the most common fault found in homemade wines and some wine oxidation always occurs during bottling a bottle filler of some kind should be used and the bottles should be filled slowly from the bottom with a minimum of splashing and bubbling corks should be set flush or slightly below the lip of the bottle all bottled wine should have an appropriate label to identify the contents custom wine labels are easy to make using a home computer

red wine 

 a case history 
carignane grapes are widely grown in france spain california italy and chile carignane is not a well known variety because it is seldom bottled as a varietal wine however carignane grapes produce more red wine than any other grape variety carignane wine is often blended with wines made from other grapes varieties because it is astringent in france carignane wine is the primary component of vin de pays in california it is the major component in hearty burgundy and in most other red jug wines sometimes carignane grapes are called poor mans grapes because carignane produces such large quantities of unremarkable red table wine 
wine made from carignane grown in southern california is often lacking in color however these carignane wines can be quite astringent so the winemaker must handle the primary fermentation carefully when properly fermented and aged in wood for a few months carignane can produce a robust almost friendly red wine 
obtaining grapes 
a local grape grower was contacted the third week in june 1993 arrangements were made to purchase a half ton of carignane grapes for 125 in early october the grower left a message saying the carignane fruit was ripe he said his crew would start picking at daybreak the following saturday and the grapes could be picked up any time after 6 30 a m 
finding the block of carignane vines in the dark was difficult but the darkness did not bother the picking crew the bed of a pickup truck was lined with a large sheet of 4 mil polyethylene and a half ton of carignane grapes was dumped directly into the bed of the truck the grapes were loaded by 6 45 a m they had been off the vines for just a few minutes and the grapes felt cold 
grape processing 
crushing started shortly after 8 00 a m a small power crusher stemmer was placed on top of a half ton plastic fruit bin and the crusher and bin were carefully washed and drained the truck was backed close to the crusher stemmer and the grapes were unloaded with a long handled fork directly from the truck into the crusher stemmer thirty five milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide were added as the grapes were being crushed the fruit bin was about 2/3 full when all of the grapes had been crushed crushing including washing the equipment before and after took about an hour 
testing fruit 
after the equipment had been washed a small sample of juice was tested the juice was measured with a short range hydrometer and the sugar was 23 8 brix the titratable acid was 0 56 percent and the ph was 3 73 the measured data showed the sugar content was fine however the acid content of the grapes was low and the ph of the juice was too high in previous years carignane grapes from the same vineyard always had ta values ranging from 0 55 to 0 60 and a ph of about 3 8 so the low acidity was not a great surprise 
adjust fruit 
about seven ounces of tartaric acid was dissolved in a little water and added to the grapes after the acid addition the titratable acid measured 0 67 percent and the ph value of the juice had dropped to 3 64 grapes from this vineyard had been slow to ferment in previous years and the juice was considered low in nitrogen four ounces of diammonium phosphate were dissolved in a little water and the dap solution was stirred into the fruit to give the yeast a little extra nitrogen 
add yeast 
after lunch a 500 gram package of dry pasteur red yeast was opened and 120 grams of dry yeast were weighed out the temperature of 800 milliliters of water was adjusted to 98 degrees and the dry yeast granules were slowly stirred into the warm water the yeast was stirred several times until the mixture became smooth and creamy after standing for about 25 minutes the rehydrated yeast was added to the crushed carignane grapes 
fermentation 
the grapes showed definite signs of fermentation the following morning by evening a cap had formed and the cap was gently punched down for the first time for the next several days the cap was punched down three or four times each day fermentation was monitored carefully each afternoon the temperature was measured and the sugar content was checked with a hydrometer juice was tasted for astringency and carefully smelled to make sure hydrogen sulfide was not developing on the sixth day after crushing the hydrometer read 4 brix the color of the new wine was light but a noticeable amount of astringency had developed it was time to press 
pressing 
a homemade hydraulic basket press was used to press the carignane pomace the fermentation mass was transferred from the plastic fruit bin directly into the press basket with a three gallon plastic bucket much of the liquid ran through the press as the basket was being filled and an eighteen gallon container caught the liquid coming out of the basket a small magnetically coupled transfer pump and half inch plastic tubing were used to transfer the wine from the press sump into a pair of 42 gallon polyethylene drums 
pressure was applied slowly to reduce the quantity of foam appearing between the slats at the bottom of the basket the pomace cake was broken up twice and three press cycles were needed before the pomace was acceptably dry 
this press has a 1/3 ton capacity so two partial press loads were needed all of the press wine was added to the main batch and the half ton of carignane grapes produced about eighty gallons of wine including the time needed to wash the press before and after and to clean up the mess the pressing operation lasted almost four hours 
completing fermentation 
since the wine was nearly dry foam problems were not anticipated and the plastic drums were sealed with fermentation locks a wine sample was taken every day and the brix was measured with a plus and minus five degree short range hydrometer after the wine had been in the plastic drums for eight days the hydrometer read 1 7 brix after ten days the reading was 1 6 brix and after 13 days it read 1 7 brix 
hydrometer readings had been less than 1 brix and the readings had remained steady for several days the hydrometer readings suggested fermentation was finished so the residual sugar in the wine was measured with a clinitest tablet the measurement showed less than 1/4 percent sugar remained in the wine so fermentation was complete 
cellar work 
twenty days after the yeast addition the wine was dry and it had started to clear the carignane wine was racked for the first time into a 12 year old 60 gallon oak barrel two glass carboys and a one gallon jug most of the gross lees had settled out and care was taken not to disturb the muck seventy one gallons of new wine remained after the first racking 
ml fermentation 
malolactic fermentation started spontaneously in the barrel just as it had in previous years but the wine in the glass containers showed no evidence of ml activity after two weeks 10 gallons of wine was withdrawn from the barrel wine in the glass carboys was pumped into the barrel and the carboys were refilled with the transferred wine after three more weeks a paper chromatogram showed no malic acid remained in the wine in any of the containers 
post fermentation so2 addition 
sulfur dioxide had been added when the grapes were crushed but very little of the initial so2 remains after primary fermentation is complete the absence of malic acid meant malolactic fermentation was complete so a standard post fermentation addition of 50 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine was made to all of the containers after another week the fermentation lock on the barrel was replaced with a silicone rubber bung the barrel was topped up once a week for the first six weeks 
2nd racking 
about four weeks after the first racking all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the barrel and both carboys were washed and then refilled with wine a sample was tested and the measurements showed the wine contained 24 milligrams per liter of free so2 the titratable acid was 0 61 
and the ph was 3 70 
oak chips 
ten ounces of loose oak chips were added to the 60 gallon barrel on january 22 and a small sample of wine was removed the sample was measured and it showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 21 milligrams per liter ta 0 60 and ph 3 70 a sample of wine was taken from the barrel on february 25 the sample was measured and the results were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 
3 73 the free so2 content of the wine was getting too low so 20 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was added 
3rd racking 
the carignane wine was racked for a third time in early march all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the barrel and the carboys were washed and then refilled with wine more than a gallon of cabernet sauvignon wine was needed to top up the second glass carboy 
wine aging 
aging was done in the 60 gallon oak barrel and two 5 gallon glass water bottles 
the wine was tasted and measured on march 29 the results obtained were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 24 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 71 a wine sample was tested on april 24 and this time the results showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? wine tasted harsh so2 19 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 75 
on may 30 the wine was tested with the following results color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 17 milligrams per liter ta 0 56 and ph 3 70 the oak was starting to show the wine seemed astringent 
the wine was tested again on june 27 the test results were color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 15 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 74 the wine seemed too astringent at this time the so2 was low so an addition of 20 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was made 
gelatin fining 
on july 29 the wine was measured again and it was critically tasted by several people the measurements showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 26 milligrams per liter ta 0 57 and ph 
3 76 everyone agreed that the oak flavors were good but four out of five people felt the wine was too astringent 
the wine was tasted several additional times on different days finally a decision was made the wine was too astringent to bottle and it needed to be fined to remove some of the excess tannin about fifty grams of dry gelatin powder were mixed with warm water and the solution was stirred until smooth the gelatin solution was added slowly while the wine was stirred continuously the wine was allowed to stand for ten days and then it racked off the gelatin lees 
getting ready to bottle 
two samples of wine were removed a couple of days before bottling time one wine sample was tasted and used for lab measurements everything seemed fine but the ph was almost 3 8 this is not an unusually high ph value for a red wine made from grapes raised in southern california however such a high ph value reduces the effectiveness of sulfur dioxide therefore enough sulfur dioxide was added to increase the free so2 content of the wine to 40 milligrams per liter the second wine sample was used to fill a clear 375 milliliter wine bottle the bottle was tightly sealed with a cork and the sample was placed in a refrigerator after two days the bottle was removed and allowed to come to room temperature after the bottle had been at room temperature for about 24 hours the sample was carefully examined the wine showed no haze and no tartrate crystals were found in the bottle the wine passed the stability test so it was declared ready for bottling 
bottling 
the 1993 carignane wine was bottled on 16 september 1994 all of the wine was racked into a large temporary container the wine was pumped from the temporary container through a one micron absolute pad filter and into a two spout gravity bottle filler the wine was bottled in clean previously washed used
 bottles before being filled each empty bottle was rinsed with clean hot water and then given a sterilizing rinse with a sulfur dioxide solution 
about two hours were required to rinse fill and cork the bottles the next day plastic heat shrink capsules and labels made on a home computer were applied to the bottles the bottles were placed in cardboard cases and extra labels were applied to one side and one end of each case the cases were sealed with clear tape so they could be stacked six cases high 
follow up 
at bottling time the carignane wine was clear and stable the wine had a medium ruby color and a clean nondescript nose it had the typical dusty and woody taste of young over oaked carignane wine the titratable acid was 0 58 the ph was 3 78 and the free sulfur dioxide was 40 milligrams per liter twenty eight cases were bottled at a cost of 7 39 per case 0 62 per bottle after several months the excessive oak taste had diminished and the wine developed a pleasant vanillin bottle bouquet 
chapter 19 
white wine 

 a case history 
many people feel chardonnay is the premier white wine grape it produces the great white burgundy wines including chablis poully fuissj and montrachet and chardonnay vines are widely grown around the world in 1995 about 72 000 acres of chardonnay were planted in california vineyards and it was the most widely planted california wine grape variety 
chardonnay is an early ripening grape variety and it is often the first variety picked each year it has small clusters of round thin skinned light yellow colored berries the thin skin and its early ripening characteristics make chardonnay fruit vulnerable to bird bee and wasp damage chardonnay prefers a cool growing climate and wines made from fruit grown in warm regions often lack acidity and varietal intensity 
chardonnay table wine is often produced in two different styles a light fruity style emphasizes the clean spicy apple characteristics of chardonnay grapes a heavier style wine integrates the rich complex buttery qualities obtained from malolactic fermentation and aging in oak much of the chardonnay wine produced falls somewhere between these two extreme styles

arrangements were made to obtain chardonnay fruit from a small home vineyard about thirty miles away the arrangements were simple the vineyard owner would supply the grapes the winemaker would supply the corks and bottles and the winemaker would be responsible for harvest decisions and the winemaking grower and winemaker would divide the finished wine evenly 
this vineyard was known to ripen early and the grapes were usually picked in the second or third weeks of august the first sugar sample was taken on july 26 the grapes were tested and the ta ph and brix values were recorded sugar samples were gathered and measured each friday morning until the grapes were picked 
picking & transport 
the grapes were picked very early the morning of 20 august 1995 when it was light enough to see the grapes three people started picking cluster stems were cut with small hand shears and the picked fruit was carried in 5 gallon plastic buckets when the buckets were full they were dumped directly into a half ton fruit bin in a pickup truck about 600 pounds of chardonnay grapes were picked in less than two hours the cold grapes were covered and transported to the crush area quickly before they became warm 
grape processing 

a small power crusher stemmer was placed on top of a ton plastic fruit bin the equipment was washed 
and carefully drained crushing started around 9 30 the grapes were moved from the truck into the 
crusher stemmer with a long handled fork sulfite solution was added as the grapes were being crushed 
the sulfite solution provided 35 milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of crushed grapes 
a small vertical basket press was used to press the chardonnay fruit the crushed grapes were transferred 
from the fruit bin into the press basket with a three gallon plastic bucket as the basket was being filled 
about half the juice ran through the press into a 5 gallon bucket when the bucket was full it was emptied 
into a 55 gallon polyethylene drum 

press pressure never exceeded 25 psi and the pressure was applied slowly to reduce foaming the press 
cake was broken up and repressed three times before the pomace was dry the small press had a 200pound capacity and three complete press loads were required 

including the time needed to wash the crusher and the press before and after the entire crushing and 
pressing operation lasted more than four hours the 600 pounds of chardonnay grapes and much work 
produced forty five gallons of juice 

testing fruit 
testing was done when juice became available sugar content was measured with a short ranged hydrometer a value of 23 3 brix was obtained after a temperature correction was applied the juice was cold the acid was tested and it was 0 58 percent the ph was 3 52 
cold settling juice 
the chardonnay juice was settled in a homemade cold box the cold box is made from 1 inch thick ridged foam insulation panels and it measures four feet wide four feet high and eight feet long the top of the box is hinged and can be raised for easy access a small 7000 btu window air conditioner mounted in one end of the insulated box keeps the temperature of the box below 56 degrees the 55 gallon drum of chardonnay juice was moved into the cold box when pressing was completed the temperature of the juice was 64 degrees when the it went into the box 
in the morning the juice temperature was down to 57 degrees then 39 gallons of clear juice was racked off the sediment into a clean 42 gallon polyethylene drum the remaining six gallons of juice and sediment were resettled in a refrigerator for two days and an additional two gallons of clear juice was reclaimed 
adjust fruit 
the acid content of the chardonnay juice was low just as it had been in previous years and enough tartaric acid was added to raise the ta of the juice to 0 69 percent juice ph was re measured and the tartaric acid addition reduced the ph to a value of 3 41 california chardonnay grapes are often low in available nitrogen so three ounces of diammonium phosphate were also added the dap crystals were dissolved in a little water and stirred into the juice 
fermentation 
forty grams of active dry prise de mousse yeast were stirred into 350 milliliters of warm water water temperature was adjusted to 99 degrees and the yeast mixture was stirred several times the mixture was 
allowed to rehydrate for about 25 minutes when the yeast mixture was smooth and creamy it was stirred into the juice and the drum was sealed with a fermentation lock 
no signs of fermentation were found the following morning and fermentation could not be detected on the second morning however by the evening of the second day the bell in the fermentation lock was up and the chardonnay juice was gassy fermentation was underway 
the temperature of the chardonnay juice was maintained at 56 to 58 degrees during the cold fermentation period each evening the temperature of the fermentation was measured and a hydrometer was used to check the sugar content of the juice five days after the yeast addition the sugar was down to 17 brix after ten days the sugar was about 9 brix and the sugar measured 2 brix after fifteen days 
the chardonnay wine was removed from the cold box on september 5 the container was topped up and the wine was allowed to warm to room temperature after three days at room temperature the wine was measured with a short range hydrometer and the hydrometer read 2 3 brix after two more days the hydrometer reading had not changed and the chardonnay wine seemed dry a complete fermentation record for the chardonnay wine is shown in table 13 
ml fermentation 
malolactic fermentation was started by adding dry viniflora oenos directly to the wine several days later the bell on the fermentation lock was up and ml fermentation appeared to be underway a paper chromatogram was made on october 6 and the chromatogram showed little malic acid remained in the wine 
so2 addition 
since malolactic fermentation seemed finished an addition of 50

table 13 the complete fermentation record for the 1995 chardonnay wine 

milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine mg/l was made to the new chardonnay wine the container was then topped up and sealed with a fermentation lock 
cellar work 
the wine remained on the gross lees for another two weeks after two weeks the wine was racked into a clean container and the container was topped up and sealed with a fermentation lock a sample of wine was tested and the measurements showed the wine contained 22 milligrams per liter of free so2 the titratable acid was 0 64 and the ph was 3 41 
oak chips 
on december 2 five ounces of loose oak chips were added to the chardonnay container a sample of wine was taken and measurements showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 19 milligrams per liter ta 0 65 and ph 3 40 
on january 6 a sample of chardonnay was taken from the container the wine was measured tasted and carefully examined the following results were obtained color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter ta 0 64 and ph 3 43 the free so2 was getting low so 25 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was added to the wine at this time 
hot & cold stabilization 
one liter of hot water was placed in a blender and 60 grams of agglomerated bentonite were slowly added to the water while the blender was running at high speed the bentonite mixture was allowed to cool for several hours the mixture was then sealed in a plastic bottle and placed in a refrigerator for a few days in mid january the 60 grams of hydrated bentonite were stirred into the chardonnay wine 
the next day the container of wine was moved into a small upright freezer the freezer is not equipped with an adjustable thermostat but the temperature can be controlled within a few degrees with an electric timer the freezer operated continuously until the temperature of the wine reached 29 degrees the timer was then used to keep the wine temperature between 27 and 30 degrees the wine was held at that cold temperature for six days finally the cold wine was racked into a clean container and allowed to warm to ambient temperature 
aging 
on february 9 the chardonnay was carefully tasted and measured the february testing gave the following information color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 24 milligrams per liter ta 
0 61 and ph 3 46 the winemaker felt that the wine would benefit from more oak character so two additional ounces of oak chips were added to the container 
on march 6 the wine was tested with the following results color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ? so2 20 milligrams per liter ta 0 60 and ph 3 44 little oak was showing 
the wine was tested again on april 10 the results of these tests showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 16 milligrams per liter ta 0 58 and ph 3 45 some oak was starting to show an addition of 15 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide was made at this time 
getting ready to bottle 
two samples of the wine were taken a couple of days before bottling lab measurements were made on one of the samples and the data showed color ok clarity ok aroma ok taste ok so2 19 milligrams per liter ta 0 61 and ph 3 44 the sulfur dioxide was too low so enough sulfur dioxide was added to increase the free sulfur dioxide content of the chardonnay wine to 28 milligrams per liter 
the second wine sample was used to fill a clear 375 milliliter wine bottle the bottle was sealed with a cork and placed in a refrigerator after two days the bottle was removed from the refrigerator and brought to ambient temperature after the sample had been at room temperature for 24 hours the wine was carefully examined the chardonnay wine showed no haze and no tartrate crystals could be found on the bottom of the bottle the wine was declared to be cold stable the next day the container of chardonnay wine was filtered with a 2 micron absolute pad filter to prepare the wine for bottling 
bottling 
the chardonnay wine was bottled on 1 may 1996 to reduce handling the wine was pumped directly from the polyethylene drum through a 0 5 micron filter and into a two spout gravity bottle filler each empty bottle was rinsed with clean hot water and a sulfite solution just before it was placed on the filler spout a little over an hour was required to rinse fill and cork the bottles plastic heat shrink capsules and labels were applied to the bottles the following day and the bottles were placed in cardboard cases labels were placed on each case to identify the contents and the cases were sealed with 2 inch clear plastic tape 
follow up 
at bottling time the wine was brilliantly clear and it had a pale straw color it had a clean nose and an oakey chardonnay taste the titratable acid measured 0 61 the ph was 3 44 and the free sulfur dioxide content was 28 milligrams per liter 
sixteen cases of chardonnay wine were bottled the oak taste diminished significantly after the wine had been in the bottle for a few months 
the grower seemed pleased with the wine when he received his eight cases

making sparkling wine 
sparkling wines are produced in france spain italy etc but only those sparkling wines made in a small region of france using the classical method are called champagne sparklers produced anywhere else are properly called sparkling wines sparkling wines are blended from several carefully selected lots of still wine and the french word for the batch of starting wine used to make champagne is cuvje classical sparkling wines are made by applying a multi step process to the blended still wine a second sugar fermentation takes place in the bottle and this fermentation produces a carefully controlled volume of carbon dioxide gas and a small amount of ethyl alcohol the carbon dioxide gas produces the desired effervescence the small quantity of additional alcohol is of little consequence 
four steps are used to produce traditional sparkling wine 1 first sugar and yeast are added to a finished still wine and the wine is bottled 2 fermentation converts the added sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas 3 the new sparkling wine is aged on the yeast lees for a year or more 4 after aging the sparkling wine is finished during finishing upside down bottles are turned repeatedly to work the yeast lees down onto the bottle caps after several weeks of turning when the yeast is on the caps the yeast lees are disgorged from the bottles any wine lost in disgorging is replaced with a small quantity of still wine containing sugar and the bottles are corked 
novice winemakers may find this process complex but the whole procedure becomes relatively simple when each step is understood nevertheless the production of traditional sparkling wine is by necessity a lengthy and labor intensive process the quality of sparkling wine is determined primarily by the starting cuvje and by the length of time the wine is aged on the yeast lees long aging times and extensive handling are required to produce a quality product the considerable time and effort required to produce quality sparkling wine accounts for its high cost 
cuvie 
finished sparkling wine quality depends largely on the characteristics of the starting cuvje and the starting wine should have several specific characteristics the starting wine must be dry or if it contains sugar the quantity of the sugar must be accurately known cuvje should have a clean neutral bouquet and any varietal flavors should be subtle cuvje has a high acid content ranging between 0 7 and 0 9 percent in addition the starting wine should be low in free sulfur dioxide less than 25 milligrams per liter and the alcohol content should be between 10 and 11 5 percent 
grapes harvested specifically for making sparkling wines are picked before they are completely ripe sugar content is often only 17 to 20 brix early picking helps insure subtle varietal flavors and a high acid level early harvested grapes also produce a starting cuvje with a low alcohol content and the low alcohol makes the second fermentation easier to start 
in the champagne region of france cuvje is made from about 2/3 pinot noir grapes and about 1/3 chardonnay grapes chardonnay is a white grape but pinot noir is a red grape most red grapes have colorless juice the color is in the grape skins since the red color is in the skins red grapes must be handled gently and pressed quickly to avoid introducing a blush color into the cuvje in california high quality blanc de blanc cuvje is often blended from wines made from chardonnay and pinot blanc grapes 
 in italy the famous asti spumante sparkling wine is made entirely from white muscat grapes 
blending cuvje 
sparkling wine cuvje must be clean stable and brilliantly clear home winemakers often produce a satisfactory cuvje by blending and modifying available dry white wines generally the alcohol content will be too high when white table wines are used and flavor levels are often to intense however the blend can be diluted with a small amount of water often a 10 percent water addition will reduce the alcohol content too less than 11 5 percent and dilute flavor intensities as well 
the titratable acid and the free sulfur dioxide content of the cuvje will also need adjusting most available table wines will require modest additions of acid to raise the ta to about 0 80 percent large additions of tartaric acid should be avoided or the wine may need to be cold stabilized again citric acid is often used for small acid adjustments because it does not produce instability problems 
the second fermentation in the bottle will be very difficult to start if the sulfur dioxide content of the starting wine is too high when the free sulfur dioxide content exceeds 25 milligrams per liter hydrogen peroxide can be used an addition of 3 5 milliliters of 3% hydrogen peroxide in 5 gallons of wine will remove 10 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide wine flavors or aromas are not affected significantly when hydrogen peroxide is used properly however hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent bench testing should be done when using hydrogen peroxide and accurate sulfur dioxide measurements are necessary 
measuring the sugar 
the total sugar content of the cuvje must be very carefully controlled if the sugar content is too low the finished wine will not have enough effervescence however if the sugar content is too high excessive pressures will be generated in the bottle and high pressures can cause the bottles to explode when commercial sparkling wines are made enough sugar is added to produce bottle pressures of about 90 pounds per square inch psi however home winemakers are strongly advised to work with less pressure 
 exploding bottles are the subject of jokes but they can be very serious hazards 
one and one half 1 5 ounces of sugar for each gallon of completely dry wine is recommended this quantity of sugar will produce a lively sparkle in the finished wine and bottle pressures will be held to about 40 psi ordinary white granulated household sugar should be used the starting wine must be completely dry and the residue sugar should be measured with a clinitest tablet the quantity of sugar must be accurately weighed and the volume of the cuvje accurately measured do not guess at any of these quantities the carefully measured sugar and a small amount of yeast nutrient should be added to the wine about 1/4 tsp of diammonium phosphate in 5 gallons of wine is the right amount stir the cuvje until all of the sugar and dap are dissolved 
secondary fermentation 
starting the second fermentation is very much like starting a stuck wine the process is quite simple but considerable attention by the winemaker is required first a pint of starter is made from dry yeast and a spoonful of sugar prise de mousse or california champagne yeast should be used these yeasts are tolerant to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide despite its name pasteur champagne yeast is not very good for sparkling wine production this yeast will ferment satisfactorily but pasteur champagne yeast lees are difficult to riddle 
when the starter is active an equal volume of cuvje is added to the starter and the quart of starter is set aside wait until the starter becomes active again then add a quart of cuvje when the starter is again active two quarts of cuvje is added this doubling process is continued until the entire batch of cuvje shows signs of active fermentation the doubling process can be accomplished in twenty four hours or so if the starter is kept warm low temperatures will require more time the cuvje is ready to bottle when a ring of fine bubbles appears around the edge of the container or when the winemaker observes other signs of fermentation 
the starting wine must be bottled in champagne type bottles do not use other kinds of bottles because the pressures are too high each bottle should be cleaned and inspected carefully and any bottles with scratches chips or cracks should be discarded clean sound bottles should be filled until the head space is about two inches all domestic champagne bottles are made with a special lip that allows the bottles to be closed with crown beer caps crown caps should be used to seal the bottles rather than corks caps are less expensive and they are much easier to remove later caps can be quickly and easily applied with a small hand capping machine 
aging 
much of the desired character of sparkling wine is derived from the wine being in contact with the yeast lees for an extended time yeast contact time is very important and a high quality product cannot be produced quickly in france all champagnes must spend at least one year on the yeast lees or the word champagne cannot be placed on the label all high quality sparklers spend from one to four years on the yeast lees some home winemakers produce a three or even four years supply of sparkling wine in a single batch making a large batch every three or four years is a good technique some wine is available to drink after a year but much of the sparkling wine can be aged for an extended time 
sparkling wine should be aged in a cool dark environment free from excessive vibration the bottles can be laid on their sides and stacked up like fire wood when the bottles are stacked this way the yeast lees are spread over a large surface area and the large surface area is an advantage however if adequate space is not available the wine can be stored in cardboard cartons with the bottles standing vertically with the points up in either case the bottles should be shaken gently every six months to agitate the yeast 
sediment back into suspension considerable care leather gloves and safety glasses are appropriate for the shaking procedure 
the finishing process 
sparkling wine is ready to finish after it has aged on the yeast lees for an appropriate time finishing a sparkling wine consists of three basic steps 1 first the yeast lees are induced to slide down the side of the bottle until all of the lees rest on the crown cap by riddling 2 the yeast lees are removed from the bottle by disgorging 3 finally the new sparkling wine is sweetened to the desired level and the bottle is corked 
riddling 
when aging is complete the next step is to remove the yeast lees from the bottle riddling is the name of the process used to move the yeast sediment down onto the crown caps traditionally large wooden racks were used to hold the bottles in a slanted position with their points down and each bottle was rotated about an eighth of a turn each day traditional wood riddling racks are heavy and considerable space is needed when these racks are used 
fortunately other techniques have been developed to coax the yeast down the side of the bottle onto the crown cap a simple method of riddling consists of placing the bottles in ordinary cardboard cartons with their points down then each day the bottles are jostled bumped or twisted early in the process the cartons are propped over at an angle later after the yeast has started to move down the side of the bottle the cartons are moved to a more vertical position the riddling process is strongly influenced by the type of yeast used and the cleanliness of the bottles usually six or eight weeks are needed to complete the riddling operation however under adverse conditions three or four months may be required if the bottles were not scrupulously clean sparkling wine can be almost impossible to riddle 
disgorging 
since small producers often work with a minimum of equipment removing the yeast sediment from the bottle is often the most difficult step in the sparkling winemaking process the objective of the disgorging operation is to remove all of the yeast from the bottle without reducing the carbon dioxide pressure significantly 
the classical method of removing the yeast is a multi step process 1 the bottles are chilled with their points down until the temperature of the wine is less than 45 degrees 2 the necks of the bottles are placed in a cold brine solution until a plug of ice an inch or so long freezes in the necks of the bottles 3 the bottles are removed from the brine solution and the necks of the bottles are dipped in clean room temperature water 4 after the brine has been washed away the necks of the bottles are raised to a 45degree angle and the crown caps are removed quickly 5 the plugs of ice flies from the bottles and the ice carries most of the yeast sediment away 6 the winemakers left thumb is judiciously applied to each bottle to control gushing if the wine is cold and if the bottles were clean gushing quickly subsides 7 the winemaker then uses the little finger on his right hand to wipe away any remaining yeast from the inside surfaces of the mouths of the bottles 
a written description of this process sounds complicated but after a few bottles have been disgorged the whole procedure becomes quite simple and the work progress rapidly 
sweetening and corking 
most people prefer off dry sparklers and wines containing 1 to 4 percent residual sugar are common the desired level of sugar is introduced by adding a small dose of syrup to each bottle after the yeast has been removed this syrup also contains a small amount of sulfur dioxide to help preserve the sparkling wine the syrup is made up ahead of time and the syrup must be well chilled before it is added to the disgorged bottles 
a typical syrup contains 375 grams of sugar one gram of sulfite powder and 700 ml liters of dry white wine when 30 ml of this syrup is added to a standard 750 ml bottle the finished sparkling wine will contain about 2 percent sugar and about 30 milligrams per liter sulfur dioxide of course the sugar and so2 can be adjusted to any desired level 
syrup should be added to the bottles after any remaining yeast has been wiped away each bottle is tipped to a 60 degree angle so the syrup runs down the inside surface of the bottle the syrup must be cold and it must be added slowly and continuously to avoid gushing after the syrup has been added the liquid level in the bottle should be adjusted by adding wine from a reserved bottle of cold sparkling wine when the head space is correct the bottle can be sealed with a polyethylene stopper and a wire hood should be attached to hold the stopper in place after all the bottles are sealed the outside surfaces should be rinsed clean with cold water then the bottles can be set aside to dry and labels can be applied after the bottles reach room temperature new sparkling wines should be allowed to rest for a few weeks in a cool quiet place to recover from bottle shock after a short rest the sparkling wine will be ready to use sparkling wines usually keep well but after the yeast has been removed the wine will show little improvement with further aging 
summary 
sparkling wine is made by adding sugar and yeast to a still wine and the wine is tightly sealed in bottles specially designed to withstand high pressures a second fermentation takes place in the bottle and the carbon dioxide gas produced gives the wine the desired effervescence 
quality sparkling wine is aged on the yeast lees for a year or more then the wine is ready to finish the yeast is worked down the side of the bottle until all the sediment rests on the cap and then the yeast is expelled from the bottle the wine is then sweetened with syrup and the bottle is sealed with a polyethylene stopper 
the starting wine must be dry and the added sugar must be measured carefully only sound champagne type bottles can be used for making sparkling wine

making fruit wines 
the grape harvest period in southern california extends from about mid august until early october so wine can be made from grapes only a few weeks each year on the other hand excellent wines can be made from fresh fruit six or seven months of the year when frozen fruit is used wine can be made the year around 
making fruit wine is different from making wine from grapes grapes have just about the right amount of sugar and acid to make a balanced wine but most other kinds of fruit require large additions of sugar and significant acid adjustments fruit winemaking is more complicated because the acidity of different types of fruit varies over wide ranges consequently when fruit wine is made the winemaker must carefully measure and adjust both the sugar content and the acid content of the fruit these basic adjustments are made before fermentation is started 
although dry wines can be produced easily most people prefer off dry or semi sweet fruit wines a small amount of residual sugar seems to preserve and enhance the characteristics of the fruit used to make the wine consequently most fruit wines are finished with a sugar content ranging from one to four ounces of sugar per gallon of wine 0 75 to 3 percent sugar some types of fruit seem particularly suitable for making dessert style wines these wines often contain four to twelve ounces of sugar per gallon of wine 3 to 9 percent sugar and they are often fortified with additional alcohol dry red table wines can be made from elderberries blackberries blueberries loganberries and boysenberries sometimes dry well aged berry wines are difficult to distinguish from high quality grape wine 
fruit winemaking steps 
making fruit wine consists of several different steps and some steps require considerable time drinkable wine can be made in two or three months but most high quality white or blush fruit wines are bottled when they are about six months old heavy dark colored fruit wines are often nine to twelve months old when bottled 
fruit winemaking can be divided into five basic steps each of the following steps contributes to the overall quality of the wine however the quality of the finished wine depends primarily on using high quality ripe fruit 
 1 
 fruit is inspected and prepared for fermentation 

 2 
 appropriate amounts of water sugar acid and sulfur dioxide are added to the fruit and 

sometimes other materials are added to produce a fermentable must 

 3 
fermentation is started by adding a suitable wine yeast to the prepared must 

 4 
 when fermentation is complete the new wine is clarified and stabilized by racking fining and filtering 

 5 
when the wine is clear and stable it is bottled 

fruit 
wine can be made from practically any type of fruit but not all types of fruit are suitable for making all styles of wine selecting a wine style to match the type of fruit available is an important part of fruit winemaking and winemaking experience is needed when wine is made from exotic fruits like pineapples guavas or mangos 
amount of fruit 
the quantity of fruit needed to make a given wine style depends on the flavor intensity of the particular fruit and on the flavor level wanted in the finished wine usually from 3 to 6 pounds of fruit are needed for each gallon of wine raspberries and a few other types of fruit have very strong flavors and wine made from six pounds of raspberries per gallon have intense raspberry flavors other fruits such as bananas have very bland tastes and producing wines with strong banana tastes would be difficult 
three to six pounds of fruit per gallon of wine generally produce an acceptable product however experience with a particular type of fruit is always helpful when a winemaker is trying to decide how much fruit to use unless exceptionally strong fruit characteristics are wanted three or four pounds of fruit is a good starting point 
fruit preparation 
only sound ripe fruit should be used for winemaking most types of fruit should be washed to remove insecticides fungicides or bugs superficial blemishes on the fruit will do no harm but rotten fruit should be discarded moldy fruit will give the finished wine a moldy taste and rotten or badly bruised fruit can carry harmful bacteria into the wine off flavors can be avoided by sorting over the fruit carefully and using a sharp knife to remove gross blemishes rot or mold 
stems and leaves should be removed from the fruit generally seeds should be removed if they have a distinctly bitter taste and most fruit winemakers prefer to remove the stones from plums prunes peaches apricots and cherries however some winemakers deliberately retain some seeds from these fruits to provide extra tannin most stone fruit wines are made in an off dry or sweet style 
on the other hand skins contain desirable flavor materials so skins are usually retained usually plums prunes apricots peaches and most berries are fermented with the juice pulp and skins together for a few days to extract flavors here the fruit should be chopped and then crushed running fruit through a very course grinder is a practical way of preparing large quantities of fruit for this type of fermentation 
although most fruit wines are made with some residual sugar some very pleasant dry red table wines have been made by fermenting a mixture of several different kinds of dark colored berries this style of red fruit wine is often fermented aged and finished just like a red grape table wine juice skins pulp and seeds of blackberries boysenberries cranberries elderberries blueberries gooseberries loganberries mulberries raspberries and strawberries are usually included in the fermentation berries used for winemaking should be very ripe and sorted carefully berries can be prepared for fermentation easily by mashing seeds contain a variety of tannin materials too much tannin can give wine a bitter taste and make wine excessively astringent so seeds should not be ground mashed or cracked 
wine made from oranges oxidizes very easily and good orange table wines are difficult to make however pleasant sherry style wines can be easily made from oranges citrus fruit skins contain considerable oily material and most winemakers prefer to eliminate skins from citrus fruit fermentations the membrane under grapefruit skins contains much bitter material and this white pulpy material should be removed carefully 
many fruit winemakers simplify the handling of skins and pulp by placing these materials in a nylon mesh jelly bag when fermentation is started the jelly bag full of pulp is suspended in the liquid the wine gets all the benefits from the solid materials but separating the liquid from the pulp at the end of fermentation is much easier 
making the must 
grapes contain all the necessary ingredients to make a balanced wine but other kinds of fruit require additions of several different materials before successful fermentation can take place besides the fruit good quality water will be needed and at a minimum the sugar and acid content of the must will need adjusting 
the sugar content of the must can be measured easily with a brix hydrometer a reading of about 22 brix will be right for most fruit wine fermentations add a small quantity of sugar to the must stir until all the sugar is dissolved then take a reading with the hydrometer continue this procedure until the hydrometer reads 22 brix ordinary white granulated table sugar sucrose should be used to increase the sugar content of the prepared fruit 
an acid test kit should be used to measure the acid content of the must a value of 0 65 to 0 70 percent grams per 100 ml is about right for the starting acid content for off dry fruit wines a value of 0 60 to 
0 65 percent may be more appropriate when the wine will be finished dry acid blend is available at winemaking shops and most winemakers use this material to increase the acidity of fruit musts acid blend is a mixture of citric malic and tartaric acids and this mixture seems particular suitable for fruit wines the acid crystals must be completely dissolved 
very small amounts of sulfur dioxide should be added to musts made from fruit one campden tablet for each gallon of must is the right amount the sulfur dioxide reduces juice oxidation sulfur dioxide kills bacteria and it also helps control wild yeasts always present on fruit making a satisfactory fruit wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult 
depending on the specific circumstances tannin may be added to fruit wine musts tannin is a material in the skins and seeds of fruit and it adds desirable astringency to the wine tannin also acts as a wine purifier and a natural preservative 
yeast requires nitrogen to multiply properly during the early stages of fermentation and many fruits are low in available nitrogen consequently small quantities of a material called yeast energizer are often added to fruit musts to supply extra nitrogen and help the yeasts multiply quickly many fruits particularly apples and plums have a high pectin content pectin causes fruit juice to solidify into jam or jelly and pectin can cause problems in wine the pectin carries over through fermentation and makes the wine difficult to clarify most fruit winemakers add pectic enzymes see below to their fruit musts before fermentation is started enzymes break down the pectin in the fruit and then the wine can be clarified easily enzymes also help extract color from the fruit 
many fruit winemakers add mashed fresh bananas to their fruit wine musts the bananas do not change wine flavors significantly but after fermentation the bananas help the new wine clarify bananas also increase the body of the wine and from to 2 pounds per gallon often improve the mouth feel of the finished wine 
fermentation 
wine yeast is available either as a liquid culture or in dry granular form either type works well but dry yeast is easier to prepare and use many different strains of wine yeast are available some types of yeast can produce high alcohol levels other types of yeast cannot ferment at low temperatures some types of yeast produce excessive amounts of foam and the foam causes the containers to overflow epernay ii is a slow fermenting yeast and it is often used for light off dry fruity style wines pasteur champagne yeast is more vigorous and it is often used for dry wines when neutral flavors are wanted prise de mousse dry yeast is a general purpose yeast this yeast is vigorous but it produces little foam the yeast used for fermentation has little influence on the flavors of aged wine 
a good general rule is to use one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must some winemakers prefer using half this amount other winemakers prefer to use twice this amount many fruit winemakers just sprinkle the dry yeast on the must but all yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry yeast in a small amount of warm water about a cup of water for each tablespoon of dry yeast should be used the temperature of the water should be 95 degrees so a thermometer should be used the yeast mixture should be stirred several times and then the yeast mixture should stand for 20 minutes before it is poured into the must 
active fermentation should start 12 to 48 hours after the yeast is added the time will depend upon the temperature of the must how much sulfur dioxide is used and several other factors when fruit pulp is fermented in an open fermenter the container should be covered with a sheet of plastic stir the must at least once each day after two or three days of active fermentation the liquid is separated from the pulp with a nylon jelly bag by racking or by straining the solid materials are discarded and the liquid should be placed in a closed container to finish fermentation carbon dioxide gas from the fermentation must be vented from the closed contained fill a fermentation lock half full of plain water and attach the lock to the container 
generally hot fast fermentations are undesirable rapid fermentations produce large quantities of carbon dioxide and much of the desirable fruit odors and flavors are carried away by the gas in addition fast fermentations do not provide enough time to extract adequate fruit odors and flavors from the solid materials long slow fermentations produce more flavorful wines and fermentation temperatures can affect wine flavors considerably temperatures between 70 and 75 degrees are desirable at the start of fermentation however once fermentation is underway the temperature should be reduced and kept between 60 and 70 degrees the lower temperature provides the slow fermentation needed for good wine quality 
dry white wines 
making good quality dry white table wine from fruit is a difficult undertaking but fruit winemakers become very skilled in producing this style of wine the most suitable types of fruit for making dry table wines are pears apples or gooseberries these types of fruit are also suited for making sparkling wines 
dry white table wines are best made by fermenting only clarified juice first the fruit is washed and then converted to purje by crushing some winemakers prefer to use a food processor for preparing fruit for dry white wine but the seeds should not be ground up water sugar acid sulfur dioxide and all of the other ingredients except the yeast are added to the finely chopped fruit the must is then covered with a sheet of plastic and cooled to a low temperature the must is kept cold for 24 to 72 hours to extract as much flavor from the pulp and skins as possible after a suitable time the liquid is separated from the solid material much of the solid material settles to the bottom of the container while the must is standing and the clear liquid came be removed by siphoning straining or pressing the solids are discarded and only clear juice is fermented when making dry table wines 
all fruit contains natural yeast and this technique of cold soaking is only possible if the must is kept cold otherwise native yeasts will start spontaneous fermentation even at low temperatures some danger of spontaneous fermentation exists and the winemaker should watch the cold must carefully if any signs of spontaneous fermentation appear ring of bubbles around the edge of the container the juice should be racked off the solid material and a suitable wine yeast should be added 
an open fermenter is not needed when clarified juice is fermented so a closed fermenter should be used to reduce oxidation fill the closed fermenter about three fourths full and seal the container with a fermentation trap filled with plain water when fermentation is complete rack the wine off the yeast lees and add one campden tablet for each gallon of wine 
clarification and stabilization 
new wines contain yeast cells bacteria small bits of skin pulp etc these particles are pulled down by gravity and they slowly settle to the bottom of the container the smaller the particle the slower it sinks to the bottom of the container some particles are so small they never sink to the bottom and these particles remain suspended in the liquid 
 racking is a process used to separate the clean wine from the lees the muck on the bottom of the container after wine has been racked two or three times the muck will be gone and the wine will become clear and bright when small containers are used racking is usually done by siphoning the wine off the lees with a piece of transparent plastic hose exposing wine to air can cause oxidation so wine should not be splashed frothed or bubbled when racking 
new wines should be racked into a clean container two or three weeks after the completion of fermentation most of the yeast lees will be left behind if the racking is done carefully one campden tablet for each gallon of wine should be added and the container sealed with a fermentation lock when fruit wines are six to eight weeks old they should be racked from the secondary lees and a few weeks after the second racking some fruit wines will be clear and bright if a new fruit wine is not clear at this time it should be fined to remove the suspended particles the fining material causes the very small particles to lump together the particles grow in size and the larger particles settle out of the wine more quickly sparkolloid and bentonite are two effective fining materials for clarifying fruit wines follow the directions on the packages carefully when using these materials 
sparkolloid is the least harmful fining material too much bentonite can strip desirable aromas and flavors from fruit wine so most winemakers prefer to clarify with sparkolloid three weeks after a sparkolloid addition the wine should be racked again to separate it from the sparkolloid lees splashing and bubbles in the wine should be avoided when racking if sparkolloid does not provide adequate wine clarity a bentonite treatment may be necessary 
most off dry fruit wines will be ready to prepare for bottling a month or two after clarification fining some home winemakers hold back a small quantity of the original juice by freezing a few weeks before bottling time the juice is thawed clarified by racking and added to the wine the added juice provides more fruity flavors and it adds a small amount of residual sugar to the wine however the wine contains sugar after the juice addition and special precautions are required to prevent renewed fermentation see below how much juice is added can be best determined by tasting but many winemakers add 5 to 20 percent juice when this method is used bottling 
fruit wines must be brilliantly clear and completely stable before bottling wine bottled without sufficient so2 will be short lived so the free sulfur dioxide content should be raised to 30 or 40 milligrams per liter a few days before bottling time one crushed campden tablet for each gallon of wine is the correct amount if sugar is added to sweeten the wine potassium sorbate should also be added the added sugar will start to ferment without the sorbate and fermentation after bottling will generally produce a cloudy sediment and spoil the wine directions supplied with the sorbate should always be followed and sorbate additions should always be measured carefully 
clean used wine bottles should be rinsed with very hot water before the bottles are filled with wine although bottles can be filled with a plastic hose a bottle filler of some kind should always be used to reduce wine oxidation bottles should be filled from the bottom and filling should be done slowly to reduce the quantity of foam produced bottles should be filled until no more than a quarter inch of space exists between the wine and the bottom of the cork most plastic wand type bottle fillers do not fill the bottles high enough and a bit more wine must be added after the filler is removed 
dry corks should be driven into the bottles if possible however many small corking machines will not adequately compress dry corks so soaking corks in cold water for a few minutes may be necessary a pinch of sulfite added to the water may help sterilize the corks after all the corks have been driven the top of each cork should be wiped to remove the excess cork water the full bottles should stand upright for several days to let the pressure equalize in the bottles when the pressure has equalized the bottles can be laid on their sides and stored in a cool place 
after wine has been bottled for a year or two the winemaker may have trouble remembering what type of wine is in the bottles so all bottled wine should have an appropriate label permanently attached 
fruit winemaking materials 
depending on the circumstances winemakers use many different materials for the production of fruit wines 
 most fruit wine fermentations are made using readily available materials but an exotic material may be needed occasionally to solve a specific problem some common fruit winemaking materials are briefly discussed here 
acid 
the three most important organic acids found in fruit are tartaric malic and citric acid balance is very important for producing high quality wine and the acid content of the fruit must be adjusted carefully if the wine contains too little acid it will taste flat and bland when too much acid is present the wine will be too tart or even sour tasting wines containing considerable sugar need more acid to be balanced tartaric acid malic acid citric acid or acid blend a mixture of all three acids are used to increase the acid level in fruit wines large quantities of citric acid should be used with some caution because a strong citric taste may not be appropriate in some types of fruit wine 
fining materials 
fining agents are often used in the production of fruit wines gelatins are sometimes used to remove excess astringency from fruit wines the clay like material bentonite is used to remove excess protein and improve the stability of these wines sparkolloid and bentonite are the two materials of choice for clarifying most types of fruit wine wines are usually fined with sparkolloid first then if the wine does not come clear bentonite is used other fining materials like isinglass or casein are also used to clarify both red and white fruit wines most fining materials require from a few days to two weeks to settle to the bottom of the container then the clear wine is racked off the sediment and very little of the fining material remains in the finished wine instructions supplied with fining materials should be followed carefully 
pectic enzymes 
pectin makes jam and jelly set all fresh fruits contain some pectin and some types of fruit like apples apricots and plums contain large amounts pectin often causes problems for the fruit winemaker pectin can hold small particles in suspension and wines containing excessive pectin often do not clear and remain cloudy pectinase is an enzyme that breaks the large pectin molecules into smaller less troublesome molecules so pectinase is a great help in clarifying cloudy wines containing excessive amounts of pectin 
potassium sorbate 
wines containing residual sugar and less than 16 percent alcohol can start fermenting anytime consequently all off dry and sweet wines must be stabilized by a special treatment potassium sorbate added to clean clear wine can prevent fermentation from restarting however sorbate will not stop active fermentations and sorbate cannot stop wines containing many yeast cells from fermenting sorbate only works when the wine has been carefully racked or filtered to remove most of the viable yeast cells potassium sorbate is not a very stable material and poorly stored sorbate can deteriorate in a few months 
sulfur dioxide 
sulfur dioxide is used in wine to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and to help reduce the effects of oxidation however sulfur dioxide is a pungent gas this material must be carefully measured and it must be used in very small quantities potassium metabisulfite sulfite crystals are added to juice or wine to provide the sulfur dioxide gas campden tablets are made by compressing sulfite crystals into a pill form so campden tablets can also be used to provide sulfur dioxide some winemakers believe campden tables contain a filler and the filler causes haze problems in some kinds of wine campden tables are easier to use when just a few gallons of wine are being produced however when larger quantities of wine are made most winemakers prefer to use sulfite crystals the crystals should be mixed with an ounce or two of water before being added to the wine sugar 
the alcohol content of the finished wine depends upon the quantity of sugar in the juice sometimes home winemaking shops recommend special kinds of sugar but ordinary white household sugar sucrose is quite satisfactory for making fruit wine the yeast produces the enzymes needed to convert the sucrose into glucose and fructose 
tannin 
tannin materials give wine its characteristic astringency tannin helps a young wine spontaneously clear and it contributes to the longevity of the wine tannin originates in the seeds stems and skins of fruit some types of fruit like bananas contain very little natural tannin and producing a balanced wine from fruit low in tannin can be difficult consequently winemakers often add extra tannin to fruit musts that lack sufficient natural astringency yeast energizer 
yeast cells need available nitrogen to reproduce and create the large population of cells needed for successful fermentation yeast energizers contain food grade diammonium phosphate dap and the dap provides extra nitrogen to keep the yeast happy healthy and reproducing new yeast cells high alcohol levels seem to prevent yeast from assimilating nitrogen so nitrogen should be added early in the fermentation cycle before a large amount of alcohol has accumulated 
wine yeast 
a variety of wine yeasts can be obtained in dry form epernay is a very popular yeast for all types of fruit wines pasteur champagne yeast is vigorous and tolerant of sulfur dioxide prise de mouse is an excellent general purpose wine yeast winemakers use many different types of yeasts but the different yeasts are used for reasons other than creating wine flavors 
fruit winemaking equipment 
with one or two exceptions little special equipment is needed to make fruit wine and many home winemakers ferment small quantities of wine each year using implements from the kitchen however specialized winemaking equipment can reduce time and labor and purchasing specialized pieces of winemaking equipment may be desirable when large quantities of wine are made beginning winemakers should beware of the gadgets sold in some home winemaking shops many of these accessories are poorly designed and cheaply made like most other things cheap winemaking equipment is generally a poor value several basic pieces of fruit winemaking equipment are briefly discussed below 
acid test kit 
the acid content of different kinds of fruit varies widely and acid content varies from year to year the only practical way of controlling acid balance in the finished wine is to measure and adjust the acid content of the must before fermentation is started wine quality improves greatly when the winemaker obtains the necessary equipment and takes the time to learn how to measure acidity acid test kits for measuring the acid content of must juice or wine can be purchased at most home winemaking shops 
bottle filler 
to reduce wine oxidation bottles must be filled from the bottom with a minimum of splashing and bubbling 
 filling bottles without splashing is difficult with a siphon hose so an inexpensive wand type bottle filler should be used wand type fillers consist of a length of rigid tubing with a small valve at the bottom end when the filler is inserted in an empty bottle the valve presses against the bottom and the wine starts to flow the flow stops automatically when the operator raises the tube fillers allow bottles to be filled with a minimum of splashing and wine oxidation is minimized 
corker 
driving a cork into a wine bottle by hand is very difficult so a corking machine of some kind is needed when using cork finished bottles inexpensive corking machines are slow and most are difficult to use most of the inexpensive machines are not suitable for corking more than a few gallons of wine a good corking machine is indispensable when several cases of wine are produced unfortunately good floor corkers cost about 100 corkers are not used very often and beginners can often borrow a corker from a fellow winemaker 
fermentation locks 
fermentation locks are used on closed fermenters to let the carbon dioxide gas escape while keeping air from coming in rubber stoppers are used to attach the locks to the containers 
fruit wine containers 
wine must always be protected from air or the wine will oxidize and become undrinkable winemakers use two kinds of containers during active fermentation large amounts of carbon dioxide gas are produced and the gas effectively excludes the air from the wine consequently open fermenters can be used for the first few days of fermentation when lots of carbon dioxide gas is produced when fermentation starts to subside much less carbon dioxide gas is produced then the wine must be transferred into a closed container and a fermentation lock must be attached the lock lets the carbon dioxide gas escape but it keeps air out of the container 
open fermenters are used for mixing ingredients or they are used for fermentations that contain solid materials like skins or pulp a large food grade polyethylene container equipped with a removable lid makes an ideal open fermenter however many fruit winemakers have used new plastic trash cans as open fermenters 
closed fermenters have small openings and they can be sealed easily with a cork cap bung or fermentation lock closed containers are always used when the fermentation does not contain solid materials and closed containers are always needed at the end of all fermentations when the co2 gas starts to subside five gallon water bottles carboys make good closed fermenters and they are very popular for making fruit wine water bottles are easy to obtain and glass is easy to clean and sterilize however glass water bottles have several disadvantages glass water bottles are heavy and they are expensive glass is fragile so glass carboys must be handled very carefully to avoid breakage 
some winemakers prefer to use polyethylene drums for making fruit wines and these containers are available in sizes ranging from 10 to 60 gallons polyethylene containers have several advantages polyethylene drums are practically unbreakable and they are inexpensive plastic drums are light weight and easy to store some commercial wineries are now using polyethylene storage tanks these new tanks are made of high density polyethylene and they are much less expensive than stainless steel tanks 
stainless steel is still the material of choice for large commercial fermentation and storage tanks stainless tanks are easy to clean and stainless steel conducts heat well small size stainless steel containers are very expensive and often cost several dollars per gallon of capacity however used stainless steel beer kegs are readily available and they make excellent storage containers for all kinds of wine 
oak barrels are often used for aging high quality commercial red wines the oak wood imparts desirable flavors to the wine however oak flavors are not suitable for many types of fruit wines in addition new barrels are expensive and oak barrels are difficult to maintain properly 
hydrometer 
hydrometers are used to measure the sugar content of must before and during fermentation and a hydrometer is one of the few indispensable pieces of winemaking equipment most fruit does not contain enough sugar to make stable wine so additional sugar is usually needed different kinds of fruit contain widely varying amounts of sugar and a hydrometer is always needed to measure fruit wine musts some fruit winemakers prefer hydrometers calibrated in specific gravity because many fruit wine recipes list sugar content in these units commercial winemakers use hydrometers calibrated with the brix scale a cylinder is needed to use a hydrometer effectively 
racking hose 
racking is done to move wine from one container to another and when racking is done properly practically all of the sediment is left behind siphoning is the easiest way of transferring wine from one container to another and a 6 foot length of inch plastic tubing should be kept specifically for that purpose the tubing should always be washed just before it is used and then washed again when racking is finished finally hang the tubing up on a rack or several nails driven into a wall so the water can drain completely 
miscellaneous equipment 
a thermometer is often needed to monitor fermentation temperatures and to measure water temperature when rehydrating dry yeast an 8 inch plastic funnel is useful from time to time a large wooden spoon is handy for stirring small fermentations bottle brushes are necessary when old wine bottles are recycled a set of plastic measuring spoons is helpful for measuring small quantities of winemaking materials a large plastic beaker calibrated in both milliliters and liquid ounces is handy for measuring liquids 
summary 
little specialized equipment is required to make fruit wines and most of the items can be found in the kitchen excellent wines can be made from fruit and fresh fruit is available for several months each year most fruit wines are finished in an off dry or sweet style but very pleasant dry red table wines can be made from a mixture of dark colored berries 
many fruit wines are made by fermenting the pulp skins and juice together dry white table wines are made differently first the must is prepared then chilled and allowed to stand after about 48 hours the clear liquid is separated from the pulp and only the clarified juice is fermented 
most fruit wines do not require extensive aging however dry red wines made from dark colored berries are often finished and aged just like red grape wines

hints kinks and gadgets 
winemaking consists of many small operations and some winemaking procedures are only done once each season consequently several years of experience may be needed to develop basic winemaking skills novice home winemakers can get many useful ideas and gain experience by visiting experienced home winemakers or small commercial wineries much practical information can be learned simply by observing how specific winemaking operations are done and tricks of the trade can be learned quickly a variety of information on methods techniques and gadgets suitable for producing small quantities of wine is presented here 
getting ready 
some home winemakers are disappointed each crush season when they are unable to purchase wine grapes these winemakers discover they have waited too long and grapes are no longer available beginning winemakers often experience this problem and they become frustrated other winemakers simply procrastinate and they are never ready to make wine when the grapes become ripe these winemakers suddenly discover the grapes are ripe and they scramble to get their winemaking equipment checked cleaned and ready to process the grapes 
buying grapes 
vineyard managers like to sell their crops early in the year commercial wineries usually complete their arrangements for purchasing grapes by june or early july home winemakers should contact commercial growers as early as possible and complete arrangements no later than the 4th of july 
getting equipment ready 
most home winemakers should consider the first week in august as get ready time and all of the winemaking equipment should be taken out of storage checked repaired and cleaned thoroughly the equipment will then be ready to handle the crush expeditiously when the grapes are ripe an inventory of winemaking supplies should be taken and orders should be placed for needed materials yeast and sulfite should be replaced each year 
wine yield 
commercial wineries use automatic or semiautomatic horizontal presses and a minimum amount of labor is required to produce dry pomace with these machines depending on the variety of grapes horizontal presses produce 150 to 180 gallons of wine per ton of grapes on the other hand most home winemakers use small vertical basket presses these little presses can produce high quality juice however considerable work is required and most home winemakers are not prepared to expend the labor needed to dry the pomace completely consequently home winemakers often get 140 to 150 gallons of wine from a ton of grapes a case of wine contains 2 4 gallons so most home winemakers get from 58 to 62 cases of wine from a ton of fruit 
grape quantities needed 
sometimes beginning winemakers have trouble estimating how many 
pounds gallons gallons
grapes are needed the data shown in table 14 provides a 

of of red of 
reasonable basis for making fruit estimates home winemakers often 

white
get about 150 gallons per ton for red wines however white grapes 

grapes wine wine 
are more difficult to press than red pomace and white grapes are particularly difficult to handle with a vertical basket press 
100 7 6
consequently most home winemakers only get 120 to 130 gallons of 
200 15 13
white juice per ton of grapes the values shown in table 14 were 
300 22 19
calculated based on a yield of 150 gallons for red wine and 125

containers 
900 67 56 1000 75 63
a variety of containers are needed for winemaking boxes or other 
2000 150 125 
shallow containers are used to transport grapes from the vineyard to 
table 14 typical wine yields when a
the winemaking area open containers are used for mixing and for 
small basket press is used 
red fermentations closed containers are used for fermenting white juice and for storing and aging wine 
stainless steel is the material of choice for wine storage containers because it is inert cleans easy and lasts for many years unfortunately small stainless steel tanks suitable for wine storage are very expensive so containers made of glass polyethylene and wood are often used surplus beer kegs are an exception and many home winemakers use stainless steel beer kegs for wine storage 
bulk grape containers 
standard 2 ton gondolas measure 96 inches long by 48 inches wide by 48 inches high a 1 ton tank measures about 48 x 48 x 48 inches a fruit bin measuring 48 inches by 48 inches by 22 inches will hold about 1000 pounds of grapes 
a 48 inch x 32 inch x 24 inch box will hold about 650 pounds of grapes and standard 32 gallon plastic trash cans hold about 135 pounds when lined with trash bags plastic milk crates hold 35 or 40 pounds of grapes round 5 gallon plastic buckets hold 22 to 24 pounds 
bulk containers are usually not needed when home winemakers purchase grapes by the ton large quantities of grapes can be hauled easily by lining the bed of a pickup truck with a sheet of 4 mil polyethylene the fruit is dumped directly into the bed of the truck 
open fermenters 
many home winemakers use 32 gallon plastic trash cans for fermenting red wine plastic trash cans are inexpensive and light weight open red fermenters should only be filled to 80 percent of capacity to prevent over flowing so 32 gallon trash cans can ferment about 230 pounds of crushed grapes almost 400 pounds of crushed grapes can be fermented in a 55 gallon polyethylene drum with the head removed and a plastic half ton bin will ferment about 1400 pounds of crushed grapes 
beer kegs 
surplus stainless steel beer kegs make excellent wine storage containers modern beer kegs hold 15 5 gallons and they are readily available beer kegs cost about a dollar a gallon stainless steel beer kegs are easy to clean and they last forever a #11 stopper or a silicone bung can be used to seal beer kegs 
oak barrels 
wine barrels are made in two standard sizes 200 liters and 225 liters two hundred liter barrels hold approximately 52 gallons and 225 liter barrels hold about 59 gallons most american made barrels hold 52 gallons and most french barrels hold 59 gallons half barrels hold 25 to 30 gallons 
bungs 
some winemakers place small pieces of cloth or burlap under wooden bungs although popular such an arrangement allows considerable air to enter the barrel and this technique should not be used for quality table wine production although more expensive silicone rubber bungs are much better than old fashion wood bungs rubber bungs seal the barrels tightly and they are easy to remove best of all they do not deform the bung holes in expensive barrels 
container case capacity 
five gallon glass carboys contain two cases of wine full 15 5 gallon beer kegs hold six cases a 27gallon polyethylene drum holds about 11 cases a 52 gallon barrel holds 22 cases of wine and a 59 gallon barrel holds 24 cases a 165 gallon polyethylene tank holds about 68 cases and a 1000 gallon tank contains 415 cases 
sanitation 
maintaining sanitary conditions in the home winery entails more than just hosing down the garage floor sanitation activities include washing old bottles cleaning the equipment disposing of pomace controlling ants and fruit flies keeping winemaking and storage areas clean etc etc 
wash equipment before and after use 
washing the winemaking equipment just before use is necessary for good sanitation washing the equipment immediately after use saves the winemaker a great deal of time grape residues are easy to wash away when wet but dried residues are very difficult to remove 
spray nozzle 
a hose equipped with a good spray nozzle is a necessity in the crush area the nozzle should produce a fine spray and a solid stream the hose and nozzle will be dropped from time to time so the nozzle should be well designed and constructed of strong materials hang the hose from a hook conveniently placed in the crush area because the hose and nozzle will be used often 
hoses 
transfer hoses can remain wet for long periods and then mildew can grow on the inside surfaces hoses should be washed immediately after use and hung on a wall with both ends down and the hoses will drain completely full strength clorox will remove mold and other stains from the inside surfaces of hoses or other difficult to reach places however surfaces treated with clorox must be rinsed carefully use clorox with care and do not breathe the fumes 
dirty bottles 
dirty wine bottles usually contain mold yeast and a variety of bacteria dirty bottles are always a potential source of contamination and home winemakers should not store dirty bottles in the winemaking area the bottles should be washed as they are collected then the clean bottles should be stored upside down in clean cardboard cases 
liquid dish washing detergents are difficult to rinse away when used for washing old wine bottles and they can leave unsightly water spots a cup of automatic dishwasher powder in three gallons of very hot water cleans bottles well and the residue rinses cleanly a teaspoon of liquid detergent should be added to the dishwasher powder if the water is hard 
power bottle brush 
most bottle brushes have a loop on the end of the wine handle some home winemakers remove the loop and chuck the wine handle in an electric drill this power bottle brush will remove stubborn bottle residues quickly however this method must be used with care and only with low drill speeds 
jet bottle washer 
a jet carboy washer attached to a water facet or hose is a great convenience for washing old wine bottles these washers are made of brass and they last for many years the washers are inexpensive and they save much time and large amounts of hot water 
auto wheel brush 
brushes with long handles can be purchased in large automotive supply stores these stiff bristled brushes are used for washing auto hub caps and wheels but home winemakers find them handy for scrubbing all kinds of winemaking equipment the long handles make these brushes particularly useful for scrubbing the inside surfaces of small fermenters and tanks 
fermentation techniques 
this section contains practical information and several suggestions on how to cope with some common problems encountered during primary fermentation 
under ripe grapes 
trying to make a dry red table wine from under ripe grapes is seldom successful when under ripe fruit is used wine flavor and bouquet will be lacking and wine color will be poor most red grape varieties are not ripe until the sugar level reaches 22 to 23 brix unfortunately home winemakers often have little control over when their grapes are picked and under ripe fruit is often encountered most under ripe red grapes are best used to make blush wines the low alcohol content skimpy flavors and the high acid levels are more appropriate for light fruity blush wine 
white grapes are not ripe until the sugar level reaches about 22 brix and chardonnay grapes are often picked well above 23 brix riesling grapes on the other hand are usually picked at low brix values before they lose their greenish color overripe white grapes are often best used for producing dessert wines at the other extreme under ripe white grapes can be used to produce excellent sparkling wines 
adding sugar to under ripe grapes seldom produces high quality wine the sugar increases the alcohol content but the added sugar does nothing to improve the poor color the puny flavors or the lack of varietal intensity sugared wines are usually too alcoholic pale colored and under flavored in addition under ripe red grapes often produce wine with unpleasant green or vegetal characteristics 
sulfur dioxide 
making and aging high quality table wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult and most winemakers add small quantities of sulfur dioxide when the grapes are crushed about 1/2 level teaspoon of sulfite powder for every 100 pounds of grapes is the right amount 
practically all of the free sulfur dioxide disappears during fermentation so winemakers add 1/4 level teaspoons of sulfite powder for every five gallons of wine when fermentation is complete this quantity of sulfite powder will add about 40 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide to the new wine however about half the sulfur dioxide will combine with other materials in the wine quickly so only 20 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide remains in the new wine the sulfite powder should be dissolved in an ounce or two of water before it is added to the wine 
wine should always be tested just before bottling time and the free sulfur dioxide content should be adjusted to about 25 milligrams per liter wines bottled with less than 20 to 30 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide oxidize quickly and they are short lived table 15 shows how much sulfite powder is needed to produce 25 50 and 75 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide in various quantities of wine the values given are in grams for example table 15 shows that 5 8 grams of sulfite powder

besides the sulfur problem yeast often produces objectionable quantities of hydrogen sulfide gas when the grapes lack nitrogen micro nutrients or vitamins commercial wineries and some home winemakers added small quantities of yeast nutrients and a substance called pantothenic acid to fermentations specifically to reduce the production of hydrogen sulfide pantothenic acid is a common vitamin and it can be purchased at any drugstore 
crushing by hand 
a mechanical crusher is not necessary for making red wine several hundred pounds of fruit can be crushed in a few hours using the following technique 1 put a clean plastic milk crate on a clean plastic trash can 
 2 put a few pounds of grapes in the crate 3 scrub the grapes through the holes in the bottom of the crate into the trash can 4 remove the stems from the crate 5 add a few more pounds of fruit and repeat some grapes will not be crushed but whole grapes are not a problem the juice from the uncrushed grapes will be recovered when the fermentation is pressed 
punching down 
a handy gadget for punching down small fermentations can be made quickly with a few hand tools find a small block of wood and an old broom stick a 6 x 6 x 12 inch piece of wood is fine the exact size is not important bore a hole in the middle of the wood block apply glue and insert the broom stick the new puncher downer will be easier to keep clean if it is finished with three or four coats of varnish 
skin contact time
most of the red pigment and fruit flavors are extracted during the first few days of skin contact four or five days of skin contact are enough to produce a quality product when the grapes are ripe tannins continue to be extracted for many days 
cooling hot fermentations 
fermentations can become violent when warm red grapes are fermented in hot weather much heat is produced and yeast cells can die when fermentation temperatures exceed 90 degrees for several hours such conditions require prompt action and fermentation temperature must be reduced quickly stainless steel containers can be cooled easily by flowing cold water over the outside surfaces sometimes small wineries use blocks of dry ice to cool hot fermentations home winemakers often fill plastic milk containers with clean water and keep the containers in their freezer later the sealed containers of ice can be placed in hot fermentations to reduce the temperature all winemakers try to avoid fermenting hot fruit 
completing fermentation 
fermentation may be complete when three conditions are met first check if the bubbling has stopped and make sure the wine is still and quiet second make sure the hydrometer reads less than zero brix third measure the brix for several days and be sure the hydrometer reading remains constant 
beginning winemakers often have trouble deciding when fermentation has finished the above procedure is useful but the only way to be sure fermentation has finished is to measure the residual sugar in the wine clinitest tablets can be purchased at most large drugstores and these tablets are a very convenient way of measuring small quantities of sugar in wine use the 5 drop method when the sugar content measures less than 1/4 percent the wine is considered dry 
short range hydrometers 
 plus and minus five short range hydrometers are very useful for monitoring sugar content near the end of fermentation these hydrometers have a special scale zero brix is in the center of the scale and plus five degrees and minus five degrees run in each direction from the zero point the scale is large and 0 1 degree brix can be read easily 
cellar techniques 
cellar operations start when fermentation is complete and continues until the wine is released cellar operations include clarification stabilization bulk aging etc 
hot and cold stabilization 
all white and blush wines should be both hot and cold stabilized before bottling many winemakers use the following technique to accomplish both stabilization steps in a single operation three teaspoons of dry bentonite and a cup of hot water are used for each 5 gallons of wine the water is placed in the blender and the blender is run at high speed while the bentonite is added slowly the bentonite mixture is chilled in a refrigerator for 24 hours and then the mixture is stirred into the wine after the bentonite addition the wine is placed in a refrigerator and the temperature control is set to the coldest position after a couple of weeks in the refrigerator the cold wine is racked into a clean container bubbling and splashing should be minimized because cold wine oxidizes easily 
gelatin 
gelatins are useful for fining astringent red wines and a suitable gelatin can be found in the canning section of most grocery stores knox gelatin comes in a box containing four handy pre measured envelopes be sure to buy an un flavored gelatin 
power stirring tool 
small wine containers can be mixed easily with a clean wooden dowel however stirring a barrel or small tank of wine is not so easy and a special stirring tool can be very helpful a variety of stirring tools can be purchased or a propeller type stirrer can be made easily first form a small propeller by cutting and bending a piece of stainless steel sheet drill a hole in the center of the propeller blade and bolt the blade to a 36 inch length of 1/4 inch stainless steel rod secure the propeller with two stainless steel nuts and washers a barrel of wine or a small tank can be quickly mixed with the homemade stirrer and a small electric drill 
oak chips 
many home winemakers add oak chips to red wines stored in glass plastic or stainless containers about 2 oz of oak chips for every 10 gallons of wine is a good starting quantity the chips can be placed in a nylon bag and suspended in the wine or the chips can be added directly to the container after the chips are added the wine should be tasted twice a month to make sure the wine does not get too oakey when the wine has the desired oak character remove the bag of chips or rack the wine off the loose chips into a clean container if more oak character is wanted additional chips can be added anytime 
wine filter 
inexpensive but effective wine filters can be made from standard 10 inch cartridge type water filters these filters are available at hardware stores and a variety of cartridges are manufactured to fit these standard housings five micron water filter cartridges are available at hardware stores these cartridges are inexpensive and they are useful for rough filtering large quantities of wine however a 5 micron cartridge is quite porous and will not completely clarify dirty wine one micron cartridges are used for general clarification and many home winemakers use cartridges with 0 5 or 0 2 micron ratings for filtering wine at bottling time 
wine filter use 
all filter media should be washed before any wine is filtered first completely assemble the filter system and then flush the system with several gallons of clean water the water coming out of the filter should be tasted to make sure no paper taste remains if the rinse water tastes clean the filter is drained and used 
washing is continued if the water has a paper taste some winemakers prefer to wash the complete filter system with a 1 percent citric acid solution the citric acid seems to remove the paper taste quickly and the acid helps sterilize the filter after the acid solution is removed the filter system is washed with clean water a short length of plastic tubing permanently attached to a hose connector is handy for flushing small filters 
storing used filter cartridges 
used filter cartridges are difficult to maintain but the following method works well immediately after use the filter should be back flushed with several gallons of clean water then the water is drained and the housing is filled with a 50% ethyl alcohol solution inexpensive 100 proof vodka the inlet and outlet of the housing should be tightly sealed with small rubber stoppers and the filter should be stored in a cool dry place when the filter is needed drain the alcohol and flush the housing with clean water set the alcohol aside so it can be reused later 
bottling 
bottling is the last major step in the winemaking process lots of things can go wrong so bottling is a difficult operation for many home winemakers ways of avoiding several common bottling problems are discussed below 
bottling supplies 
in 1997 sealed bags of one thousand number one wine corks sold for about 135 the cost of new glass ranged from 4 50 to 6 50 per case and re sterilized glass sold for 3 50 to 4 50 a case a carton of 4800 fancy heat shrink capsules sold for 130 
handling bottles 
plastic milk crates are a convenient way of handling wine bottles plastic crates are handy containers for washing used bottles and for filling bottles these crates are strong enough to hold full bottles easily milk crates are easy to keep clean and they are always handy to have in any home winery standard size plastic milk crates hold about 20 bottles 
softening corks 
hard corks can be softened by soaking in cold water for a few hours excessive cork water is undesirable because the water stains the top of the corks and makes a mess after soaking the excess water should be poured off then the container of corks should be covered with a clean cloth and the corks should be allowed to drain overnight 
old corks can be softened quickly in a microwave oven rinse the corks in cold water and then seal the wet corks in a plastic freezer bag heat the bag of corks in a microwave oven for a short time a bag containing 50 corks might require a one minute exposure at a 50 percent power setting however the time depends on the microwave oven and some experimentation may be needed corks burn easily so always use the minimum power and time necessary the intense microwave energy may also be effective in sterilizing the corks please note this technique should not be used with paraffin coated corks 
bottle filling 
always avoid oxidation by not splashing or bubbling the wine when bottles are filled small pressure heads reduce bubbling so the wine container should be just two or three feet higher than the bottles bottles should be filled from the bottom slowly until no more than 1/4 inch gap remains between the wine and the bottom of the cork the small pressure head increases time needed to fill the bottles however filling time can be reduced significantly by using a large 1/2 inch diameter wand type bottle filler 
making labels 
inexpensive labels can be made easily with a home computer a variety of art work can be included and professional quality labels can be produced easily if a scanner and color printer are available most light weight papers wrinkle badly when the glue is applied but many medium weight bond papers are suitable for labels four six or eight labels should be made from standard 8 5 x 11 inch sheets of paper and very little paper will be wasted if the layout is done carefully 
label paster 
small wineries use a label pasting machine when small lots are labeled by hand these handy machines quickly apply just the right amount of glue to the back surface of any label unfortunately these little machines sell for several hundred dollars and most home winemakers do not produce enough wine to justify the cost 
gluing labels by hand 
white elmers glue is often a satisfactory adhesive for applying labels printed on heavy weight paper use a wide short bristled brush to apply glue to the back of the labels pasting is easier when a piece of stiff cardboard smaller than the label is used the label is placed face down on the cardboard and then the glue is applied with the brush a glue stick is a very convenient adhesive when only a few bottles are being labeled 
summary 
some winemaking procedures are done only once each year so several crush seasons are needed for novice winemakers to develop certain skills beginning winemakers can learn basic winemaking techniques and get many useful ideas by visiting other home winemakers or small commercial wineries and visiting other winemakers is always an enjoyable way to gain practical information quickly 
chapter 23 

laboratory wine testing 
about 30 tons of grapes are required to make 5000 gallons of wine high quality fruit might cost 1500 per ton so the grapes needed to fill a 5000 gallon tank can cost 45 000 losing a tank of wine can be very expensive so commercial winemakers depend on laboratory wine measurements to minimize the number of gross wine failures laboratory measurements also help winemakers produce wines more consistent in style and quality from year to year consequently laboratory measurements are indispensable in commercial wineries and they play an important role in most home winemaking programs 
large wineries maintain extensive in house laboratory facilities containing much expensive equipment on the other hand many small wineries cannot afford extensive measurement facilities because the equipment is too expensive most small wineries rely on basic wine tests that can be done with a minimum amount of apparatus and they depend on the winemakers nose to provide much of the needed information 
noses can detect and identify extremely small quantities of many different materials so noses are wonderful measurement tools for quickly determining the condition of wine noses are always available unless the winemaker has a cold and an educated nose is the most valuable measurement tool any winemaker possesses 
the equipment and methods for doing six basic wine measurements are discussed below 
brix 
sugar in juice or wine is measured using the brix scale this scale was developed specifically for winemaking and one degree brix is equal to one gram of sugar per 100 grams of juice winemakers usually measure brix with an optical refractometer or a hydrometer 
sugar content is one of several criteria used to judge fruit maturity and most grapes are picked when the sugar content is between 20 and 25 brix winemakers start measuring grape sugars several weeks before harvest time and they continue sugar testing until the fruit is picked 
taking hydrometer readings during fermentation is important most winemakers measure brix at least once each day to monitor the speed and consistence of their fermentations moderate drops in sugar each day shows normal fermentation if an unusual change in sugar level is observed the winemaker can make corrections promptly 
novice winemakers often believe fermentation is complete when their hydrometers measure zero 
however alcohol has a density less than water so hydrometers read less than zero brix when a completely dry wine is measured dry white table wines usually measure 1 8 to 2 4 brix and dry red table wines measure 1 4 to 2 2 brix because of the accumulated alcohol 
brix measurement materials 
sugar can be accurately measured using inexpensive 20 short range brix hydrometers many winemakers use a set of three instruments one instrument reads from 16 to 24 degrees brix the second instrument reads from 8 to 16 degrees and the third hydrometer reads + 5 to 5 brix all three hydrometers are calibrated in 0 1 brix steps some home winemakers rely on a single hydrometer with a zero to 30 degree brix scale these long range instruments are inexpensive and readily available unfortunately these long range hydrometers are difficult to read accurately 
the following materials are needed to measure the sugar content of juice 
brix hydrometers 
a hydrometer cylinder 

brix measurement procedure 
hydrometers are made from very thin glass they are fragile and these instruments must be handled carefully the following procedure can be used to measure brix in juice 
1 
strain un clarified juice to remove the solids 

2 
fill the hydrometer cylinder within a few inches of the top with juice 

3 
gently lower the hydrometer in the liquid and give it a slight twist motion the twist will release any bubbles sticking to the glass 

4 
 when the hydrometer is floating freely wait a few seconds and then read the hydrometer scale read the scale in line with the bottom of the meniscus curve 

5 
record the reading 

6 
discard the sample and rinse the cylinder and hydrometer with clean water 

titratable acid 
titratable acid ta is a measure of the sum of all the organic acids in juice or wine in healthy wine the major acids are tartaric and malic but all wines contain small quantities of citric succinic acetic butyric lactic and other organic acids in the united states wine acidity is expressed as if all of the acids in the wine were tartaric acid the titratable acid of juice ranges from 0 4 to 1 2 grams per 100 milliliters of liquid one hundred milliliters of juice weighs approximately 100 grams so grams per 100 ml is roughly equal to percent 
the tart of wine is strongly related to titratable acid when wine contains too much acid it will be very tart or even sour tasting when too little acid is present wine often lacks freshness and tastes flat grapes grown in warm areas are usually low in acid and additions of tartaric acid are often needed to produce a balanced wine ta is always measured when the grapes are crushed so any needed acid adjustments can be made before fermentation is started ta is also used to judge fruit maturity at harvest time the titratable acid of normal wine slowly decreases as the wine ages and any rise in wine ta during the aging period is a danger signal to the winemaker when the ta rises acetic acid may be forming and the wine may be turning into vinegar therefore most winemakers measure titratable acid periodically from the time fermentation is complete until the wine is bottled small producers often measure titratable acid once each month but many large producers measure the ta twice a month 
titratable acid of wine or juice can be measured by several different analytical techniques however most wineries use a titration method this measurement procedure is simple and the laboratory apparatus is inexpensive 
acid measurement materials 
titratable acid can be measured by a simple titration procedure using a calibrated 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution phenolphthalein solution is used as an indicator to show the titration end point 
the following materials are needed to measure the titratable acid of white wine blush wine and juice 
5 ml serological transfer pipette 
10 ml serological transfer pipette 
250 ml erlenmeyer flask 

0 1 normal sodium hydroxide 
1% phenolphthalein solution 
distilled water 

titratable acid measurement procedure 
this procedure is satisfactory for measuring the titratable acid of juices and white or blush wines 
1 
draw 5 milliliters ml of juice or wine into the 5 ml pipette 

2 
transfer the sample into the flask 

3 
add about 50 ml of distilled water and three or four drops of phenolphthalein solution 

4 
fill the 10 ml pipette with 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution 

5 
 titrate with the sodium hydroxide while mixing the wine sample by rocking the flask 

6 
stop titration when the sample turns a faint pink 

7 
record the quantity of sodium hydroxide solution used 

8 
rinse the flask and pipettes with clean water 

titratable acid calculations 
titratable acid can be calculated using the following formula 
a ta % 0 15 x milliliters of sodium hydroxide used 
in the above formula the titratable acid is given in grams of acid per 100 ml of wine percent and ta is 
expressed as if all of the acids in the wine were tartaric acid 
two examples of how titratable acid is calculated from the measured data follow 

example # 1 
a white wine sample was titrated drop by drop during titration the sample was mixed by rocking the flask from side to side a faint but persistent pink color was reached and the pipette scale was read in this example the scale showed 5 3 ml of sodium hydroxide had been added to the sample the titratable acid of the sample was calculated by multiplying 0 15 times 5 3 this gave a ta of 0 79 grams of acid per 100 milliliters of wine or 0 79 percent 
example # 2 
a pipette was used to add 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution to a red wine sample the titration was done slowly so the stir bar could keep the sample mixed and the ph meter was carefully watched titration was stopped when the meter read 8 2 the pipette scale was read and it showed 3 9 ml of sodium hydroxide had been added to the sample the acidity of the red wine sample was calculated by multiplying 0 15 times 
3 9 which give 0 58 grams per 100 milliliters 0 58 percent an alternative 
procedure for red wines 
the above procedure does not work well for dark red wines because the end point is very difficult to recognize in dark red wines diluting red wine samples with up to 200 milliliters of water makes the measurement easier but most winemakers prefer to use the following procedure when testing dark red wines however a ph meter ring stand and a magnetic stirrer are required for this procedure see ph measurement below 
1 
place the probe in a ring stand clamp and arrange the stand so the probe is centered above the stirrer plate 

2 
draw 5 milliliters ml of wine into the pipette and transfer it into the beaker 

3 
add about 50 ml of distilled water and place the stir bar in the beaker 

4 
place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the ring stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe 

5 
turn the stirrer on 

6 
fill the pipette with 0 1 n sodium hydroxide solution 7 titrate the wine sample while watching the ph meter 


8 stop the titration when the ph meter reads 8 2 
8 
record the quantity of sodium hydroxide used 

9 
discard the wine sample and rinse the probe beaker stir bar and the pipettes several times with clean water 

free sulfur dioxide 
winemakers try to maintain 20 to 40 milligrams per liter of free so2 in their wine from the completion of fermentation until the wine is bottled but the amount of free so2 does not remain constant sulfur dioxide is consumed as it does its job and the free sulfur dioxide slowly decreases with time consequently winemakers measure the free sulfur dioxide in their wines every few weeks and they make appropriate additions to maintain the sulfur dioxide near the desired level 
so2 measurement materials 
5 ml serological pipette 
10 ml serological pipette 
250 ml clear glass container 
dilute sulfuric acid 1 part acid in 3 parts water 
1% starch solution 

0 01 n iodine solution 
distilled water 

the starch indicator solution is made by mixing one half teaspoon of corn starch in about 200 ml of water and boiling the mixture for a few minutes the starch solution can be used when it is cool but a fresh solution should be made every week or so starch solutions are prepared commercially and these solutions last for several months 
a 0 01 normal iodine solution is a weak solution and weak iodine solutions are not stable weak iodine solutions should be stored in dark brown glass bottles and the bottle should be tightly stoppered and stored in a dark place even then the calibration normality of the iodine solution will change slowly 
free so2 measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to measure the amount of free sulfur dioxide in juice or wine 
1 
draw exactly 10 milliliters ml of wine into the pipette and transfer the wine into a small clear glass container 

2 
add about 5 ml of diluted sulfuric acid h2so4 to the wine sample 

3 
add 2 or 3 ml of the starch solution to the sample 

4 
immediately fill the 5 ml pipette with the iodine solution and titrate the wine sample until a faint purple color is reached this is the end point the purple color will fade in a few seconds but do not add more iodine 

5 
record the quantity of iodine solution used to reach the end point 

6 
rinse the pipettes and the glass container several times in clean water and place them in drying racks 

most commercial wineries routinely use the iodine method to measure sulfur dioxide in white and blush wines however this method is not very accurate when used with red wines because phenolic materials in red wines also react with the iodine these side reactions can give erroneously high results and measured values of free sulfur dioxide can be more than 20 percent too high 
besides the side reactions the end point is difficult to recognize in dark red wines generally a distinct purple color does not occur when red wines are titrated instead a slight darkening of the wine color indicates the end point diluting red wine with distilled water often makes the end point easier to recognize and as much as 150 ml of water is sometimes used viewing the diluted red wine with a strong yellow sidelight is often helpful some winemakers have a 75 watt yellow bug light in a desk lamp specifically for measuring sulfur dioxide in red wines measuring sulfur dioxide in dark red wines with the iodine method requires some practice 
sulfur dioxide calculations 
the amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine sample is calculated from the measured volume of the iodine solution used in the titration and from the normality of the iodine the formula for free so2 can be written as 
so2 3200 x volume of iodine x normality of iodine 
in the above formula the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine sample is given in milligrams of sulfur dioxide per liter of wine mg/l 
two examples of how free sulfur dioxide is calculated from the measured data are given below 
example # 1 
a faint purple color was produced when 2 2 milliliters of 0 01 n iodine solution was added to 10 milliliters of white wine the free so2 level of this wine was obtained by multiplying 3200 times 2 2 the quantity of iodine solution times 0 01 the normality of the iodine solution the multiplication 3200 x 2 2 x 01 gives 70 4 milligrams per liter of free sulfur dioxide 
example # 2 
a dark red wine sample was diluted with about 100 milliliters of distilled water when 1 2 ml of 0 01 n iodine solution was added to the wine sample the color darkened slightly the free so2 level of this red wine was calculated by multiplying 3200 times 1 2 times 0 01 this measurement gave 38 4 milligrams per liter mg/l of free sulfur dioxide 
ph 
ph is one of several parameters used to judge fruit maturity and most winemakers start monitoring the ph of the grapes several weeks before harvest time ph also gives the winemaker important information about how much sulfur dioxide is needed to control microbes wine stability characteristics are dependent on ph 
red wine color is influenced by ph red wines with low ph values have more and better red color wines with high ph values have a dull less attractive color winemakers monitor wine ph every few weeks until the wine is bottled 
ph measurement materials 
a ph meter with a three digit resolution is the only practical way of measuring ph and an instrument with a separate probe on a 36 inch cable is a great convenience for wine measurements all ph meters should be calibrated just before use and most instruments have long warm up times 
ph meter 
ph probe 

7 00 standard ph solution 
4 00 standard ph solution 
100 ml beaker 
ring stand 
magnetic stirrer

ph measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to measure the ph of any wine must or juice 
1 	
place the probe in the ring stand clamp and arrange the stand so the probe is centered above the stirrer plate 

2 
place 30 or 40 milliliters of the 7 00 standard solution in the beaker 

3 
place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe turn the stirrer on 

4

place 30 or 40 milliliters of wine or juice in the beaker 

11 
place the beaker on the stirrer plate adjust the stand so the probe is emersed in the sample but do not allow the stir bar to strike the end of the probe turn on the stirrer 

12 
wait a few seconds then read the ph meter and record the value 

13 
rinse the probe beaker and stir bar in clean water 

residual sugar 
fermentation can restart in wine containing sugar anytime so winemakers always measure the residual sugar contents of their wines shortly after fermentation to be sure no sugar remains large wineries use a wet chemistry method but small wineries and home winemakers use clinitest tablets to measure residual sugars in wine this measurement method is simple and it provides reasonable accuracy when the residual sugar content is less than about 2 percent clinitest tablets are sold in most large drugstores tablets and a special color chart can also be ordered from winemaking supply companies 
residual sugar measurement materials 
the following equipment can be used to measure the residual sugar content of any table wine 
eye dropper 
small clear container 
clinitest tablets 
clinitest color chart 
residual sugar measurement procedure 
this procedure can be used to measure the residual sugar content in any wine containing less than 2 percent sugar wines with higher values of sugar can be measured by diluting the wine appropriately measurements are made by comparing the color of a treated wine sample to the color on a calibrated chart 
 however the color pigments in red wines do not seem to cause significant errors 
directions and a color chart are provided with the clinitest tablets 
1 
draw a small amount of wine into the eye dropper 

2 
place 5 drops of wine in the clear container 

3 
rinse the eye dropper carefully several times with clean water 

4 
draw a small amount of distilled water into the eye dropper 

5 
place 10 drops of distilled water in the clear container 

6 
place one clinitest tablet in the container 

7 
after the boiling stops wait 15 seconds then read the sugar content by comparing the color of the liquid to the colors on the chart 

8 
rinse the eye dropper and the small container several times with clean water 

clinitest tablets are sensitive to moisture so the bottle should be kept tightly sealed 
chromatography 
most winemakers measure the malic acid content of their red wines when fermentation is complete they want to know ml fermentation is complete and if all the malic acid is gone an additional treatment may be needed to stabilize the wine when malic acid remains and paper chromatography is a simple and reliable means of determining what kinds of organic acids are present in wine 
yeasts produce small quantities of lactic acid during primary fermentation so all wine contains some lactic acid therefore the progress of ml fermentations should be judged by the disappearance of malic acid not by the appearance of lactic acid ml fermentation is considered finished when the malic acid spot completely disappears 
ml chromatography materials 
the following materials are needed to measure ml fermentation status in any wine 
a 1 gallon wide mouthed jar 
ml solvent 
ml paper 
micro pipettes capillary tubes 
standard malic acid solution 

ml measurement procedure 
the following procedure can be used to identify and estimate the quantities of tartaric citric malic and lactic acids in wine or juice 
1 
place a sheet of chromatography paper on a clean surface use clean hands and try to hold the paper by its edges 

2 
make a light pencil line along a long side about 3/4 inches up from the bottom and then make marks about 1 1/4 inches apart along the pencil line label each mark either as the malic acid standard or for each of the wine samples being measured the first mark on the left is commonly used for the malic acid standard 

3 
use capillary tubes to draw up a small quantity of the acid standard and wine samples do not allow any contact between the tubes 

4 
touch the end of each tube to the mark on the line very quickly the wet spots should not be larger than about 1/4 inch in diameter 

5 
allow the spots to dry and then repeat the above step twice 3 applications let the dots dry between each application 

6 
pour enough ml solution into the wide mouthed jar to cover the bottom the solvent should cover about 1/8 inch of the bottom edge of the paper the solvent should not come up to the pencil line 

7 
when all of the dots are completely dry staple the short sides of the paper together forming a cylinder 

8 
stand the paper cylinder upright in the jar with the pencil line near the bottom and place the cover on the jar 

9 
let the jar stand until the solvent front has climbed nearly to the top of the paper six or more hours 

10 
remove the paper from the jar pour the ml solvent back into the original container wash and dry the jar and discard the capillary tubes 

remove the staples from the sheet of paper and hang the paper in a well ventilated place the chromatogram can be read when the paper is completely dry 
appendix a 

step by step winemaking 
in southern california the annual grape crushes usually starts in mid august and ends in early october many factors influence grape ripening time including grape variety temperature soils irrigation practice sun light etc 
fruit 
 wine quality is made in the vineyard and high quality wine can only be made from quality fruit 
when grapes are picked too early the wine may be high in acid low in alcohol and lack fruit flavors and 
aromas 
when grapes are picked too late the wine is often low in acid high in alcohol and has stewed fruit raisin or 
prune flavors 
 second crop fruit often makes poor quality wine 
professional winemakers get 150 to 180 gallons per ton but home winemakers seldom get more than 140 
to 150 gallons 
bulk wine containers must be topped up regularly and kept completely full so winemakers always produce 
extra wine 

nominal sugar levels
 17 to 19 brix for sparkling wine 
 19 to 22 brix for blush and light white wines 
 22 to 24 brix for chardonnay and sauvignon blanc 
 23 to 25 brix for most red wines 

grape processing 
grapes can deteriorate quickly on a hot day 
boxes of picked grapes should not be left in the hot sun 
grapes should be moved to the winemaking area quickly 
winemakers prefer fruit picked early in the morning when the grapes are cold 

crusher 
for most home winemakers a hand crank crusher is the most practical method of crushing fruit both single and double roller crushers work well 
good machines crank easily but poorly designed and poorly constructed machines do not power crusher/stemmers crush the grapes and remove the stems in one simple fast operation removing the stems from white grapes is not necessary if the grapes will be pressed immediately stems can be removed from red fermentations by hand using the following technique 
 1 
 place a clean plastic milk crate on top of a clean plastic trash can 

 2 
 place a few pounds of crushed fruit in the bottom of the milk crate and use a scrubbing motion 

 3 
 the crushed fruit will drop through the crate 

 4 
 discard the stems from the crate and repeat the process 

sulfur dioxide so2 
making quality table wine without using small quantities of sulfur dioxide is difficult 
sulfur dioxide helps control native yeast and bacteria 
sulfur dioxide also reduces oxidation of the must and wine 
usually about 35 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide is added when the grapes are crushed 
one half level teaspoon of sulfite powder in 100 pounds of grapes is the correct amount 
the sulfite should be dissolved in a small amount of water and then stirred into the crushed grapes 

press 
small quantities of red wine can be made without a press but a wine press is necessary to make white wine the following procedure works well with small vertical basket presses 
 1 
 fill the basket add the top plates blocks and press head 

 2 
 apply a small amount of pressure until the liquid flows 

 3 
 when the flow decreases increase the pressure 

 4 
 excessive foam between the basket slats show pressing is being done too quickly 

 5 when the flow stops disassemble the press crumble the press cake and repress most home winemakers crumble the press cake two or three times when pressing expensive grapes ratchet type basket presses can produce high pressures but high pressures often produce harsh bitter wines moderate pressures are desirable and the fruit should be pressed slowly 
juice and must corrections 
acid content titratable acid strongly influences the taste of the wine 
wine can taste flat and insipid when the acid content is too low 
wine tastes too tart when the acid is too high 
grapes grown in warm areas are often low in titratable acid 
titratable acid should be between 0 65 and 0 85 percent before fermentation 
small quantities of tartaric acid should be added to the must if the acid level is lower than 0 65 percent 
acid crystals should be dissolved in a small amount of water before the acid is added to the must 
stir the must well and then re measure the acid content 
only small amounts of acid should be added at a time 

sugar corrections 
ordinary white table sugar can be used for sugar additions 
low sugar is not a problem in california 
if the sugar content is too low the grapes are not mature 
high quality table wines cannot be made from immature grapes 
grapes lacking sugar should be harvested later in the season when the fruit is fully ripe 

yeast nutrients 
yeast requires nitrogen vitamins and several other materials to reproduce new yeast cells and ferment the 
grape sugars 
grapes deficient in these materials can be difficult to ferment unless extra nutrients are added 
chardonnay juice deficient in nitrogen occurs regularly so winemakers often add extra nitrogen to all 
chardonnay juice 
directions for yeast nutrients should be followed carefully to avoid off flavors in the wine 

settling white juice 
fresher white table wines are produced when bits of skin pulp and other debris is removed from juice 
before fermentation 
when the solids have been removed fermentations are cleaner and better controlled 
juice is often settled over night and then the clear juice is racked off the sediment the next day 
the juice must be kept cold and the proper amount of sulfur dioxide should be used 
sometimes additional clear juice can be obtained by resettling the residue 

fermentation 
grape skins have a waxy coating and the coating is covered with native yeasts 
native yeast can spontaneously ferment grapes without the winemaker adding additional yeast 
sulfur dioxide is used to arrest yeast activity but reasonable quantities will not kill the yeast 
most winemakers prefer to add pure cultured yeast to start fermentation 

cultured yeast 
most home winemakers prefer dry yeast because using it is easier 
some yeasts like epernay does not tolerate high levels of alcohol 
steinberg yeast does not tolerate high levels of sulfur dioxide 
montrachet yeast produces more hydrogen sulfide rotten egg smell than many other yeasts montrachet 
should never be used with grapes containing residual sulfur dust 
pasteur champagne yeast can produce large amounts of foam in warm fermentation 
small wineries often use dry prise de mousse yeast to ferment all of their wines 
the type of yeast used has little impact on the flavor of aged wine 

dry yeast rehydration 
yeast manufacturers recommend rehydrating dry yeast 
dry yeast is rehydrated by adding a small amount of warm water 
about a cup of water should be used for each teaspoon of yeast 
the water temperature should be between 95 and 100 degrees 
after stirring the yeast mixture should stand for 30 minutes 
most winemakers use about one gram of dry yeast for each gallon of must or juice 

white fermentations 
fermentation temperature is one of the most important factors for producing quality white table wines 
light fruity white wines like riesling are always fermented at temperatures ranging from 40 to 55 degrees 
at these low temperatures white fermentations often continue for two or three weeks 
heavier style white wines are often fermented at temperatures between 55 and 65 degrees 
white juice should always be settled over night 
only the clarified juice is fermented 
white wines are always fermented in closed containers sealed with a fermentation trap 
all fermentations should be monitored by measuring the brix each day 
when fermentation is complete the new wine should be racked into a clean container and 50 milligrams 
per liter of so2 should be added 

red fermentations 
red grapes have colorless juice 
the color is in the grape skins 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp seeds and skins together for several days 
lengthy skin contact does not increase color but it does increase wine astringency 
short skin contact time produces softer more fruity red wines 
skin contact time is always a compromise and winemaking experience is needed 
usually four to seven days is adequate for red fermentations 
 when in doubt press early is a good rule to follow 
a cap of skins will begin to float after fermentation starts 
if the cap becomes dry vinegar bacteria can grow and convert the alcohol into vinegar 
to prevent this acetification problem the cap should be broken up periodically and kept wet 
caps on small fermentations will not be very thick and small caps can be managed by stirring the 
fermentation twice a day 
on larger fermentations a special tool is needed to punch the cap down into the juice 
caps should be punched down twice a day 
more punching down will do no harm and it may improve the color of the wine 

pressing red must 
red musts are usually pressed in a basket press and the procedure is the same as pressing white juices see above 
small red fermentations can by pressed by hand if the grapes were thoroughly crushed the following procedure works well 
 1 
 cut a piece of 3/4 inch thick plywood to fit inside a plastic milk crate 

 2 
 let the cap rise and then the liquid can be carefully siphoned off 

 3 
 the plastic milk crate is placed on a suitable container and a piece of plastic window screen is placed in the bottom of the crate 

 4 
 fill the crate half full of pomace and place the plywood on top 

 5 
 press by hand and then place a heavy weight on the plywood 

 6 let the crate drain for 15 or 20 minutes and then stir the pomace and repeat after pressing red wine should be placed in a closed container and the container should be sealed with a fermentation lock when fermentation is complete the new wine should be racked off the gross lees and 50 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide added 
cellar operations 
cellar operations include wine clarification stabilization bulk aging bottling and bottle aging 
clarification 
clarification is accomplished by racking fining and filtration 
most white and blush wines will need to be clarified by fining with sparkolloid 
most red wines become clear automatically 
red wines are often fined with protein materials such as a gelatin casein or egg whites to reduce 
astringency 
un flavored knox gelatin purchased at a grocery store can be used to remove red wine astringency 
one level teaspoon of dry gelatin powder for each 5 gallons of wine is an average dose 
the powder should be mixed in a cup of warm water 
the warm gelatin liquid should be added slowly while constantly stirring the wine 
after a week or so the wine should be racked off the fining lees 
a light gelatin fining can be effective in reducing the amount of bottle deposit 

stabilization 
stable wines remain clear after they are bottled 
unstable wines often change color produce hazes or throw ugly sediments after they are bottled 
wine is made stable by fining racking chilling adding sulfur dioxide and aging 
white and blush wines should be hot stabilized with bentonite 
two grams of dry bentonite per gallon of wine are often used but testing should be done 
the wine should be racked a week or so after adding the bentonite 
all white and blush wines should be cold stabilized by chilling the wine to about 28 degrees 
excess tartrate crystals precipitate when wine is chilled 
some wineries do both hot and cold stabilization treatments at one time by adding bentonite and then chilling 
the wine to the low temperature 
after a week or two the cold wine is filtered or racked off the bentonite lees 

white wines are normally racked two or three times before bottling 
red wines should be racked about every month for the first three months then twice a year 
the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine should be maintained at 25 to 30 milligrams per liter 

bulk aging wine 
aging is a natural process and no way has been found to speed up the process 
small amounts of oxygen are always present when wine is aged in the cask 
aging in the bottle takes place in an absence of oxygen 
light white wines and blush wines are usually bottled a few months after harvest 
chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are often bottled after six to 12 months 
most quality red wines are bottled after one to three years of barrel aging 
containers must be kept full and the sulfur dioxide must be maintained at 20 to 30 milligrams per liter 

oak 
oak wood can impart desirable flavors to wine 
oak flavors are best got by storing wine in oak barrels for extended periods 
barrels are expensive and they no longer produce the desirable flavors after four or five years 
oak chips can also produce oak flavors in wine 
the quantity of oak chips needed depends upon the style of the wine and personal preferences 
one to two ounces of chips for 5 gallons of wine is a good starting quantity 
the wine should be tasted every few weeks after the chips are added and the wine should be racked off 
the chips when the taste is satisfactory 
more chips can always be added but removing excess oak flavor from wine is difficult 
most aromatic wines riesling muscat etc do not benefit from oak aging 

bottling 
wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before bottling 
bottling is a simple operation but several points should be considered before the bottles are filled 

adjustments before bottling 
any blending should be done many weeks before bottling time so the winemaker can be sure the new blend 
is stable 
large additions of tartaric acid can make wine unstable and require additional cold stabilization 
usually small amounts of citric acid can be added to white wines without upsetting cold stability 
cold stability should be checked before bottling white or blush wines by placing a wine sample in the 
refrigerator for 48 hours 
hot stability should be checked by holding a sample of the wine at 120 degrees for 48 hours 
the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine should be tested and adjusted to about 30 milligrams per liter a 
day or two before bottling 

wines bottled with less than 30 milligrams per liter of sulfur dioxide will be short lived 
bottle filling 
clean bottles should be rinsed with very hot water just before filling 
then rinse each bottle with a sulfite solution and drain the bottles 
the sulfur dioxide solution is made by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of sulfite crystals and 2 teaspoon of citric acid in 
750 ml of water 
this sulfite solution is strong enough to kill bacteria but the bottles must be drained carefully 
a bottle filler of some kind should always be used to reduce wine oxidation 
bottles should be filled from the bottom and with a minimum amount of foam and splashing 
bottles should be filled until no more than 1/4 inch exists between the wine and the bottom of the cork 

corking 
driving dry corks is preferred 
some small hand corkers cannot compress dry corks adequately and presoaked corks must be used 
presoak corks in cold water for an hour or so to soften them 
a pinch of sulfite added to the water may help sterilize the corks 
drive corks flush or slightly below the lip of the bottle 
remove spilled wine from the bottles or the wine residue will become moldy 

labeling 
all bottles should have some kind of label to identify the contents 
attractive wine labels can be made with a home computer 
common white glue is often used for attaching wine labels 
a few labels can be applied quickly with a glue stick 
capsules and labels can be applied when the bottles are clean and dry 

bottle aging 
bottles should stand upright for a week or two after corking 
after the pressure has equalized bottles can be stored on their sides or upside down in a cool place 
red wines are usually aged in the bottle for one or more years to develop bottle bouquet 
heavier style white wines also benefit from bottle aging

high quality wine can only be made when high quality fruit is picked in optimum condition 
sulfur dioxide should be added to grapes when they are crushed 
juice acidity should be adjusted to 0 65 to 0 85 percent before fermentation is started 
white juice should be settled over night and fermentation temperatures should kept below 60 f 
red wine is made by fermenting the juice pulp seeds and skins together 
caps on red fermentations should be punched down at least twice a day 

four to seven days of fermentation time will be adequate for most red grape varieties 
about 50 milligrams per liter of so2 should be added when fermentation is complete 
wine is made stable by fining racking and chilling 
white and blush wines require both hot and cold stabilization treatments 
all wine must be brilliantly clear and stable before bottling 
the free so2 level should be raised to about 30 milligrams per liter a day or two before wine is bottled

this wine makers manual is dedicated to the 
government of the united states to all the state governments to the government of the dominion of canada and to the oenological experts of the province of ontario 
the american federal government at no time has done much of anything to help the wine maker either in the way of giving him technical guidance or in finding him foreign markets with two notable exceptions the state governments have done nothing california has taken the lead with marvelous scientific work new york has been of great aid by producing better varieties of wine grapes and has now begun scientific research in wine making included in which are experiments with more than ninety pure wine yeast cultures ontario has begun experimentation to provide better varieties of wine grapes 
with the exception of these two american states and one canadian province practically nothing has been done by constituted authority to help the wine maker the enormously big wineries do not need help except in the finding of foreign markets they have their own laboratories and experts the little ones do need guidance many a writer has said that the small wineries 
 5 
in europe and california produce a superior product governments should help them to reach perfection 
the neglect of the united states to help the wine maker is in sorry contrast with european practice the governments of france germany and italy especially provide scientific research instruction and foreign propaganda america can produce as good wine as any other nation on earth and vastly more of it the united states is one immense grape belt with no isothermal line limiting production

even cities according to tradition claimed to be the birthplace of homer and fully as many nations have asserted themselves as the original home of wine this proves of course that wine holds the same place among material things that immortal homer occupies in poetry china claims the genesis of wine so does egypt and so does greece armenia s claim goes back 
to the time when good old uncle noah departing from the ark which he scuttled on mount ararat planted himself a vineyard and got terribly drunk on new wine which served him right because no prudent man would do such a thing however persia deserves especial consideration because of the picturesque story which she has passed down through the ages it concerns the warrior monarch jamshyd he was fond of grapes and grapes in persia grow as marvelously as melons they were brought to jamshyd and all the ladies of his harem in amphorae now the grape capacity of jamshyd and his thirty or forty wives varied sometimes a lot of grapes would accumulate in an amphora the juice would trickle to

now it so happened that plump little sweeta babi of all the ladies of the harem loved jamshyd the best she loved him so much that she suffered from perpetual jealousy now jealousy as all men know makes a woman most unattractive and jamshyd neglected her this made her despondent and spoiled her appetite so she could only nibble not eat the grapes the juice sank and fermented she felt so bad that she wanted to die and bethought herself of the poison that had accumulated at the bottom of her amphora she took a drinking vessel doubtless the kind from whic h the old persians drank their orange juice lifted the amphora in her shapely and beautiful arms and poured herself a bumper of life extinguisher she raised the cup she drained it to the last drop she threw herself on her harem couch and got ready to die she began to tingle and the tingle brought happiness life seemed so good but jamshyd s love or nothing nothing at all the throes of death failed to arrive so she filled the cup again and lay down to die again many more tingles much more happiness to hell says she i m not going to give jamshyd up to them dames until i have a showdown she drained another cup then walked down the hall to where jamshyd was sleeping she gave him a playful pinch on the arm he woke up and looked

you have to put faith in the yarn about noah however because much subsequent history is tinged by it the centuries old patriarch when he tripped down the gangplank of the ark found the water polluted water water everywhere but not a drop to drink he refused to quench his thirst with the element in which so many humans and other animals had drowned and decayed he knew something about hygiene did noah so he planted himself a vineyard and waited every viticulturist knows it takes from three to four years to get a crop from a new vineyard but noah waited and oh what athirst he built up finally the day arrived he drank his fill and full was he he went to sleep at the foot of a tree in a state of nudity his three sons came and took a look at him shem and japheth covered him with their mantles ham stood by and laughed when noah woke up he made inquiries and he changed ham into a black man millenia afterwards this act resulted in a great civil war in america followed by a dispute between italy and ethiopia who can foretell the trouble yet to come? the black man feels more poignant pain and pleasure than any other of noah s descendants doubtless because his black skin

one of the famous stories of wine concerns the origin of the noted italian brand est est although it involves the death of a bishop of the church the anecdote is amusing the bishop a german named defoucris set out on a pilgrimage to rome he was fond of good wine and to make sure on this point he sent his trusted valet ahead of him by a day s post with instructions that he should taste the wine at every place where he stopped and write under the bush the evergreen branch which the tavern keeper puts above his door the word est it is if it was tolerable and est est it is it is if it was very good but when he found it indifferent he should not write up anything defoucris valet arrived at monte fiascone and approved so much of the wine that he wrote up est est the bishop found the wine so palatable that he got drunk the next day he got drunk again and the day after and the days following he got drunk and drunk and drunk ad infinitum finally he died 0 acute alcoholism as they say at bellevue hospital new york and he never saw the pope at all small matter that for he passed to immortality both above and below they buried him gave the wine the talismanic name est est and erected a monument which to this day bears the epitaph which his efficient valet wrote

george washington made wine from the scuppernong grape at mount vernon and sold it andrew jackson although he preferred fiery spirits kept his mnage stocked with choice wines but henry clay seems to have been the best friend of the grape in the early years of the nineteenth century when william robert prince proprietor of the linnean botanic garden of long island new york wrote in 1830 a treatise on the vine the first great book on american viticulture he dedicated it to henry clay 
 to henry clay of kentucky sir it is with sentiments of gratification and pride that i inscribe this work to one who through life has been the undeviating patron of american industry whose name is interwoven with the various objects connected with the development of our national resources and whose unwearied efforts have been devoted to imparting that impulse too our domestic pursuits which is best calculated to advance the high destinies of our republic the knowledge of these interesting facts carry the conviction with them of the peculiar appropriateness of the present dedication but sir the additional circumstance that you more than thirty years ago united with many of our fellow citizens in forming an association for promoting the cultivation of the vine in our country

thomas jefferson was a champion of wine as a moralist as a patriot and as one deeply interested in the health and vigor of the american people writing from monticello on december 18 1818 to m de neville he said 
 i rejoice as a moralist at the prospect of a reduction of the duties on wine by our national legislature it is an error to view a tax on that liquor as merely a tax on the rich it is a prohibition of its use to the middling class of our citizens and a condemnation of them to the poison of whisky which is desolating their houses no nation is drunken where wine is cheap and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage it is in truth the only antidote to the bane of whisky fix but the duty at the rate of other merchandise and we can drink wine here as cheap

the history of wine making in america reads like a romance whose hero is discovery leading from darkness into light the juice of the grape 
the first man to discover the wine making qualities of the native american grape was tyrker the german foster father of lief ericson who accompanied him on his famous voyage of 1 000 a d tyrker whom lief greatly loved got separated from his fellows and was missing for a long time when he returned lief received him most joyously according to an old icelandic manuscript entitled the finding of wineland the good tyrker was in lively spirits he was most supremely happy at first he talked rapidly in german and rolled his eyes then he began to speak the northern tongue he had found vines and grapes such as grew in his native germany whereupon lief called the country wineland and he took on board a cargo of grapes one can feel sure that a part of the cargo was in liquid form and that old tyrker was the first wine maker who ever practiced the art in the united states 
 but that was a mere incident hidden for hundreds of years in a scandinavian manuscript the romance of wine in america begins with tragedy made poignant by the blindness and stubbornness of its

finally came john adlum who urged the cultivation of the alexander grape and who disseminated the na tive catawba of which long fellow sang and which was the first superlative american wine grape and who at the stipulation of thomas jefferson published in 1823 cultivation of the vine the first american book on american grapes to quote dr hedrick seven years afterwards the naturalist and great nurseryman william robert prince published his immortal treatise on the vine which marked as notable a victory for native vines as the battle of yorktown did for political america he listed about seventy varieties of indigenous grapes and freed america from the worship of its european vine fetish 
the seventy five years following prince showed marvelous progress in the development of native wine varieties hybridization was practiced notably by e s rogers whereby the best qualities of europe s grapes were mingled with immunized american varieties

hundreds on hundreds of european varieties have been imported to california where with european practice as regards phylloxera and fungi the 
old world grape can be grown perfectly of all these thousands only a few hundred have survived as desirable either for the table or for wine so that the wine maker is concerned with but a few this book has to do with wine varieties alone and for convenience the author has divided america into four divisions the east the south california and similar pacific coast terrain and canada the varieties mentioned are not quite those that would have been included in a volume written before prohibition the sumptuary inhibitions of this iniquitous law put viticulturists and scientists on edge more study was given to the making of wine and the production of fine wine grapes in this baneful epoch than is realized and as a result america is now ready to compete with the world this is the first book so far as the author knows to bring forward america s newest raw material for wine

 thomas moore ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the east catawba this grape is mentioned first because it is the first great native white wine grape discovered wild probably about 1801 it was disseminated far and wide by the pioneer john adlum about 1823 was used by nicholas longworth in the early years of the last century for the production of white wine at cincinnati and is still the basis for the finest of white wines and of champagne in the famous finger lakes region of new york its color is a brilliant red but the skins contain no dissolvable pigment in early stages of fermentation the wine is slightly pinkish but after a year it becomes a glorious golden color favorably grown its juice will contain from 20 to 23 per cent of sugar iona this is mentioned second because many hold it to be the most perfect of american wine grapes it originated in 1885 and dr hedrick thinks it contains blood of both the labrusca native american and of vinifera european delicious to the taste it develops in fermentation an aroma like that of arabian balm balm in gilead which fills a room with its fragrance emanating from the glass slowly so that he who drinks it is prone not to swallow but to smell as he nurses it along like the catawba it is red in color but produces a golden wine its juice under the most favorable condition with enough units of sunshine will test from 21 to 26 per cent of sugar delaware difficult to grow in some locations

adam champ agne this is america s grape of romance alva adam farmer of hammonton new jersey was hunting sixty years ago and found a grape in the south jersey swamps which was so good to eat that he marked the tree upon which it grew and the following spring transplanted the vine to his garden decade after decade he grew it and enjoyed eating it when prohibition came he made cuttings and planted a vineyard the wine losing the musky taste of the ripe grape developed a flavor identical with that of champagne its culture has spread in new jersey delaware maryland and pennsylvania it will not ripen perfectly north of these states its skin is amber and the wine at a year old assumes a beautiful golden color it will probably rank as the most productive white wine grape of the middle atlantic states 
 the above grapes are in a class by themselves also used in the production of white wines in the east and by the east is included the states of the so called middle west embracing missouri and illinois are the following which also do well in the south they produce white not golden wines very much resembling rhenish

missouri reisling produced in missouri in 1870 it ranks with the above varieties as a wine producer 
noah introduced in 1869 at nauvoo illinois this grape is similar to the above it is good for the middle north or the south 
 also in a class by itself stands the following variety 
ontario this is the best white wine grape originated by the new york experiment station to the taste it is nectar being a hybrid of the native labrusca and europe s vinifera its vine is vigorous its american blood frees it from disease the ripe berry is green tinged with gold where the sun kisses it in favorable years it will develop 25 per cent of sugar and its wine is a greenish silver like that of chablis but even better than this famed french product maturing early its vintage comes in the last week of august or the first week of september which means that the wine maker s vats can be clear of it before other sorts claim them 
 all the above are white wine varieties but white wine can be made of red grapes crush them press them quickly before fermentation has a

chance to dissolve the pigment in the skins and the result will be white wine deficient in tannin but very good for blending with real white wine* * * now for red wines they are of two kinds the pale red wines and the deep colored sorts that are used mainly to enhance the color and body of other wines one third part of cynthjana clevener or diogenes can make a red wine out of a white wine manufactured from any of the varieties mentioned above 
cynthiana or norton it is disputed whether these are two varieties o r one botanical characteristics are the same the wine is indistinguishable but the fact remains that cynthiana ripens two weeks ahead of norton which makes it more desirable in new jersey pennsylvania and new york the wine slightly wild in taste when added to the wine made of sheridan or eumelan produces something that ranks with bur gundy or bordeaux and maybe better 
clevener this began to be raised in the vicinity of egg harbor city new jersey about 1870 like cynthiana and norton it produces a wine so deep in color you can scarcely see through a glass when blended with light red wines the result is a product not much less in quality than when cynthiana is used 
diogenes or ironclad this old variety which botanists declare to be the hardiest of all american

ives this makes a very deep red wine but not so deep as the above varieties discovered in 1840 by henry ives near cincinnati it was used by nicholas longworth at cincinnati in the manufacture of port when mingled half and half with the lighter red wines it produces something that is almost indistinguishable from the claret of bordeaux and maybe better 
clinton this grape makes a wine of a slightly deeper color than ives but not of so high quality alone it tastes damnably but when blended not more than 20 per cent with light red wines it helps to produce a wine of claret quality 
 the above varieties produce coloring agents but 
there is still another which is now in the process of 
introduction 

westfield this is the newest production of the new york state experiment station and is likely with ontario and sheridan to survive as the greatest achievement of dr hedrick at geneva and of dr gladwin at fredonia there are perhaps only 300 plants in existence of which the author through the courtesy of dr hedrick and dr gladwin has about 100 for experimental purposes the cynthiana norton the clevener the ironclad the ives and the clinton impart a wild

 the grapes which produce light red wine come next 
sheridan the author is not certain whether this will rank as the first of eastern american wine grapes or whether that place will be shared by ontario silvery white or westfield deep red disseminated by dr hedrick in 1920 as a grape to take the place of concord it has proved to be more productive than concord and to have better growing characteristics concord never will test more than from 13 to 16 per cent of sugar sheridan will go to 22 or 23 its wine is perfect except for color when one fourth part of cynthiana norton clevener or diogenes is added its color is rectified becoming a beautiful ruby the main point however is its flavor and aroma it emanates the essence of the raspberry as does burgundy and when mingled with the pure wine of the westfield which contains no wildness it is likely to produce a wine that will surpass anything that france can send across the atlantic

eumelan aside from sheridan perhaps the best light red wine in america comes from the eumelan grape it isn t liked by vineyardists because it cannot pollinate itself and because it cannot be grown from cuttings and must be reproduced by layering

beacon this grape produced by munson in 1886 and adapted to both south and north is given first place on the authority of dr f e gladwin of the new york state grape laboratory at fredonia who has conducted experiments in florida the skin is black and the juice is aromatic and spicy it has sufficient tannin in the skins and enough tartaric acid to preserve it from wine diseases and its must possesses from 18 to 20 per cent of sugar the author has tasted its wine which is of the claret type full bodied and fragrant the use of this grape will help the south to build up a great wine industry

lomanto perfect in acid content this grape producing a claret type wine is good either for the gulf states or for the north for further description see canada 
fern munson this is the south s catawba flavored grape but its wine is deep red munson originated it in 1893 there is plenty of tannin and tartaric acid 
america this is one of munson s best wine grapes introduced in 1885 it resists the heat of the south and the cold of the north its wine is intensely red the sugar content of the must is very high and if raised to 28 per cent after using the saccharometer it can be aged into a very good natural port containing 16 per cent of alcohol without fortifying with brandy

california 
 california when it comes to wines is america but still not america california with other sections of the southwest is the only portion of the united states where european grapes vitis vinifera can be grown and these varieties prevail there almost exclusively climatically different from the east the south the north and canada its grapes differ absolutely and its methods of wine making vary by far from those of the other sections its own oenologists can direct the wine maker better than an author from the east t he californian therefore is referred to a

mission this variety is mentioned first because it is the historic grape of california brought there by the earliest fathers of the church probably by junipero sera himself it is pure european but nobody knows what it was called in the old world once says bioletti it was the only grape for white or red wine dry or sweet or for eating grown in california its berries are black carrying pigment red wine is made by fermenting fully on the skins white wine by pressing it as soon as crushed better sorts are taking its place except for the manufacture of sherry it has gained immortality from the fact that it has produced from a plant set at carpinteria california by a spanish woman in 1842 the largest grape vine in the world the trunk of this viticultural giant is eight feet in cir cumference its branches cover half an acre and it produced in 1895 according to the u s agricultural yearbook of 1907 more than ten tons of grapes

dr palmer has been giving scientific attention to wine problems frost comes no later in ontario influenced by the propinquity of the great lakes than it does in new york or on the north bank of the rhine the real trouble comes from the short days of september and october which do not provide enough sunshine to convert the starch in the leaves into sugar for the grapes a listing of canadian wine grapes present and prospective follows 
concord ripening perfectly but of low sugar content unless a pound or a pound and a half of cane sugar be added to the must the wine is so deficient in alcohol 7 or 8 per cent that the product is susceptible afterward despite all ordinary precautions to vinegar fermentation if raised in sugar content a fair red wine can be made by blending with other grapes however the addition of cane sugar may impart a slightly bitter taste to the product see chapter on wine making 
niagara this grape will ripen but it has no more sugar than concord and its wine has a flavor that reminds one of the taste of listerine

implements 
carpenter can not work without tools n either can a man make wine satisfactorily without utensils these may vary from the simplest sort of outfit to the amazing power presses and combined crushers  stemmers pressers of 
the big wineries this book does not concern the latter it is primarily for the small wine maker and if he in the course of years graduates into a big wine maker he must perforce call in the services of an expert such as the winery implement houses stand ready to provide for him below is a list of the appliances which the home wine maker and the small winery require some of them are indispensable for the former and all of them for the latter 
cellar this very strictly is not an implement but a location but it comes first and no man should try to produce wine without a cellar to provide a low and even temperature this subject will be treated at length in the chapter headed cellar and bottle

regular fermenting vats made of oak or redwood whose tops are considerably smaller than their bottoms and which can be obtained from barrel factories in all three cases heavy muslin cloths should be provided which can be closely fastened with sections of clothes line so as to hold in the vat a part of the carbon dioxide arising from fermentation all vats should be placed on heavy wooden frames or platforms 18 inches high so as to facilitate the siphoning or drawing off of the wine when the first fermentation is complete as indicated by 
the sinking of the skins siphon wells these can be constructed of large mesh wire one fourth inch heavily galvanized they are made round five or six inches in diameter and the joining can be done with fine copper wire they should be just high enough to reach beyond the top of the vat they should be covered with a single layer of cheesecloth sewed to the frame and to the bottom 
siphons these are made of rubber tubing of one half inch inside measurement and of a length sufficient to reach from the bottom of the well over the top of the vat and to a vessel on the floor they should be tied in two or three places to a piece of heavy straight wire galvanized or copper the latter preferred long enough to reach from the bottom of the well to six 
 56 who drinks more shall drink less zipoli ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ inches above the top of the vat the tube must not go to the end of the wire and in operation the tube can be made to slide upward so as to avoid clogging with the murk that is likely to gather at the bottom of the well and which must be thrown out every so often 
crusher this consists of a wooden hopper at the bottom of which are two rollers of non corroding metal or rubber which on operation of the crank revolve in opposite directions these rollers can be adjusted so that the grapes passing between them will be thoroughly crushed without any seed being broken there are arms at the bottom of the crusher which enable it to be securely placed across the top of the vat a crusher can be bought at almost every hardware store at a modest price don t get a little toy one 
press this standard implement upright and operated by hand may be bought cheaply enough at hardware stores or winery supply houses it were best not to purchase a tiny affair but a good and heavy one the more ambitious may obtain for more money pressers operated by electrical power or centrifugal pressers which look like torpedoes the smaller of which may be operated by hand the larger by power

wine making 
heoretically the making of wine is as easy as rolling off a log to borrow a pioneer expression wine is the fermented juice of grapes crush your grapes let them ferment and you have wine but try it at every stage in the making of wine an 
enemy lurks beside the real wine yeasts saccharomyces ellipsoideus of many benevolent varieties which actually create wine by transforming the sugar in your must into about 52 per cent potable alcohol 2 per cent glycerine which is a higher alcohol and 44 per cent carbonic dioxide gas which goes up in the air the other 2 per cent nourishing the yeast there are malignant yeasts and bacilli which tend to undo your work and ruin your product 
 somebody wrote many decades ago that sugar divided itself in fermentation into 50 per cent alcohol and 50 per cent carbonic gas this fallacy like many other fallacies in grape culture and wine making has been repeated by subsequent writers there are scores of such mistakes they will persist as long as writers write from other writers books instead of experience 
 61 
wine that maketh glad the heart of man psalms ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the bad yeasts are called by the scientists saccharomyces apiculatus mycoderma vini of many strains torula yeasts saccharomyces anomalus saccharomyces ludwigii saccharomyces cerevisaie beer yeast saccharomyces pasteurianus now don t be scared when fermentation starts it is estimated that there are 1 000 000 cells of malevolent yeast to every single cell of real wine yeast however cheer up the one good cell kills off the 1 000 000 in a short while when proper management is practiced the true wine yeast cells multiply marvelously fast and in two or three days when fermentation is active there are 6 000 000 000 of their cells in a fluid ounce of the juice the problem is to produce such conditions that the true yeast will quickly raise the alcoholic content to 10 per cent then the battle is won if proper subsequent management is employed then there are moulds that destroy wine like the pencillium glaucum or green mould which develops on broken grapes in unclean barrels and utensils next in contradistinction to yeasts and moulds which are vegetable organisms come bacilli which be long to the animal kingdom most to be feared is the vinegar bacteria but it can be controlled easily because it cannot exist without the presence of air and is quickly killed by sulphur no acetic acid vinegar can form in a cask which is kept bung full of wine and has been subjected before use to the burning of sulphur but if these precautions are not followed this bacteria can attack the alcohol in your wine it is a toper and wants 
 62 
never did a great man hate good wine rabelais ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ nothing else and transform it into vinegar in this connection it may be noted that if the sugar content of must is raised to 26 per cent thereby producing a wine with 14 per cent alcohol neither the vinegar bacteria nor any other disease can do much to harm your wine even under medium adverse conditions other bacteria deleterious to wine are the tourne organism which produces a mousy odor and taste it is dangerous be cause unlike the vinegar bacteria it grows in the absence of air which gives little trouble in dry wines containing no sugar mannite bacteria and the bacteria which produces slimy wines 
now sit up and listen wine maker the foregoing paragraphs sound discouraging but they need not alarm you heed this cleanliness is your salvation keep your cellar and your fermenting room scrupulously clean use whitewash and disinfectants sulphur your barrels and your fermenting vats immerse your bungs in boiling water every cloth every utensil scald with boiling water every time before you use it pour boiling water through your siphons every two weeks fill vessels with sulphur and disinfect your cellar be clean be prophylactic and you never will lose an ounce of wine this advice is based on experience the author out of hatred of the sumptuary laws of his country be gan making wine fifteen years ago he planted an experimental vineyard and he consulted experts and he never has lost either from wild yeasts moulds or bacteria a cubic centimeter of wine

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ by the addition of cane sugar which in 48 hours mixed with the grape becomes grape sugar but if no sugar is used in the case of grapes which normally are deficient in that element or which in bad seasons are deficient so that only 13 to 15 per cent of sugar is present the wine maker will have a highly acid wine of 7 to 8 per cent alcohol nobody on earth can keep such a wine from spoiling except by pasteurization whic h impairs the quality when a variety of wine grape yields a sugar content of 22 to 24 per cent it is best to leave it alone when it is lower in sugar its content must be raised to 25 or 26 per cent which will yield a wine of 14 per cent alcohol by volume this is done as follows estimate the amount of juice you have exclusive of skins and seeds grapes differ greatly in proportions measure your sugar content by means of the saccharometer then heighten it to 25 or 26 per cent by the addition of cane sugar on the basis that one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will raise the content 9 per cent thus if you have must that has 17 per cent of sugar the addition of one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will give you a must of 26 per cent sugar producing a wine of 14 per cent alcohol 
some writers advise the amelioration of super acid wine must with water the addition of water tends to destroy the quality of any wine and the method never should be employed except when a bad season has caused the must when tested by the acidimeter to show more than 1 per cent of acid in such a case one gallon of

the normal eastern wine grape varies from 4 per cent to 8 per cent in acid content instead of adding sugared water a process which is called gallizing after dr gall a german scientist it would be better to blend at the completion of fermentation wines having too much acid with those having too little an alternative would be the keeping of the wines in casks for a number of years as the french do during which time the superfluous tartaric acid would be cast down to the botto m in the shape of crystals making the aged wine mellow and perfect can americans have the patience for this? they ought to have

having praised wine told its history described grapes that act as the tcraw material listed the needed imple ments and presented certain sanitary and ameliorating principles the next thing is to proceed to actual methods 
wandering along according to his own whim the author is going to divide processes into three categories first the traditional method which originated in ancient times and reached its perfection before pasteur came on the scene second the advanced method 
 65 
they eat and drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy milton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ which takes in on a simplified scale some of pasteur s discoveries and third the modern method of the latter very little will be said because it belongs to the big wineries and the experts at this point however the author wants to give the reader a vision of the future pasteur believed that alcohol was produced in vinous fermentation by the action of the living yeast cells on the sugar in the must if i am asked he said in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed and what is its real cause i reply that i am completely ignorant of it the scientist buchner disposed of pasteur s puzzlement just a few years ago he showed that fermentation was not the result of the growth of the living yeast cell but that it resulted from a secretion an infinitely small exudation of the yeast cell he called the secretion zymase now who knows that the scientists of the future will not be able to extract this zymase from the yeast and afterwards to create it synthetically so that the wine maker of the future will be able to pasteurize or defecate his juice by means of meta bisulphite and by adding the proper zymase ferment the most perfect wines the world has ever known a vision but who in the days of abraham lincoln could have dreamed of tele vision? always there are enough of the true yeast cells on the skins of grapes to start fermentation they hibernate in the ground and are blown onto the grapes by the wind when they begin their work in the wine must

scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendant vintage as it grows gray 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ subsisting on sugar they immediately begin multiplication by means of buds which dropping off become new cells the rate of propagation is astonishing and as has been said in two or three days after normal fermentation begins as many as 6 000 000 000 of them exist in an ounce of must 
the management in fermentation differs in the making of red wine and white wine but since the manufacture of the former employs most of the principles used with the latter it will be considered first 
red wine 
traditional method be sure first as a preliminary that your fermenting cellar is absolutely clean its walls should be whitewashed adding a cup of dissolved salt or alum to every two gallons of the mixture purify the floor by disinfecting with chlorine or some reliable odor less commercial preparation let there be no vegetables fruits green wood or rubbish in your cellar last of all bum a few plates of sulphur in it after closing all apertures 
let every vat be scalded outside and inside with boiling water the big wineries use steam turn the vats upside down and burn just a little sulphur under each scald every portion of your crusher and your press with boiling water and do the same with every other utensil 
you are now ready to proceed with the vintage 
 67 
but still the vine her ancient ruby yields and still a garden by the water blows 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
grapes for red wine should be allowed to reach full ripeness but 
not become over ripe they should be harvested in bright weather 
and not before all the dew on them has evaporated the berries must 
be separated from the stems from all green grapes and from grapes 
that are rotten in any degree whatsoever or have their skins broken 
for such grapes harbor the deleterious wild yeasts and bacteria the 
manner of separation may be in two ways for the small wine 
producer 1 by hand 2 by picking each bad grape out of each 
bunch then pulling the bunch across a board from one to two inches 
thick through which long nails have been driven in rows so that the 
sharp ends stand up an inch and a half the board being carved with 
run ways through which juice may flow into the pan bucket or jar 
which you are using these operations can be performed in the open 
air on a porch or under a shed by women and children the big 
wineries of course have stemming machines but they cannot 
escape if they are conscientious the laborious task of removing the 
bad grapes 
now carry the grapes to the fermenting cellar and put them through the crusher into the vat fill the vat only three fourths full for if you fill higher the expanding mass will spillover the top tie tightly with a section of clothesline heavy muslin covers over the vats twice a day thereafter remove the muslin and stir the must so that the skins floating on top will be thoroughly mixed with all the juice temperature of

 the rubaiyat fourth edition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
fermenting room should be between 60 and 75 degrees fermentation raises the heat of the must and if it goes over 90 degrees the wine yeast begins to die and at 100 degrees fahrenheit it is killed absolutely the vat fermentation of red wines will last from 5 to 10 days the former at a cellar temperature of 75 degrees the latter at 60 degrees you will know when it is complete because the ticking sound will almost cease and the murk on top will begin to sink into the wine 
the first fermentation done the next two steps are siphoning off and pressing put the wells to the very bottom of the vats insert the rubber siphons have your buckets ready suck on the lower end of the tube until you get wine in your mouth then let the juice flow into the bucket spit the juice out for it wouldn t be good for you if you swallowed it remember what new wine did to noah carry the new wine into your wine cellar and pour it through a funnel into the barrel where the secondary or slow fermentation is to take place fill within three or four inches of the top then adjust your water seal before long the tup tup tup of the gas escaping through the water will make most delightful music for your ears 
at first the vat wine will flow furiously through the siphoning tube but suddenly will come a gurp and the flow will cease wait a few minutes for the well to fill again this may be expedited by lifting out the well and scraping the slimy murk off the cheesecloth covering siphon once more until there is another 
 69 
truth itself doth flow in wine samuel johnson ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ gurp and keep the process going until no more juice gathers in the well try different sides of the vat 
then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale 
this siphoned wine will be your best wine 
 next comes pressing which yields another quality the murk seeds and skins is removed into the drum of the press and the rest of the juice is extracted put a piece of strong but not too closely woven cloth previously boiled in the drum monks cloth from any department store is preferable then pour in enough of the murk to bring the height to four or six inches fold the cloth over the top of the murk put in another section of cloth and fill it in the same manner then other sections until the drum is nearly full apply pressure until no more juice runs then remove all the sections except the bottom one and place them temporarily in a pan uncovering the bottom layer of murk at its top stir it until it is loose put the other layers in and do the same thing then resume pressing repeat the loosening of the murk and the pressing until the residue is quite dry then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale

 percent more alcohol than the siphoned wine it is harsher of taste containing more tannin and tartaric acid some mix it immediately with the siphoned wine but it were best to let it mature in separate casks and use it for blending afterward never does disease occur in pressed wine when correctly managed because of its high alcoholic content and its excess of tannin and tartaric 
advanced method this is where pasteur and his discoveries come in about three days before the red grapes are to be fermented take some of the ripest a gallon or more according to the size of the main fermentation put them in a small vat in a room of 70 degrees to 75 degrees temperature the temperature is imperative and in three days they will contain a maximum of wine yeast cells perhaps 6 000 000 000 to the ounce of juice when the main manufacture begins stir thoroughly into your vats a gallon of this must to every 30 gallons of new must the prepared yeast will work so quickly that no wild yeast will have a chance 
modern method science has full play in this and it is used mainly by the big wineries it consists of the employment of wine yeast cultures to start the fermentation big wineries having laboratories segregate pure yeast that has produced superior wine commercial laboratories supply many forms of pure yeast even the kinds that make the best wines in europe state experiment stations are working on it and at geneva new york 90 kinds of pure yeasts are in experimentation governments in this can aid wine makers

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
grape must requires special treatment before it is impregnated with these cultured yeasts every native yeast benevolent or malevolent and all bacteria must first be killed this can be done by pasteurization the raising of the temperature to 140 degrees but this is prone to destroy certain desirable qualities the favorite method is sterilization by means of potassium metabisulfite when the cultured yeast finally is added there is no competition 
the modern method is not within the scope of this book and the 
above is written mainly to stir the imagination of the reader the 
graduate of small wine manufacture into big wine making will on 
request be referred to authorities who can tell him all he wants to 
know about these ultra modern methods 
white wine 
it is a fetish long abiding that white wine has to be made from fresh juice pressed from grapes as soon as they are crushed but let the small wine maker without a power press try it if he use all his muscle on the press he can hardly extract a worth while amount of juice from grapes that have not been softened by the first stages of fermentation 
however if white wine is to be made from grapes having dissolvable red pigment in them it is obligatory that as much of the white juice as possible be extracted as soon as they are crushed what is left over can be put through the regular red wine fermentation 
 72 
drink and smile and learn to think that we were born to smile and drink 
 anacreon moore 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
certain grapes of a pink or amber hue have no dissolvable color in the skins such as catawba iona delaware and adam champagne and despite externals cannot be classed with red wine grapes they can be considered in the same category as the grapes which when ripe are green or golden green such as the ontario the elvira etc 
white wine can be made from these grapes when they are put to full fermentation on the skin and in this case the procedure is exactly that in the case of red wine such wine is full bodied astringent because of its tannin and wholesomely acid because of its tartaric it cannot spoil except under bad management 
the full process of white wine making is precisely that of the red process differing not in the slightest degree there are two other traditional processes suitable for the small wine maker 
first traditional method let the grapes after being crushed ferment in vats for a day or two until the pulp is soft then 1 siphon and 2 press the residue may be allowed to continue its fermentation in vats and there will result a very alcoholic heavy and highly flavored wine which managed precisely as red wine may delight the heart 
second traditional method by muscle and dexterity extract in the press as much of the juice as you can as soon as the grapes are pressed ferment the residue and there will be lots of it precisely as you would for red wine the product of this residue will be 
 73 
we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart shakespeare 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
several points better than the product mentioned in the paragraph 
above 
after treatment of both traditional methods the juice 
mentioned in both the preceding paragraphs should not be fermented 
in vats it should be transferred to barrels filled three fourths with 
water seals immediately inserted both the first furious fermentation 
and the later secondary slow fermentation can take place in the same 
barrels when the first fermentation is through the barrels should be 
filled to within three or four inches of the top from the contents of 
other barrels or demijohns and the second fermentation should 
proceed still under the water seals it is difficult to tell when the 
primary fermentation ends and the secondary begins so it is best to 
fill the barrels when the bubbling of the water seals becomes slow 
advanced method this is exactly the same as for red wine except that under the first traditional method for white wine the whole starter skins and pulp should be added to the grapes as soon as crushed whereas in the second traditional method only the juice from the starter should be added to the freshly pressed juice of the grape see red wine paragraph entitled advanced method 
modern method this is applicable only to freshly pressed juice defecated by means of potassium metabisulfite and filtered pure yeast culture is then added only big wineries can do it 
this ends the instructions on primary processes but you are not done yet wine maker wait until you step into your wine cellar

in it you succeed or fail in 
transmuting your raw material 
into as perfect a product as 
possible 
if you have followed the directions of the last chapter you have a fine chance of success but if you ignore good wine practice in your cellar you will fail 
now this cellar should be separate from your fermenting room and always dark it should be whitewashed and made sanitary exactly as your fermenting room was keep everything out of it except your wine and your appliances no vegetable no fruit no rubbish if you have a cellar under your residence you can partition it off part for your fermenting room part for the true wine cellar if you have a steep hillside and some money you can drive straight in with a stemming room outside under a shed a fermenting room a little further in partly covered with earth and a real cellar still further this arrangement will constitute a small winery ready for licensing by the united states government but before you go that far learn by your own experience how to make good and salable wine

machines with less injury to the bouquet and flavor of the wine racking consists of siphoning the wine off the lees into another cask two or three rackings are usually sufficient these should be made in bright weather 
don t buy cheap bottles and don t buy cheap corks when it comes to bottling choose a bright sunshiny day put your corks in water brought to a boil to soften them but do not boil them if you have strong fingers you can insert the corks until their tops reach just below the tops of the bottles however a corking machine is desirable and quite cheap 
when your wine thoroughly matured in the oak is bottled then comes bottle management they are laid on their sides in tiers so that the corks are always in contact with the wine in the barrels your wine will have been ameliorated because crystals of tartaric acid will have been thrown down to the bottom in bottles there will be no more of this but something infinitely more important will occur the acids working on the alcohol will produce in the bottles what scientific men call esters or ethers the most important one being the oenanthic ester wine aroma in five or six years american wine in the bottle should reach its acme of excellence

only one the author cares about wants to pull off a state party 
having for his guests the marchioness quiff quaff the duke of 
down down herr hitler signor mussolini the prince of wales 
stalin and the emperor of japan it were best that he call in a caterer 
who will provide the proper glasses the proper wines and the proper 
food he can get all this for 2 000 or 3 000 perhaps glasses? the idea that their shape has anything to do with the enjoyment of wine is simply bunk and no american citizen with any ability to think should give the matter his attention such things belong only to the imaginations of the aesthetes what does amount to something however is the color 0 f the glass wine should never be poured into a glass of any other color than pure crystal which means no color at all talleyrand in his historic dictum has told us to look at the wine first and enjoy its color to lift it to the nostril and enjoy the bouquet then to convey it to the mouth and enjoy the taste through the crystal glass you can

the first dukes of burgundy established vineyards on their own account and we learn from their ancient ordinances how much theyprided themselves on the possession of the finest wine countries in christendom and the duke of burgundy was often designated by the title of prince of good wines william robert prince 1830 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ enjoy the color whether it be red as the ruby have the sparkle of the garnet present the precious yellow of gold the pure white of rhenish or the greenish silver of the wine made from the ontario grape 
the aesthetes are right on one point a heavy wine with much aroma should be served in a large glass filled half way twirl such a glass and you will get all the bouquet 
to debunk the wine glass is one thing to debunk the idea of the connoisseur writer that wine in america should be served with meals and not otherwise is another yet it ought not to be difficult 
the great mass of americans have always drunk wine as a between meals beverage an intoxicant if you like they care not at all for it as a fluid to wash down foods as do the french and the italians for an hour or two before dinner the american will want to drink wine but when wine is set before him at dinner he will take very little of it the author of this book has tried it out at his home on college professors newspaper editors publishers scientists authors of best sellers and many others they wanted their wine before not dur ing the meal white wine with fish? the glasses were untouched red wine with chicken or beef? the chicken or beef was eaten but the wine was not drunk 
this advice to the american who makes his own wine and consumes it let your taste be your guide if you

if grapes were in colonial new england or wine was made from theforeign grape no great degree of success was attained wine was mad~in plenty from the wild grapes in all of the new england colonies so thatit was not because of puritanical prejudices against wine that thei vine was not grown dr u p hedrick 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ can t enjoy wine and if you can t enjoy wine surely you can t drink beer with your meals call it off eat your fill and take your customary coffee but if you have been drinking wine before the meal take no milk when wine or milk are mixed all the laws of chemistry smack at you before the meal drink all you ought to have of wine put your best wine before your guests and give them all they ought to have but no more be a considerate host in spite of the french arid the italians never mind the meal when people are hungry they are not thirsty transmogrify yourself all you like if you are american and anglo saxon you cannot escape racial facts 
neither the national government nor the state governments have ever taken the question of aiding the wine maker very much to heart the entrenched whisky and gin interests by means of independent propaganda have since repeal easily swung the nation into a hard liquor country the manufacturers of beer have had their say yet the united states has no nook or portion which will not produce wine and the united states is almost as big as all europe combined 3 738 393 square miles as compared with europe s 3 776 700 the isothermal line that cuts the great northern portion of europe off from wine production does not touch the united states though it excludes half of europe in the whole of its vast terrain there 
 85 
in france alone the vine culture gives employment to two millions oflaborers without enumerating many subordinate mechanical branchesthat are benefited by it and it is attended with immense nationaladvantages these circumstances call upon our national government to pursue the course long since adopted by france 
 william robert prince american botanist 1830 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ is no wine isothermal it can be the world s greatest wine zone 
anglo saxons are a race subject to extremes they have their cycles of reform and perdition in one decade they are knocking at the doors of hell in the next they are beseeching st peter for forgiveness at the gates of heaven they won t stay put but they drink even when they stand before the pearly gates they either have or wish they had hip flasks it would be a great thing if they could be taught that the proper consumption of pure dry wines would cause them to confront st peter with better livers and better kidneys and may hap better consciences 
if america in the course of years can be made a wine drinking country it would greatly advantage the people and moreover it would forever make impossible the return of the ogre prohibition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ now comes the most important paragraph in this book take it to heart wine maker take it to heart having made your wine consume it with food or without as suits your whim if you want to drink it at dinner let your taste be your guide in spite of savarin or anybody else but this author knows you will drink it nine cases out of ten just by itself and between meals now then don t drink too much of it

this wine makers manual is dedicated to the 
government of the united states to all the state governments to the government of the dominion of canada and to the oenological experts of the province of ontario 
the american federal government at no time has done much of anything to help the wine maker either in the way of giving him technical guidance or in finding him foreign markets with two notable exceptions the state governments have done nothing california has taken the lead with marvelous scientific work new york has been of great aid by producing better varieties of wine grapes and has now begun scientific research in wine making included in which are experiments with more than ninety pure wine yeast cultures ontario has begun experimentation to provide better varieties of wine grapes 
with the exception of these two american states and one canadian province practically nothing has been done by constituted authority to help the wine maker the enormously big wineries do not need help except in the finding of foreign markets they have their own laboratories and experts the little ones do need guidance many a writer has said that the small wineries 
 5 
in europe and california produce a superior product governments should help them to reach perfection 
the neglect of the united states to help the wine maker is in sorry contrast with european practice the governments of france germany and italy especially provide scientific research instruction and foreign propaganda america can produce as good wine as any other nation on earth and vastly more of it the united states is one immense grape belt with no isothermal line limiting production 
 acknowledgment is hereby made of help extended to the author by dr u p hedrick director of the new york state agricultural experiment station at geneva by dr f e gladwin of the new york state grape laboratory at fredonia by dr e f palmer director of the experiment station at vineland ontario by h s stoll editor of wines & vines san francisco by the messrs champlin of the pleasant valley wine company rheims new york by the messrs widmer of the widmer winery naples new york and by t v munson & son of denison texas

to the time when good old uncle noah departing from the ark which he scuttled on mount ararat planted himself a vineyard and got terribly drunk on new wine which served him right because no prudent man would do such a thing however persia deserves especial consideration because of the picturesque story which she has passed down through the ages it concerns the warrior monarch jamshyd he was fond of grapes and grapes in persia grow as marvelously as melons they were brought to jamshyd and all the ladies of his harem in amphorae now the grape capacity of jamshyd and his thirty or forty wives varied sometimes a lot of grapes would accumulate in an amphora the juice would trickle to

now it so happened that plump little sweeta babi of all the ladies of the harem loved jamshyd the best she loved him so much that she suffered from perpetual jealousy now jealousy as all men know makes a woman most unattractive and jamshyd neglected her this made her despondent and spoiled her appetite so she could only nibble not eat the grapes the juice sank and fermented she felt so bad that she wanted to die and bethought herself of the poison that had accumulated at the bottom of her amphora she took a drinking vessel doubtless the kind from whic h the old persians drank their orange juice lifted the amphora in her shapely and beautiful arms and poured herself a bumper of life extinguisher she raised the cup she drained it to the last drop she threw herself on her harem couch and got ready to die she began to tingle and the tingle brought happiness life seemed so good but jamshyd s love or nothing nothing at all the throes of death failed to arrive so she filled the cup again and lay down to die again many more tingles much more happiness to hell says she i m not going to give jamshyd up to them dames until i have a showdown she drained another cup then walked down the hall to where jamshyd was sleeping she gave him a playful pinch on the arm he woke up and looked

one of the famous stories of wine concerns the origin of the noted italian brand est est although it involves the death of a bishop of the church the anecdote is amusing the bishop a german named defoucris set out on a pilgrimage to rome he was fond of good wine and to make sure on this point he sent his trusted valet ahead of him by a day s post with instructions that he should taste the wine at every place where he stopped and write under the bush the evergreen branch which the tavern keeper puts above his door the word est it is if it was tolerable and est est it is it is if it was very good but when he found it indifferent he should not write up anything defoucris valet arrived at monte fiascone and approved so much of the wine that he wrote up est est the bishop found the wine so palatable that he got drunk the next day he got drunk again and the day after and the days following he got drunk and drunk and drunk ad infinitum finally he died 0 acute alcoholism as they say at bellevue hospital new york and he never saw the pope at all small matter that for he passed to immortality both above and below they buried him gave the wine the talismanic name est est and erected a monument which to this day bears the epitaph which his efficient valet wrote

george washington made wine from the scuppernong grape at mount vernon and sold it andrew jackson although he preferred fiery spirits kept his mnage stocked with choice wines but henry clay seems to have been the best friend of the grape in the early years of the nineteenth century when william robert prince proprietor of the linnean botanic garden of long island new york wrote in 1830 a treatise on the vine the first great book on american viticulture he dedicated it to henry clay 
 to henry clay of kentucky sir it is with sentiments of gratification and pride that i inscribe this work to one who through life has been the undeviating patron of american industry whose name is interwoven with the various objects connected with the development of our national resources and whose unwearied efforts have been devoted to imparting that impulse too our domestic pursuits which is best calculated to advance the high destinies of our republic the knowledge of these interesting facts carry the conviction with them of the peculiar appropriateness of the present dedication but sir the additional circumstance that you more than thirty years ago united with many of our fellow citizens in forming an association for promoting the cultivation of the vine in our country

thomas jefferson was a champion of wine as a moralist as a patriot and as one deeply interested in the health and vigor of the american people writing from monticello on december 18 1818 to m de neville he said 
 i rejoice as a moralist at the prospect of a reduction of the duties on wine by our national legislature it is an error to view a tax on that liquor as merely a tax on the rich it is a prohibition of its use to the middling class of our citizens and a condemnation of them to the poison of whisky which is desolating their houses no nation is drunken where wine is cheap and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage it is in truth the only antidote to the bane of whisky fix but the duty at the rate of other merchandise and we can drink wine here as cheap

the history of wine making in america reads like a romance whose hero is discovery leading from darkness into light the juice of the grape 
the first man to discover the wine making qualities of the native american grape was tyrker the german foster father of lief ericson who accompanied him on his famous voyage of 1 000 a d tyrker whom lief greatly loved got separated from his fellows and was missing for a long time when he returned lief received him most joyously according to an old icelandic manuscript entitled the finding of wineland the good tyrker was in lively spirits he was most supremely happy at first he talked rapidly in german and rolled his eyes then he began to speak the northern tongue he had found vines and grapes such as grew in his native germany whereupon lief called the country wineland and he took on board a cargo of grapes one can feel sure that a part of the cargo was in liquid form and that old tyrker was the first wine maker who ever practiced the art in the united states 
 but that was a mere incident hidden for hundreds of years in a scandinavian manuscript the romance of wine in america begins with tragedy made poignant by the blindness and stubbornness of its

actors when the colonists made their settlements and saw the native wild grapes growing so luxuriantly in the woods they conceived the idea of bringing over the european grapes this they did with many varieties always the result was the same the vines grew for three or four years then withered and died the colonist would get a cask or two of wine discouraged he would quit someone else and there were frenchmen and swiss who tried it would plant more european vines and they would wither and die practically the only american wine that was made came from the juice of wild grapes picked in the forests it occurred to no one to domesticate these indigenous grapes give them cultivation and sunshine in open fields so as to improve their quality the palate of the colonist was used to the grapes of europe and he called the native grapes musty and foxy he wouldn t experiment with them the wild grapes grew in profusion so why wouldn t the european varieties? he couldn t know the reason darwin was as yet unborn and the science of entomology scarcely existed so how could he know that the soft roots of europe s vines were consumed by the tiny devouring worms of the phylloxera and that the leaves shoots and grapes were being sucked to death by minute parasitic plants called fungi? how could he know that the european grape had never before contended against these pests which were native american and that the american grapes in all their varieties had

finally came john adlum who urged the cultivation of the alexander grape and who disseminated the na tive catawba of which long fellow sang and which was the first superlative american wine grape and who at the stipulation of thomas jefferson published in 1823 cultivation of the vine the first american book on american grapes to quote dr hedrick seven years afterwards the naturalist and great nurseryman william robert prince published his immortal treatise on the vine which marked as notable a victory for native vines as the battle of yorktown did for political america he listed about seventy varieties of indigenous grapes and freed america from the worship of its european vine fetish 
the seventy five years following prince showed marvelous progress in the development of native wine varieties hybridization was practiced notably by e s rogers whereby the best qualities of europe s grapes were mingled with immunized american varieties

raw materials 

housands and thousands of varieties of american grapes have been developed and 
hundreds on hundreds of european varieties have been imported to california where with european practice as regards phylloxera and fungi the 
old world grape can be grown perfectly of all these thousands only a few hundred have survived as desirable either for the table or for wine so that the wine maker is concerned with but a few this book has to do with wine varieties alone and for convenience the author has divided america into four divisions the east the south california and similar pacific coast terrain and canada the varieties mentioned are not quite those that would have been included in a volume written before prohibition the sumptuary inhibitions of this iniquitous law put viticulturists and scientists on edge more study was given to the making of wine and the production of fine wine grapes in this baneful epoch than is realized and as a result america is now ready to compete with the world this is the first book so far as the author knows to bring forward america s newest raw material for wine

 thomas moore ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the east catawba this grape is mentioned first because it is the first great native white wine grape discovered wild probably about 1801 it was disseminated far and wide by the pioneer john adlum about 1823 was used by nicholas longworth in the early years of the last century for the production of white wine at cincinnati and is still the basis for the finest of white wines and of champagne in the famous finger lakes region of new york its color is a brilliant red but the skins contain no dissolvable pigment in early stages of fermentation the wine is slightly pinkish but after a year it becomes a glorious golden color favorably grown its juice will contain from 20 to 23 per cent of sugar iona this is mentioned second because many hold it to be the most perfect of american wine grapes it originated in 1885 and dr hedrick thinks it contains blood of both the labrusca native american and of vinifera european delicious to the taste it develops in fermentation an aroma like that of arabian balm balm in gilead which fills a room with its fragrance emanating from the glass slowly so that he who drinks it is prone not to swallow but to smell as he nurses it along like the catawba it is red in color but produces a golden wine its juice under the most favorable condition with enough units of sunshine will test from 21 to 26 per cent of sugar delaware difficult to grow in some locations

adam champ agne this is america s grape of romance alva adam farmer of hammonton new jersey was hunting sixty years ago and found a grape in the south jersey swamps which was so good to eat that he marked the tree upon which it grew and the following spring transplanted the vine to his garden decade after decade he grew it and enjoyed eating it when prohibition came he made cuttings and planted a vineyard the wine losing the musky taste of the ripe grape developed a flavor identical with that of champagne its culture has spread in new jersey delaware maryland and pennsylvania it will not ripen perfectly north of these states its skin is amber and the wine at a year old assumes a beautiful golden color it will probably rank as the most productive white wine grape of the middle atlantic states 
 the above grapes are in a class by themselves also used in the production of white wines in the east and by the east is included the states of the so called middle west embracing missouri and illinois are the following which also do well in the south they produce white not golden wines very much resembling rhenish

elvlra this productive grape is used for light colored white wine from new york to missouri and its product resembles that of the rhine it grows well in the south etta this variety introduced in missouri in 1879 is similar to elvira of which it is a seedling 
missouri reisling produced in missouri in 1870 it ranks with the above varieties as a wine producer 
noah introduced in 1869 at nauvoo illinois this grape is similar to the above it is good for the middle north or the south 
 also in a class by itself stands the following variety 
ontario this is the best white wine grape originated by the new york experiment station to the taste it is nectar being a hybrid of the native labrusca and europe s vinifera its vine is vigorous its american blood frees it from disease the ripe berry is green tinged with gold where the sun kisses it in favorable years it will develop 25 per cent of sugar and its wine is a greenish silver like that of chablis but even better than this famed french product maturing early its vintage comes in the last week of august or the first week of september which means that the wine maker s vats can be clear of it before other sorts claim them 
 all the above are white wine varieties but white wine can be made of red grapes crush them press them quickly before fermentation has a

chance to dissolve the pigment in the skins and the result will be white wine deficient in tannin but very good for blending with real white wine* * * now for red wines they are of two kinds the pale red wines and the deep colored sorts that are used mainly to enhance the color and body of other wines one third part of cynthjana clevener or diogenes can make a red wine out of a white wine manufactured from any of the varieties mentioned above 
cynthiana or norton it is disputed whether these are two varieties o r one botanical characteristics are the same the wine is indistinguishable but the fact remains that cynthiana ripens two weeks ahead of norton which makes it more desirable in new jersey pennsylvania and new york the wine slightly wild in taste when added to the wine made of sheridan or eumelan produces something that ranks with bur gundy or bordeaux and maybe better 
clevener this began to be raised in the vicinity of egg harbor city new jersey about 1870 like cynthiana and norton it produces a wine so deep in color you can scarcely see through a glass when blended with light red wines the result is a product not much less in quality than when cynthiana is used 
diogenes or ironclad this old variety which botanists declare to be the hardiest of all american

ives this makes a very deep red wine but not so deep as the above varieties discovered in 1840 by henry ives near cincinnati it was used by nicholas longworth at cincinnati in the manufacture of port when mingled half and half with the lighter red wines it produces something that is almost indistinguishable from the claret of bordeaux and maybe better 
clinton this grape makes a wine of a slightly deeper color than ives but not of so high quality alone it tastes damnably but when blended not more than 20 per cent with light red wines it helps to produce a wine of claret quality 
 the above varieties produce coloring agents but 
there is still another which is now in the process of 
introduction 

westfield this is the newest production of the new york state experiment station and is likely with ontario and sheridan to survive as the greatest achievement of dr hedrick at geneva and of dr gladwin at fredonia there are perhaps only 300 plants in existence of which the author through the courtesy of dr hedrick and dr gladwin has about 100 for experimental purposes the cynthiana norton the clevener the ironclad the ives and the clinton impart a wild

 the grapes which produce light red wine come next 
sheridan the author is not certain whether this will rank as the first of eastern american wine grapes or whether that place will be shared by ontario silvery white or westfield deep red disseminated by dr hedrick in 1920 as a grape to take the place of concord it has proved to be more productive than concord and to have better growing characteristics concord never will test more than from 13 to 16 per cent of sugar sheridan will go to 22 or 23 its wine is perfect except for color when one fourth part of cynthiana norton clevener or diogenes is added its color is rectified becoming a beautiful ruby the main point however is its flavor and aroma it emanates the essence of the raspberry as does burgundy and when mingled with the pure wine of the westfield which contains no wildness it is likely to produce a wine that will surpass anything that france can send across the atlantic

eumelan aside from sheridan perhaps the best light red wine in america comes from the eumelan grape it isn t liked by vineyardists because it cannot pollinate itself and because it cannot be grown from cuttings and must be reproduced by layering

scuppernong this name for a long time was synonymous with all other grapes of the rotundifolia genus it is a peculiar grape it grows in pods on stems like cherries at first it was gathered from the woods wild then it was put in vineyards high wide when harvest came sheets were put on the ground and the vines were shaken the grapes showering down they were so full of sugar that the fingers on handling them became sticky but they made a delicious wine the musky taste of which disappeared with age george washington made it as did nearly every patrician of the south at the present time scuppernong appears under many names flowers hopkins james memory and mish besides the generic variety simply known as scuppernong the northern soldiers found scuppernong wine in southern cellars

beacon this grape produced by munson in 1886 and adapted to both south and north is given first place on the authority of dr f e gladwin of the new york state grape laboratory at fredonia who has conducted experiments in florida the skin is black and the juice is aromatic and spicy it has sufficient tannin in the skins and enough tartaric acid to preserve it from wine diseases and its must possesses from 18 to 20 per cent of sugar the author has tasted its wine which is of the claret type full bodied and fragrant the use of this grape will help the south to build up a great wine industry

lomanto perfect in acid content this grape producing a claret type wine is good either for the gulf states or for the north for further description see canada 
fern munson this is the south s catawba flavored grape but its wine is deep red munson originated it in 1893 there is plenty of tannin and tartaric acid 
america this is one of munson s best wine grapes introduced in 1885 it resists the heat of the south and the cold of the north its wine is intensely red the sugar content of the must is very high and if raised to 28 per cent after using the saccharometer it can be aged into a very good natural port containing 16 per cent of alcohol without fortifying with brandy

california 
 california when it comes to wines is america but still not america california with other sections of the southwest is the only portion of the united states where european grapes vitis vinifera can be grown and these varieties prevail there almost exclusively climatically different from the east the south the north and canada its grapes differ absolutely and its methods of wine making vary by far from those of the other sections its own oenologists can direct the wine maker better than an author from the east t he californian therefore is referred to a

mission this variety is mentioned first because it is the historic grape of california brought there by the earliest fathers of the church probably by junipero sera himself it is pure european but nobody knows what it was called in the old world once says bioletti it was the only grape for white or red wine dry or sweet or for eating grown in california its berries are black carrying pigment red wine is made by fermenting fully on the skins white wine by pressing it as soon as crushed better sorts are taking its place except for the manufacture of sherry it has gained immortality from the fact that it has produced from a plant set at carpinteria california by a spanish woman in 1842 the largest grape vine in the world the trunk of this viticultural giant is eight feet in cir cumference its branches cover half an acre and it produced in 1895 according to the u s agricultural yearbook of 1907 more than ten tons of grapes

columbar this is used to make a wine of the sauterne type 
semillon this grape also produces a wine of sauterne flavor 
franken riesling though not a true riesling as grown in germany this grape makes a wine of the white rhine type when grown in the cooler sections in the hotter regions its wine is more full bodied

 canada so far has been the red headed stepchild of american wine making but under the aegis of dr e f palmer director of the ontario horticultural experiment station at vineland ontario it now promises to take a place among the viticultural countries of the world t he growing of grapes is almost entirely confined to the province of ontario ontario produces 99 5 per cent of the wine of all canada in 1900 there were 49 wineries in ontario with 373 793 in capital invested in 1932 there were 49 wineries with a capital of 7 284 862 canada had its handicap of prohibition but as in america the grip of the holy people has now been relaxed wine now a in the past is almost exclu sively confined to the product of the concord and the niagara grape both of these varieties under canadian climatic conditions are exceedingly low in sugar content averaging 13 per cent and high in tartaric acid to make endurable wine much sugar has to be added and much water artificially sugared to overcome the acid t he wine has not been altogether desirable now however the provincial government of ontario has stepped in sharply and

dr palmer has been giving scientific attention to wine problems frost comes no later in ontario influenced by the propinquity of the great lakes than it does in new york or on the north bank of the rhine the real trouble comes from the short days of september and october which do not provide enough sunshine to convert the starch in the leaves into sugar for the grapes a listing of canadian wine grapes present and prospective follows 
concord ripening perfectly but of low sugar content unless a pound or a pound and a half of cane sugar be added to the must the wine is so deficient in alcohol 7 or 8 per cent that the product is susceptible afterward despite all ordinary precautions to vinegar fermentation if raised in sugar content a fair red wine can be made by blending with other grapes however the addition of cane sugar may impart a slightly bitter taste to the product see chapter on wine making 
niagara this grape will ripen but it has no more sugar than concord and its wine has a flavor that reminds one of the taste of listerine

lomanto a black grape introduced by munson in 1902 ripening in texas the middle of july and in ontario in september with 17 per cent of sugar and an acid content of 1 20 per cent it will make port or it can be blended with concord for claret dr palmer recommends this grape to canadians without reserve

carpenter can not work without tools n either can a man make wine satisfactorily without utensils these may vary from the simplest sort of outfit to the amazing power presses and combined crushers  stemmers pressers of 
the big wineries this book does not concern the latter it is primarily for the small wine maker and if he in the course of years graduates into a big wine maker he must perforce call in the services of an expert such as the winery implement houses stand ready to provide for him below is a list of the appliances which the home wine maker and the small winery require some of them are indispensable for the former and all of them for the latter 
cellar this very strictly is not an implement but a location but it comes first and no man should try to produce wine without a cellar to provide a low and even temperature this subject will be treated at length in the chapter headed cellar and bottle

regular fermenting vats made of oak or redwood whose tops are considerably smaller than their bottoms and which can be obtained from barrel factories in all three cases heavy muslin cloths should be provided which can be closely fastened with sections of clothes line so as to hold in the vat a part of the carbon dioxide arising from fermentation all vats should be placed on heavy wooden frames or platforms 18 inches high so as to facilitate the siphoning or drawing off of the wine when the first fermentation is complete as indicated by 
the sinking of the skins siphon wells these can be constructed of large mesh wire one fourth inch heavily galvanized they are made round five or six inches in diameter and the joining can be done with fine copper wire they should be just high enough to reach beyond the top of the vat they should be covered with a single layer of cheesecloth sewed to the frame and to the bottom 
siphons these are made of rubber tubing of one half inch inside measurement and of a length sufficient to reach from the bottom of the well over the top of the vat and to a vessel on the floor they should be tied in two or three places to a piece of heavy straight wire galvanized or copper the latter preferred long enough to reach from the bottom of the well to six 
 56 who drinks more shall drink less zipoli ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ inches above the top of the vat the tube must not go to the end of the wire and in operation the tube can be made to slide upward so as to avoid clogging with the murk that is likely to gather at the bottom of the well and which must be thrown out every so often 
crusher this consists of a wooden hopper at the bottom of which are two rollers of non corroding metal or rubber which on operation of the crank revolve in opposite directions these rollers can be adjusted so that the grapes passing between them will be thoroughly crushed without any seed being broken there are arms at the bottom of the crusher which enable it to be securely placed across the top of the vat a crusher can be bought at almost every hardware store at a modest price don t get a little toy one 
press this standard implement upright and operated by hand may be bought cheaply enough at hardware stores or winery supply houses it were best not to purchase a tiny affair but a good and heavy one the more ambitious may obtain for more money pressers operated by electrical power or centrifugal pressers which look like torpedoes the smaller of which may be operated by hand the larger by power 
vessels you will require buckets preferably enameled or of copper although galvanized ware will do of three gallons capacity and if possible narrower at the top that the bottom in which the siphoned or pressed wine can be carried to the storage barrels three might do but four would be better

measuring vessels for the sake of accuracy in measuring you should have at least one u s standard gallon measure preferably of copper if you have u s bonded winery possession of measuring vessels is obligatory 
funnels large sized funnels are required for pouring the wine from buckets into barrels preferably of copper but galvanized ware will do don t get small ones or you will regret it 
gauging sticks and wantage rods these are not necessary unless you are operating under government license combined they enable you or the government inspector to determine the exact amount of wine in a full or a partly full barrel 

saccharometer this is absolutely necessary for without it you cannot ascertain the percentage of sugar in your wine must it will cost you at an instrument shop or a winery supply house from 2 50 to 4 00 
acidimeter this is not absolutely necessary unless you are operating a u s bonded winery it is useful however because it enables you to ascertain the exact amount of acid in your grape must or wine a little practice will make you proficient in its use

bung starter this cheap wooden implement will save you much trouble you may think you can remove bungs with a hammer but try it when they fit tightly and are moist 
sulphur cistern you can make this yourself out of a thin piece of metal sheeting cut and bent small enough so it will drop through the bung hole of a barrel attached on either side to wire which is stapled to the bottom of a bung and which will reach just above the barrel s bottom the wire can be of two or more sections so as to fit any barrel sulphur is put in the cistern and lighted just before it is inserted 
barrels get whatever size and whatever number you require but be sure they are made of thick oak that has no knot holes many cellar tragedies have resulted from weak and leaky barrels a good one will last for scores of years but a bad one whose staves have knots or whitish sap wood is soon done for

enemy lurks beside the real wine yeasts saccharomyces ellipsoideus of many benevolent varieties which actually create wine by transforming the sugar in your must into about 52 per cent potable alcohol 2 per cent glycerine which is a higher alcohol and 44 per cent carbonic dioxide gas which goes up in the air the other 2 per cent nourishing the yeast there are malignant yeasts and bacilli which tend to undo your work and ruin your product 
 somebody wrote many decades ago that sugar divided itself in fermentation into 50 per cent alcohol and 50 per cent carbonic gas this fallacy like many other fallacies in grape culture and wine making has been repeated by subsequent writers there are scores of such mistakes they will persist as long as writers write from other writers books instead of experience

wine that maketh glad the heart of man psalms ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the bad yeasts are called by the scientists saccharomyces apiculatus mycoderma vini of many strains torula yeasts saccharomyces anomalus saccharomyces ludwigii saccharomyces cerevisaie beer yeast saccharomyces pasteurianus now don t be scared when fermentation starts it is estimated that there are 1 000 000 cells of malevolent yeast to every single cell of real wine yeast however cheer up the one good cell kills off the 1 000 000 in a short while when proper management is practiced the true wine yeast cells multiply marvelously fast and in two or three days when fermentation is active there are 6 000 000 000 of their cells in a fluid ounce of the juice the problem is to produce such conditions that the true yeast will quickly raise the alcoholic content to 10 per cent then the battle is won if proper subsequent management is employed then there are moulds that destroy wine like the pencillium glaucum or green mould which develops on broken grapes in unclean barrels and utensils next in contradistinction to yeasts and moulds which are vegetable organisms come bacilli which be long to the animal kingdom most to be feared is the vinegar bacteria but it can be controlled easily because it cannot exist without the presence of air and is quickly killed by sulphur no acetic acid vinegar can form in a cask which is kept bung full of wine and has been subjected before use to the burning of sulphur but if these precautions are not followed this bacteria can attack the alcohol in your wine it is a toper and wants 
 62 
never did a great man hate good wine rabelais ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ nothing else and transform it into vinegar in this connection it may be noted that if the sugar content of must is raised to 26 per cent thereby producing a wine with 14 per cent alcohol neither the vinegar bacteria nor any other disease can do much to harm your wine even under medium adverse conditions other bacteria deleterious to wine are the tourne organism which produces a mousy odor and taste it is dangerous be cause unlike the vinegar bacteria it grows in the absence of air which gives little trouble in dry wines containing no sugar mannite bacteria and the bacteria which produces slimy wines 
now sit up and listen wine maker the foregoing paragraphs sound discouraging but they need not alarm you heed this cleanliness is your salvation keep your cellar and your fermenting room scrupulously clean use whitewash and disinfectants sulphur your barrels and your fermenting vats immerse your bungs in boiling water every cloth every utensil scald with boiling water every time before you use it pour boiling water through your siphons every two weeks fill vessels with sulphur and disinfect your cellar be clean be prophylactic and you never will lose an ounce of wine this advice is based on experience the author out of hatred of the sumptuary laws of his country be gan making wine fifteen years ago he planted an experimental vineyard and he consulted experts and he never has lost either from wild yeasts moulds or bacteria a cubic centimeter of wine 
some writers hold that wine should not be ameliorated

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ by the addition of cane sugar which in 48 hours mixed with the grape becomes grape sugar but if no sugar is used in the case of grapes which normally are deficient in that element or which in bad seasons are deficient so that only 13 to 15 per cent of sugar is present the wine maker will have a highly acid wine of 7 to 8 per cent alcohol nobody on earth can keep such a wine from spoiling except by pasteurization whic h impairs the quality when a variety of wine grape yields a sugar content of 22 to 24 per cent it is best to leave it alone when it is lower in sugar its content must be raised to 25 or 26 per cent which will yield a wine of 14 per cent alcohol by volume this is done as follows estimate the amount of juice you have exclusive of skins and seeds grapes differ greatly in proportions measure your sugar content by means of the saccharometer then heighten it to 25 or 26 per cent by the addition of cane sugar on the basis that one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will raise the content 9 per cent thus if you have must that has 17 per cent of sugar the addition of one pound of cane sugar to the gallon will give you a must of 26 per cent sugar producing a wine of 14 per cent alcohol 
some writers advise the amelioration of super acid wine must with water the addition of water tends to destroy the quality of any wine and the method never should be employed except when a bad season has caused the must when tested by the acidimeter to show more than 1 per cent of acid in such a case one gallon of

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ water may be added to five gallons of juice carefully calculated and this gallon of water must be sweetened with 2 1/2 pounds of sugar the normal must should previously have been raised to 25 per cent of sugar all of this is permitted by the government in its 
regulations 
the normal eastern wine grape varies from 4 per cent to 8 per cent in acid content instead of adding sugared water a process which is called gallizing after dr gall a german scientist it would be better to blend at the completion of fermentation wines having too much acid with those having too little an alternative would be the keeping of the wines in casks for a number of years as the french do during which time the superfluous tartaric acid would be cast down to the botto m in the shape of crystals making the aged wine mellow and perfect can americans have the patience for this? they ought to have 
keep water out of your wine for water can better be used in bathtubs 0r to sprinkle lawns 
having praised wine told its history described grapes that act as the tcraw material listed the needed imple ments and presented certain sanitary and ameliorating principles the next thing is to proceed to actual methods 
wandering along according to his own whim the author is going to divide processes into three categories first the traditional method which originated in ancient times and reached its perfection before pasteur came on the scene second the advanced method 
 65 
they eat and drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy milton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ which takes in on a simplified scale some of pasteur s discoveries and third the modern method of the latter very little will be said because it belongs to the big wineries and the experts at this point however the author wants to give the reader a vision of the future pasteur believed that alcohol was produced in vinous fermentation by the action of the living yeast cells on the sugar in the must if i am asked he said in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed and what is its real cause i reply that i am completely ignorant of it the scientist buchner disposed of pasteur s puzzlement just a few years ago he showed that fermentation was not the result of the growth of the living yeast cell but that it resulted from a secretion an infinitely small exudation of the yeast cell he called the secretion zymase now who knows that the scientists of the future will not be able to extract this zymase from the yeast and afterwards to create it synthetically so that the wine maker of the future will be able to pasteurize or defecate his juice by means of meta bisulphite and by adding the proper zymase ferment the most perfect wines the world has ever known a vision but who in the days of abraham lincoln could have dreamed of tele vision? always there are enough of the true yeast cells on the skins of grapes to start fermentation they hibernate in the ground and are blown onto the grapes by the wind when they begin their work in the wine must 
 66 
scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendant vintage as it grows gray 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ subsisting on sugar they immediately begin multiplication by means of buds which dropping off become new cells the rate of propagation is astonishing and as has been said in two or three days after normal fermentation begins as many as 6 000 000 000 of them exist in an ounce of must 
the management in fermentation differs in the making of red wine and white wine but since the manufacture of the former employs most of the principles used with the latter it will be considered first 
red wine 
traditional method be sure first as a preliminary that your fermenting cellar is absolutely clean its walls should be whitewashed adding a cup of dissolved salt or alum to every two gallons of the mixture purify the floor by disinfecting with chlorine or some reliable odor less commercial preparation let there be no vegetables fruits green wood or rubbish in your cellar last of all bum a few plates of sulphur in it after closing all apertures 
let every vat be scalded outside and inside with boiling water the big wineries use steam turn the vats upside down and burn just a little sulphur under each scald every portion of your crusher and your press with boiling water and do the same with every other utensil 
you are now ready to proceed with the vintage 
 67 
but still the vine her ancient ruby yields and still a garden by the water blows 
 the rubaiyat first edition ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
grapes for red wine should be allowed to reach full ripeness but 
not become over ripe they should be harvested in bright weather 
and not before all the dew on them has evaporated the berries must 
be separated from the stems from all green grapes and from grapes 
that are rotten in any degree whatsoever or have their skins broken 
for such grapes harbor the deleterious wild yeasts and bacteria the 
manner of separation may be in two ways for the small wine 
producer 1 by hand 2 by picking each bad grape out of each 
bunch then pulling the bunch across a board from one to two inches 
thick through which long nails have been driven in rows so that the 
sharp ends stand up an inch and a half the board being carved with 
run ways through which juice may flow into the pan bucket or jar 
which you are using these operations can be performed in the open 
air on a porch or under a shed by women and children the big 
wineries of course have stemming machines but they cannot 
escape if they are conscientious the laborious task of removing the 
bad grapes 
now carry the grapes to the fermenting cellar and put them through the crusher into the vat fill the vat only three fourths full for if you fill higher the expanding mass will spillover the top tie tightly with a section of clothesline heavy muslin covers over the vats twice a day thereafter remove the muslin and stir the must so that the skins floating on top will be thoroughly mixed with all the juice temperature of

drink for you know not whence you came nor why drink for you know not why you go nor where 
 the rubaiyat fourth edition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
fermenting room should be between 60 and 75 degrees fermentation raises the heat of the must and if it goes over 90 degrees the wine yeast begins to die and at 100 degrees fahrenheit it is killed absolutely the vat fermentation of red wines will last from 5 to 10 days the former at a cellar temperature of 75 degrees the latter at 60 degrees you will know when it is complete because the ticking sound will almost cease and the murk on top will begin to sink into the wine 
the first fermentation done the next two steps are siphoning off and pressing put the wells to the very bottom of the vats insert the rubber siphons have your buckets ready suck on the lower end of the tube until you get wine in your mouth then let the juice flow into the bucket spit the juice out for it wouldn t be good for you if you swallowed it remember what new wine did to noah carry the new wine into your wine cellar and pour it through a funnel into the barrel where the secondary or slow fermentation is to take place fill within three or four inches of the top then adjust your water seal before long the tup tup tup of the gas escaping through the water will make most delightful music for your ears 
at first the vat wine will flow furiously through the siphoning tube but suddenly will come a gurp and the flow will cease wait a few minutes for the well to fill again this may be expedited by lifting out the well and scraping the slimy murk off the cheesecloth covering siphon once more until there is another 
 69 
truth itself doth flow in wine samuel johnson ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ gurp and keep the process going until no more juice gathers in the well try different sides of the vat 
then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale 
this siphoned wine will be your best wine 
 next comes pressing which yields another quality the murk seeds and skins is removed into the drum of the press and the rest of the juice is extracted put a piece of strong but not too closely woven cloth previously boiled in the drum monks cloth from any department store is preferable then pour in enough of the murk to bring the height to four or six inches fold the cloth over the top of the murk put in another section of cloth and fill it in the same manner then other sections until the drum is nearly full apply pressure until no more juice runs then remove all the sections except the bottom one and place them temporarily in a pan uncovering the bottom layer of murk at its top stir it until it is loose put the other layers in and do the same thing then resume pressing repeat the loosening of the murk and the pressing until the residue is quite dry then you would best throw the murk away it will make good fertilizer some there are who would put it back in a vat add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur which will produce what is variously called piquet secondary wine or guest wine it will be strongly alcoholic but execrable the french and italians manufacture it for their laborers law all over the world forbids its sale 
 the wine obtained from the press possesses 2 or 3

 percent more alcohol than the siphoned wine it is harsher of taste containing more tannin and tartaric acid some mix it immediately with the siphoned wine but it were best to let it mature in separate casks and use it for blending afterward never does disease occur in pressed wine when correctly managed because of its high alcoholic content and its excess of tannin and tartaric 
advanced method this is where pasteur and his discoveries come in about three days before the red grapes are to be fermented take some of the ripest a gallon or more according to the size of the main fermentation put them in a small vat in a room of 70 degrees to 75 degrees temperature the temperature is imperative and in three days they will contain a maximum of wine yeast cells perhaps 6 000 000 000 to the ounce of juice when the main manufacture begins stir thoroughly into your vats a gallon of this must to every 30 gallons of new must the prepared yeast will work so quickly that no wild yeast will have a chance 
modern method science has full play in this and it is used mainly by the big wineries it consists of the employment of wine yeast cultures to start the fermentation big wineries having laboratories segregate pure yeast that has produced superior wine commercial laboratories supply many forms of pure yeast even the kinds that make the best wines in europe state experiment stations are working on it and at geneva new york 90 kinds of pure yeasts are in experimentation governments in this can aid wine makers

 oliver wendell holmes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
grape must requires special treatment before it is impregnated with these cultured yeasts every native yeast benevolent or malevolent and all bacteria must first be killed this can be done by pasteurization the raising of the temperature to 140 degrees but this is prone to destroy certain desirable qualities the favorite method is sterilization by means of potassium metabisulfite when the cultured yeast finally is added there is no competition 
the modern method is not within the scope of this book and the 
above is written mainly to stir the imagination of the reader the 
graduate of small wine manufacture into big wine making will on 
request be referred to authorities who can tell him all he wants to 
know about these ultra modern methods 
white wine 
it is a fetish long abiding that white wine has to be made from fresh juice pressed from grapes as soon as they are crushed but let the small wine maker without a power press try it if he use all his muscle on the press he can hardly extract a worth while amount of juice from grapes that have not been softened by the first stages of fermentation 
however if white wine is to be made from grapes having dissolvable red pigment in them it is obligatory that as much of the white juice as possible be extracted as soon as they are crushed what is left over can be put through the regular red wine fermentation 
 72 
drink and smile and learn to think that we were born to smile and drink 
 anacreon moore 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
certain grapes of a pink or amber hue have no dissolvable color in the skins such as catawba iona delaware and adam champagne and despite externals cannot be classed with red wine grapes they can be considered in the same category as the grapes which when ripe are green or golden green such as the ontario the elvira etc 
white wine can be made from these grapes when they are put to full fermentation on the skin and in this case the procedure is exactly that in the case of red wine such wine is full bodied astringent because of its tannin and wholesomely acid because of its tartaric it cannot spoil except under bad management 
the full process of white wine making is precisely that of the red process differing not in the slightest degree there are two other traditional processes suitable for the small wine maker 
first traditional method let the grapes after being crushed ferment in vats for a day or two until the pulp is soft then 1 siphon and 2 press the residue may be allowed to continue its fermentation in vats and there will result a very alcoholic heavy and highly flavored wine which managed precisely as red wine may delight the heart 
second traditional method by muscle and dexterity extract in the press as much of the juice as you can as soon as the grapes are pressed ferment the residue and there will be lots of it precisely as you would for red wine the product of this residue will be 
 73 
we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart shakespeare 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
several points better than the product mentioned in the paragraph 
above 
after treatment of both traditional methods the juice 
mentioned in both the preceding paragraphs should not be fermented 
in vats it should be transferred to barrels filled three fourths with 
water seals immediately inserted both the first furious fermentation 
and the later secondary slow fermentation can take place in the same 
barrels when the first fermentation is through the barrels should be 
filled to within three or four inches of the top from the contents of 
other barrels or demijohns and the second fermentation should 
proceed still under the water seals it is difficult to tell when the 
primary fermentation ends and the secondary begins so it is best to 
fill the barrels when the bubbling of the water seals becomes slow 
advanced method this is exactly the same as for red wine except that under the first traditional method for white wine the whole starter skins and pulp should be added to the grapes as soon as crushed whereas in the second traditional method only the juice from the starter should be added to the freshly pressed juice of the grape see red wine paragraph entitled advanced method 
modern method this is applicable only to freshly pressed juice defecated by means of potassium metabisulfite and filtered pure yeast culture is then added only big wineries can do it 
this ends the instructions on primary processes but you are not done yet wine maker wait until you step into your wine cellar

vi cellar and bottle 

~ your cellar wine maker is 
like the cell of an old

in it you succeed or fail in 
transmuting your raw material 
into as perfect a product as 
possible 
if you have followed the directions of the last chapter you have a fine chance of success but if you ignore good wine practice in your cellar you will fail 
now this cellar should be separate from your fermenting room and always dark it should be whitewashed and made sanitary exactly as your fermenting room was keep everything out of it except your wine and your appliances no vegetable no fruit no rubbish if you have a cellar under your residence you can partition it off part for your fermenting room part for the true wine cellar if you have a steep hillside and some money you can drive straight in with a stemming room outside under a shed a fermenting room a little further in partly covered with earth and a real cellar still further this arrangement will constitute a small winery ready for licensing by the united states government but before you go that far learn by your own experience how to make good and salable wine

dissolved overnight in a small quantity of wine stir these materials into the cask and in a few days the solid materials will be carried down to the lees bigger wineries will use filtration or centrifuging 
machines with less injury to the bouquet and flavor of the wine racking consists of siphoning the wine off the lees into another cask two or three rackings are usually sufficient these should be made in bright weather 
don t buy cheap bottles and don t buy cheap corks when it comes to bottling choose a bright sunshiny day put your corks in water brought to a boil to soften them but do not boil them if you have strong fingers you can insert the corks until their tops reach just below the tops of the bottles however a corking machine is desirable and quite cheap 
when your wine thoroughly matured in the oak is bottled then comes bottle management they are laid on their sides in tiers so that the corks are always in contact with the wine in the barrels your wine will have been ameliorated because crystals of tartaric acid will have been thrown down to the bottom in bottles there will be no more of this but something infinitely more important will occur the acids working on the alcohol will produce in the bottles what scientific men call esters or ethers the most important one being the oenanthic ester wine aroma in five or six years american wine in the bottle should reach its acme of excellence

the repeal of prohibition was the signal for the appearance of a number of very fine and sophisticated books on the consumption and connoisseurship of wine they were delightful in the reading they said one particular wine should be drunk with one

particular kind of food that another wine went with another course 
and that still another sort of wine went with another sort of food 
that red meat and chicken and some sort of cheese required red 
wine as did spa ghetti that sherry accompanied soup that fish 
required white wine that champagne was appropriate to any sort of 
food that sweets needed a cordial wine like sauterne etc etc 
etc 

these picturesque and entertaining books repeated the dicta of chefs and maitres d hotel for a hundred and more years somebody first put it in print and then it was repeated over and over again by subsequent writers the directions white wine for this red wine for that sherry for this port for that champagne for everything cordials for sweets have been repeated so many times that they have become a sort of parrots jamboree

if you swallowed it ( remember what new wine did to Noah) .Carry the new wine into your wine cellar and pour it through a funnel into the barrel where the secondary ( or slow) fermentation is to take place. Fill within three or four inches of the top, then adjust your water seal. Before long the "tup! tup tup!" of the gas escaping through the water will make most delightful music for your ears. 
At first the vat wine will flow furiously through the siphoning tube. But suddenly will come a "gurp!" and the flow will cease. Wait a few minutes for the "well" to fill again. This may be expedited by lifting out the "well" and scraping the slimy murk off the cheesecloth covering. Siphon once more, until there is another

Then you would best throw the murk away. It will make good fertilizer. Some there are who would put it back in a vat, add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur, which will produce what is variously called piquet, secondary wine, or guest wine. It will be strongly alcoholic, but execrable.  The French and Italians manufacture it for their laborers. Law, all over the world, forbids its sale. 
This siphoned. wine will be your best wine.
 Next comes pressing, which yields another quality. The murk (seeds and skins) is removed into the drum of the press and the rest of the juice is extracted. Put a piece of strong but not too closely woven cloth, previously boiled, in the drum, ( monks' cloth, from any department store, is preferable) .Then pour in enough of the murk to bring the height to four or six inches. Fold the cloth over the top of the murk. Put in another section of cloth and fill it in the same manner. Then other sections until the drum is nearly full. Apply pressure until no more juice runs. Then remove all the sections except the bottom one and place them temporarily in a pan. Uncovering the bottom layer of murk at its top, stir it until it is loose. Put the other layers in and do the same thing. Then resume pressing. Repeat the loosening of the murk and the pressing until the residue is quite dry. Then you would best throw the murk away. It will make good fertilizer. Some there are who would put it back in a vat, add a few gallons of water with two and a half pounds of sugar dissolved in each gallon and let another fermentation occur, which will produce what is variously called piquet, secondary wine, or guest wine. It will be strongly alcoholic, but execrable. The French and Italians manufacture it for their laborers. Law, all over the world, forbids its sale.
 The wine obtained from the press possesses 2 or 3 
[70] 
Whom, have the flowing goblets not made eloquent?-Horace 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 percent more alcohol than the siphoned wine. It is harsher of taste, containing more tannin and tartaric acid. Some mix it immediately with the siphoned wine, but it were best to let it mature in separate casks and use it for blending afterward. Never does disease occur in pressed wine, when correctly managed, because of its high alcoholic content, and its excess of tannin and tartaric. 
Advanced Method-This is where Pasteur and his discoveries come in. About three days before the red grapes are to be fermented, take some of the ripest, a gallon or more, according to the size of the main fermentation, put them in a small vat in a room of 70 degrees to 75 degrees temperature (the temperature is imperative) , and in three days they will contain a maximum of wine yeast cells, perhaps 6,000,000,000 to the ounce of juice. When the main manufacture begins, stir thoroughly into your vats a gallon of this must to every 30 gallons of new must. The prepared yeast will work so quickly that no wild yeast will have a chance. 
Modern Method-Science has full play in this, and it is used mainly by the big wineries. It consists of the employment of wine yeast cultures to start the fermentation. Big wineries having laboratories segregate pure yeast that has produced superior wine. Commercial laboratories supply many forms of pure yeast, even the kinds that make the best wines in Europe. State experiment stations are working on it, and at Geneva, New York, 90 kinds of pure yeasts are in experimentation. Governments in this can aid wine makers. 
Come a fresh bumper, for why should we go 
While the nectar still reddens our cups as they flow?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Grape must requires special treatment before it is impregnated with these cultured yeasts. Every native yeast, benevolent or malevolent, and all bacteria, must first be killed. This can be done by pasteurization ( the raising of the temperature to 140 degrees) , but this is prone to destroy certain desirable qualities. The favorite method is sterilization by means of potassium metabisulfite. When the cultured yeast finally is added there is no competition. 
The Modern Method is not within the scope of this book, and the 
above is written mainly to stir the imagination of the reader. The 
graduate of small wine manufacture into big wine making will, on 
request, be referred to authorities who can tell him all he wants to 
know about these ultra-modern methods. 
WHITE WINE 
It is a fetish, long abiding, that white wine has to be made from fresh juice pressed from grapes as soon as they are crushed. But let the small wine maker, without a power press, try it. If he use all his muscle on the press he can hardly extract a worth while amount of juice from grapes that have not been softened by the first stages of fermentation. 
However, if white wine is to be made from grapes having dissolvable red pigment in them, it is obligatory that as much of the white juice as possible be extracted as soon as they are crushed. What is left over can be put through the regular red wine fermentation. 
[72] 
Drink. and smile and learn to think. That we were born to smile and drink.. 
-Anacreon (Moore). 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Certain grapes of a pink or amber hue have no dissolvable color in the skins (such as Catawba, Iona, Delaware and Adam Champagne) and, despite externals, cannot be classed with red wine grapes. They can be considered in the same category as the grapes which when ripe are green or golden green ( such as the Ontario, the Elvira, etc.). 
White wine can be made from these grapes when they are put to full fermentation on the skin, and in this case the procedure is exactly that in the case of red wine. Such wine is full bodied, astringent because of its tannin, and wholesomely acid because of its tartaric. It cannot spoil except under bad management. 
The full" process of white wine making is precisely that of the red process, differing not in the slightest degree. There are two other traditional processes suitable for the small wine maker. 
First Traditional Method-Let the grapes, after being crushed, ferment in vats for a day or two, until the pulp is soft. Then (1) siphon and (2) press. The residue may be allowed to continue its fermentation in vats, and there will result a very alcoholic, heavy and highly flavored wine, which, managed precisely as red wine, may delight the heart. , 
Second Traditional Method-By muscle and dexterity, extract in the press as much of the juice as you can, as soon as the grapes are pressed. Ferment the residue ( and there will be lots of it) precisely as you would for red wine. The product of this residue will be 
[73] 
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.-Shakespeare. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Several points better than the product mentioned in the paragraph 
above. 
After Treatment of Both Traditional Methods -The juice 
mentioned in both the preceding paragraphs should not be fermented 
in vats. It should be transferred to barrels, filled three-fourths, with 
water seals immediately inserted. Both the first furious fermentation 
and the later secondary slow fermentation can take place in the same 
barrels. When the first fermentation is through, the barrels should be 
filled to within three or four inches of the top from the contents of 
other barrels or demijohns, and the second fermentation should 
proceed, still under the water seals. It is difficult to tell when the 
primary fermentation ends and the secondary begins, so it is best to 
fill the barrels when the bubbling of the water seals becomes slow. 
Advanced Method-This is exactly the same as for red wine, except that under the First Traditional Method for white wine the whole ((starter" ( skins and pulp) should be added to the grapes as soon as crushed, whereas in the Second Traditional Method only the juice from the ((starter" should be added to the freshly pressed juice of the grape. (See red wine paragraph entitled ((Advanced Method.") 
Modern Method- This is applicable only to freshly pressed juice, defecated by means of potassium metabisulfite, and filtered. Pure yeast culture is then added. Only big wineries can do it. 
This ends the instructions on primary processes. But you are not done yet, wine maker! Wait until you step into your wine cellar. 
[74] 
VI Cellar and Bottle 

~ Your cellar, wine maker, is 
like the cell of an old. 
Arabian alchemist. 
In it you succeed or fail in 
transmuting your raw material 
into as perfect a product as 
possible. 
If you have followed the directions of the last chapter, you have a fine chance of success; but if you ignore good wine practice in your cellar, you will fail. 
Now , this cellar should be separate from your fermenting room, and always dark. It should be whitewashed and made sanitary exactly as your fermenting room was. Keep everything out of it except your wine and your appliances,-no vegetable, no, fruit, no rubbish. If you have a cellar under your residence, you can partition it off, part for your fermenting room, part for the true wine cellar. If you have a steep hillside, and some money, you can drive straight in,-with a stemming room outside under a shed, a fermenting room a little further in, partly covered with earth, and a real cellar still further. This arrangement will constitute a small winery, ready for licensing by the United States government. But before you go that far, learn, by your own experience how to make good and salable wine.

-The Rubaiyat, Fourth Edition. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mount your barrels, heads fronting the passageway, on strong frames, not platforms, 18 inches high. Scald each barrel inside and outside with boiling water, and sulphur each of them inside by means of your sulphur cistern, previously described. First, your barrels will be filled with new wine, red or white, under water seals. When these water seals cease to bubble, you may know that your wine has passed altogether through the first and secondary fermentations. Remove the water seals, rack your wine by means of siphons into clean and sulphured barrels, and fill them until the wine overflows the bunghole. Drive in the bung. As often as is necessary, pour in more wine so as to make it overflow the bunghole. This operation is called by the French "ullage." It is vital, because it excludes disease. In the spring, when the grapes flower, there will be a slight tertiary (or third) fermentation; and when the new grapes ripen in September or October there will be slight fourth fermentation. Then the wine may be considered as "made." The bungs then may be sealed with wax or paraffine, "ullage" thereafter can be performed every six months, the wine's quality can be watched, and when the proper time comes you can put it in bottles. The process of "fining" is seldom needed in the states East of the Rocky Mountains. Usually three or four rackings of the wine is enough to give it brilliance. However, a deficiency of tannin may cause the wine to stay murky. In this case the small wine maker can

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ dissolve white of egg, beaten and allowed to settle, or is in glass 
dissolved overnight in a small quantity of wine. Stir these materials into the cask and in a few days the solid materials will be carried down to the lees. Bigger wineries will use filtration or centrifuging 
machines, with less injury to the bouquet and flavor of the wine. "Racking" consists of siphoning the wine off the lees into another cask. Two or three rackings are usually sufficient. These should be made in bright weather. 
Don't buy cheap' bottles, and don't buy cheap corks. When it comes to bottling, choose a bright, sunshiny day. Put your corks in water brought to a boil to soften them, but do not boil them. If you have strong fingers, you can insert the corks until their tops reach just below the tops of the bottles. However, a corking machine is desirable, and quite cheap. 
When your wine, thoroughly matured in the oak, is bottled, then comes ""bottle management." They are laid on their sides, in tiers, so that the corks are always in contact with the wine. In the barrels your wine will have been "ameliorated" because crystals of tartaric acid will have been thrown down to the bottom. In bottles there will be no more of this, but something infinitely more important will occur. The acids, working on the alcohol, will produce in the bottles what scientific men call esters (or ethers) , the most important one being the oenanthic ester (wine aroma) .In five or six years American wine, in the bottle, should reach its acme of excellence.

-The Rubaiyat, Fourth Edition. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SOME ADDENDA The preceding part of this chapter and the whole of the one before it have been devoted to dry red wine and dry white wine. For the sake of a complete record, the author proceeds to other classifications, perhaps out of the range of his readers. 
CONCORD POSSIBILITIES-The author has promised to give directions for the making of a drinkable wine from Concord grapes. All right! If the author were named Hercules he would consider this his thir teenth labor. But, all right! You can't, as the venerable aphorism says, make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but who knows, in these scientific days, if something like rayon may not be made from the aural appendage of a female hog. First Concord Method-Gather the despised Concord when it is fully ripe, not over-ripe; test it by the saccharometer (which will not register more than 13 to 16 per cent of sugar) and raise its sugar content to 20 per cent, which will deliver to you (approximately) a wine of 11 per cent alcohol; when the second fermentation is complete, drink it without delay, be cause if you don't you'll have nothing but vinegar-or worse. Second Concord Method - As soon as you crush the grapes, press out what white juice you can; raise the sugar content of this to 22 per cent; treat exactly as white wine; the residue you can ferment as in the First Concord Method." Third Concord Method-Raise the

Fourth Concord Method-Raise the sugar content to 29 or 30 per cent; macerate the stems as described above; ferment in the vats until the murk sinks; when it is in the casks add some caramel (sugar burnt until it is brown-black) , some cinnamon, some licorice (or aniset) , just a little glycerine, some oil of lemon, a little calamus, some tartaric acid if the wine is too flat (establish all the proportions by experiment) ; and, if you can, add enough brandy, or alcohol, to give the wine 22 per cent alcoholic content; and this, if you properly age it, will be as good Port as you can get from Europe at $2.00 the quart, and without an injurious element in it. SHERRY -Iona, Catawba, Delaware and Adam Champagne wine in the East can be transformed into Sherry. Raise the must to 28 per cent" of sugar, which will deliver a wine of 16 per cent alcohol. In the follow ing summer, after its production in the fall, expose it to high temperatures, either in direct sunshine, protected with heavy blankets at night, or in attics, that grow super-heated by the sunshine on the roof. If this high temperature be kept up for four months, all of the wine

[Jerez became in English Sherries."] In California, the wine from Mission and Palomino grapes, treated to this hot amelioration, produces the same results. However, Sherry, to be like Spanish Sherry, should have brandy added to it, at various stages of heating, until, at the end its alcoholic content will be about 21 per cent. Also some burnt sugar. Of course, Sherry can be perfected " by the use of Sherry flavor," now on the market. But don't do it! 
PORT-This is a generic name for a dark, or tawny, red wine, highly alcoholized by the addition-of brandy. It became the :first wine of England because of the treaty that Lord Methuen made with Portugal to spite France. But when is Port actually Port? To use a Gilbertian term, its purity has been: what, never? -well hardly ever." Americans, using a dark red wine, whose fermentative juice has been raised to 29 per cent, can produce a wine registering 16% per cent of alcohol. By means of brandy or pure grain alcohol, this can be raised to 22 degrees or 24 degrees. By the addition of cinnamon, licorice (aniset), capsicum, Cassia, Quassia, Calamus, lemon oil, burnt sugar:, and other things, a really perfect imitation of Port can be produced. 
ANGELICA-This considerable product of California is not a fermented wine at all. Certain delicious juices from California grapes are extracted, defecated by the addition of potassium metabisulifite, properly

It is not wine, but it is a nice, sweet drink for ladies." 
CHAMPAGNE-The making of this wine involves a highly complicated and expensive process that cannot interest the readers of this book. It is true that a pseudo-Champagne can be produced from any good white wine by means of gas from a carbonic torpedo, like soda water, or by putting into the bottle a little dry ice." Such Champagne is worthless. It will sparkle for three or four minutes,whereas real Champagne will effervesce for half an hour. Anyone actually interested in the production of real Champagne is invited to communicate with the author, in care of the Orange Judd Publishing Company. 
Now, having made good wine, how are you going to drink it? The next chapter will take up that extremely important subject.

VII 
De Gustibus 

The repeal of Prohibition was the signal for the appearance of a number of very fine and sophisticated books on the consumption and connoisseurship of wine. They were delightful in the' reading. They said one particular wine should be drunk with one
~ 
particular kind of food, that another wine went with another course, 
and that still another sort of wine went with another sort of food; 
that red meat and chicken and some sort of cheese required red 
wine, as did spa ghetti; that Sherry accompanied soup; that fish 
required white wine; that Champagne was appropriate to any sort of 
food; that sweets needed a cordial wine, like Sauterne; etc., etc., 
etc. 

These picturesque and entertaining books repeated the dicta of chefs and maitres d'hotel for a hundred and more years. Somebody first put it in print, and then it was repeated over and over again by subsequent writers. The directions,-white wine for this, red wine for that, Sherry for this, Port for that, Champagne for everything, cordials for sweets,-have been repeated so many times that they have become a sort of parrots' jamboree.

The writers of these books were talking to rich customers. Who 
in the world serves all these European wines at dinner parties, either 
at their homes or at restaurants, except city slickers" and men of 
great wealth or city salesmen who are trying to please out of town 
buyers"? The instruction in these books does not belong to the little 
wine maker for whom this book was written. If the little fellow, the 
only one the author cares about, wants to pull off a state party, 
having for his guests the Marchioness Quiff-Quaff, the Duke of 
Down-Down, Herr Hitler, Signor Mussolini, the Prince of Wales, 
Stalin and the Emperor of Japan, it were best that he call in a caterer, 
who will provide the proper glasses, the proper wines and the proper 
food. He can get all this for $2,000 or $3,000,-perhaps. Glasses? The idea that their shape has anything to do with the enjoyment of wine is simply bunk, and no American citizen with any ability to think should give the matter his attention. Such things belong only to the imaginations of the aesthetes. What does amount to something, however, is the color 0'f the glass. Wine should never be poured into a glass of any other color than pure crystal-which means no color at all. Talleyrand in his historic dictum has told us to look at the wine first, and enjoy its color; to lift it to the nostril and enjoy the bouquet; then to convey it to the mouth and enjoy the taste. Through the crystal glass you can

The first dukes of Burgundy established vineyards on their own account; and we learn from their ancient ordinances, how much theyprided themselves on the possession of the finest wine countries in Christendom, and the duke of Burgundy was often designated by the title of"prince of good wines."-William Robert Prince, 1830. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ enjoy the color, whether it be red as the ruby; have the sparkle of the garnet; present the precious yellow of gold, the pure white of Rhenish, or the greenish-silver of the wine made from the Ontario grape. 
The aesthetes are right on one point. A heavy wine, with much aroma, should be served in a large glass, filled half way. Twirl such a glass and you will get all the bouquet. 
To debunk" the wine glass is one thing; to debunk" the idea of the connoisseur-writer that wine in America should be served with meals, and not otherwise, is another. Yet it ought not to be difficult. 
The great mass of Americans have always drunk wine as a between-meals beverage,-an intoxicant, if you like. They care not at all for it as a fluid to wash down foods, as do the French and the Italians. For an hour or two before dinner the American will want to drink wine, but when wine is set before him at dinner, he will take very little of it. The author of this book has tried it out at his home on college professors, newspaper editors, publishers, scientists, authors of best sellers, and many others. They wanted their wine before, not dur ing the meal. White wine with fish? --the glasses were untouched. Red wine with chicken or beef?-the chicken or beef was eaten, but the wine was not drunk. 
This advice to the American who makes his own wine and consumes it: Let your taste be your guide. If you

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ can't enjoy wine (and if you can't enjoy wine surely you can't drink beer) with your meals, call it off! Eat your fill, and take your customary coffee. But if you have been drinking wine before the meal, take no milk. When wine or milk are mixed, all the laws of chemistry smack at you. Before the meal, drink all you ought to have of wine. Put your best wine before your guests and give them all they ought to have. But no more, be a considerate host. In spite of the French arid the Italians, never mind the meal. When people are hungry, they are not thirsty. Transmogrify yourself all you like,-if you are; American and Anglo-Saxon, you cannot escape racial facts. 
Neither the national government nor the state governments have ever taken the question of aiding the wine maker very much to heart. The entrenched" whisky and gin interests, by means of independent propaganda have, since Repeal, easily swung the nation into a hard liquor" country. The manufacturers of beer have had their say. Yet the United States has no nook or portion which will not produce wine,-and the United States is almost as big as all Europe combined (3,738,393 square miles as compared with Europe's 3,776,700) .The isothermal line that cuts the great northern portion of Europe off from wine production, does not touch the United States, though it excludes half of Europe.

Even when they stand before the Pearly Gates, they either have.-or wish they had-hip flasks. It would be a great thing if they could be taught that the proper consumption of pure dry wines would cause them to confront St. Peter with better livers and better kidneys,-and, may hap, better consciences. 
If America, in the course of years, can be made a wine drinking country, it would greatly advantage the people, and, moreover, it would forever make impossible the return of the ogre-Prohibition. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Now comes the most important paragraph in this book. Take it to heart, wine maker! Take it to heart!! Having made your wine, consume it, with food or without, as suits your whim. If you want to drink it at dinner, let your taste be your guide-in spite of Savarin or anybody else. But this author knows you will drink it, nine cases out of ten, just by itself and between meals. Now then: Don't drink too much of it.
