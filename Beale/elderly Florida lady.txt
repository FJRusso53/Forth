An elderly Florida lady did her shopping and upon returning to her car found four males in the act of leaving with her vehicle
She dropped her shopping bags and drew her handgun proceeding to scream at the top of her lungs 
I have a gun and I know how to use it Get out of the car
The four men didnt wait for a second threat They got out and ran like mad
The lady somewhat shaken then proceeded to load her shopping bags into the back of the car and got into the drivers seat 
She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition
She tried and tried and then she realized why 
It was for the same reason she had wondered why there was a football a Frisbee and two 12 packs of beer in the front seat 
A few minutes later she found her own car parked four or five spaces farther down
She loaded her bags into the car and drove to the police station to report her mistake
The sergeant to whom she told the story couldnt stop laughing He pointed to the other end of the counter where four pale men were reporting a car jacking by a mad elderly woman described as white less than five feet tall glasses curly white hair and carrying a large handgun
No charges were filed
The moral of the story
If youre going to have a senior moment make it a memorable one
