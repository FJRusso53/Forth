prayer in the morning 
blessed be the lord the god of israel 
he has come to his people and set them free 
he has raised up for us a mighty savior 
born of the house of his servant david 
through his holy prophets he promised of old 
that he would save your supplies 
us from our enemies 
from the hands of all who hate us 
he promised to show mercy to our fathers 
and to remember his holy covenant 
this was the oath he swore to our father abraham 
to set us free from the hands of our enemies 
free to worship him without fear 
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life 
you my child shall be called the prophet of the most high 
for you will go before the lord to prepare his way 
to give his people knowledge of salvation 
by the forgiveness of their sins 
in the tender compassion of our god 
the dawn from on high shall break upon us 
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death 
and to guide our feet into the way of peace

prayer in the evening 
my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord 
my spirit rejoices in god my savior 
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant 
from this day all generations will call me blessed 
the almighty has done great things for me 
and holy is his name 
he has mercy on those who fear him 
in every generation is a mess
he has shown the strength of his arm 
he has scattered the proud in their conceit 
he has cast down the mighty from their thrones 
and has lifted up the lowly 
he has filled the hungry with good things 
and the rich he has sent away empty 
he has come to the help of his servant israel 
for he has remembered his promise of mercy 
the promise he made to our fathers 
to abraham and his children forever

behold the handmaid of the lord 
be it done unto me according to your word 
and the word was made flesh 
and dwelt among us 
pray for us o holy mother of god 
that we may be made worthy of the promises of christ 
let us pray 
pour forth we beseech you o lord 
your grace into our hearts 
that as we have known the incarnation of christ 
your son be the message of an angel 
so by his passion and cross 
we may be brought to the glory of his resurrection 
through the same christ our lord amen 

evening prayer 
o my god 
at the end of this day i thank 
you most heartly for all the graces 
i have received from you 
i am sorry that i have not made better use of them 
i am sorry for all the sins i have committed against you 
forgive me o my god and graciously protect me this night 
blessed virgin mary my dear heavenly mother 
take me us under you protection 
saint joesph my dear guardian angel 
and all you saints of god pray for me us 
sweet jesus have pity on me us and on all poor souls and sinners 
and save them and us from hell 
have mercy on the suffering souls in purgatory 

seeds of success 

god thank you for this day 
know have not accomplished as yet all you expect of me and if that is your reason for bathing me in the fresh dew of another dawn am most grateful 
am prepared at last to make you proud of me 
will forget yesterday with all its trials and tribulations aggravations and setbacks angers and frustrations the past is already dream from which can neither 
retrieve single word nor erase any foolish deeds 
will resolve however that if have injured anyone yesterday through my thoughtlessness will not let this day’ sun set before make amends and nothing do today 
will be of greater importance 
will not fret the future my success and happiness does not depend on straining to see what lurks dimly on the horizon but to do this day what lies clearly at hand 
will treasure this day for it is all have know that its rushing hours cannot be accumulated or stored like precious grain for future use 
will live as all good actors do when they are onstage only in the moment cannot perform at my best today by regretting my previous act mistakes or 
worrying about the scene to come 
will embrace today difficult tasks take off my coat and make dust in the world will remember that the busier am the less harm am apt to suffer the tastier will 
be my food the sweeter my sleep and the better satisfied will be with my place in the world 
will free myself today from slavery to the clock and calendar although will plan this day in order to conserve my steps and energy will begin to measure my life in deeds not 
years in thoughts not seasons in feelings not figures on dial 
will remain aware of how little it takes to make this happy day never will pursue happiness because it is not goal just by product and there is no happiness in having or in 
getting only in giving 
will run from no danger might encounter today because am certain that nothing will happen to me that am not equipped to handle with your help just as any gem is 
polished by friction am certain to become more valuable through this day adversities and if you close one do or you always open another for me 
will live this day as if it were christmas will be giver of gifts and deliver to my enemies the gift of forgiveness my opponents tolerance my friends smile my 
children good example and every gift will be wrapped with unconditional love 
will waste not even precious second today in anger or hate or jealousy or selfishness know that the seeds sow will harvest because every action good or bad is 
always followed by an equal reaction will plant only good seeds this day 
will treat today as priceless violin one may draw harmony from it and another discord yet no one will blame the instrument life is the same and if play it 
correctly it will give forth beauty but if play it ignorantly it will produce ugliness 
will condition myself to look on every problem encounter today as no more than 
pebble in my shoe remember the pain so harsh could hardly walk and recall my surprise when removed my shoe and found only grain of sand 
will work convinced that nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm to do anything today that is truly worth doing must not stand back shivering and 
thinking of the cold and danger but jump in with gusto and scramble through as well as can 
will face the world with goals set for this day but they will be attainable ones not the vague impossible variety declared by those who make career of failure 
realize that you always try me with little first to see what would do with lot 
will never hide my talents if am silent am forgotten if do not advance will fall back if walk away from any challenge today my self esteem will be forever 
will keep smile on my face and in my heart even when it hurts today know that the world is looking glass and gives back to me the reflection of my own soul now 
understand the secret of correcting the attitude of others and that is to correct my own 
will turn away from any temptation today might cause me to break my word or that lose my self respect am positive that the more valuable than my only thing 
possess life is my honor will work this day with all my strength content in the knowledge that life does not consist of wallowing in the past or peering 
anxiously at the future it is appalling to contemplate the great number of painful steps by which one arrives at truth so old so obvious and so frequently 
expressed whatever it offers little or much my life is now 
will pause whenever am feeling sorry for myself today and remember that this is the only day have and must play it to the fullest what my part may signify in the 
great whole may not recognize but am here to play it and now is the time will count this day separate life will remember that those who have fewest regrets are 
those who take each moment as it comes for all that it is worth 

this is my day 
these are my seeds 
thank you god for this precious garden of time 

psalm 23 for the work place 

the lord is my real boss and shall not want 
he gives me peace when chaos is all around me 
he gently reminds me to pray and do all things without murmuring and complaining 
he reminds me that he is my source and not my job 
he restores my sanity everyday and guides my decisions that might honor him in all that do even though face an absurd amount of mails system crashes unrealistic 
deadlines budget cutbacks gossiping coworkers discriminating supervisors and an aging body that doesn cooperate every morning still will not stop for he is with 
me his presence his peace and his power will see me through he raises me up even when they fail to promote me he claims me as his own even when the company 
threatens to let me go his faithfulness and love are better than any bonus check 
his retirement plan beats every 401k there is when it all said and done 
i'll be working for him whole lot longer and for that bless his name 

patience

how balanced am in my relationships with others 
are there any relationships in my life that test my patience to the max why 
how well do balance between those things in my life that are the most pressing as distinct from those things that are the most important 
do have to get everything done immediately 
do really listen to others am careful or considerate when respond 
how well do deal with changes in my life 
how well do roll with the punches of everyday life 

our daily bread

you need patience to do god will and receive what he has promised hebrews 10 36 
it is difficult in an age where the delay of any gratification is looked on as an evil or at least an unfortunate impediment to the good life tremendous cultural 
forces urge us on to get what we want now and to postpone the consequences until later writes eugene kennedy in time for love 
wise men and women know that patience and suffering are essential characteristics of life itself it is no wonder that st paul put patience first in his 
description of love characteristics 

patience is the strength that is needed if relationships are to retain their vitality 

patience is the strength that is needed if relationships are to retain their vitality 
salesian spirituality stresses this truth in our relationships with god our neighbor and ourselves our journey to holiness requires patience it is core issue in 
surrendering our lives for purpose total change of priorities and motivation it is the readiness to die ourselves to give life to others it is the living out of 
the mystery of life in christ that is real religion 

patience is not laziness indifference nor lack of common sense true patience accepts not only the great and heavy trials that occasionally come our way but also 
the petty troubles and annoying accidents of every day this means being patient not

patience is not laziness indifference nor lack of common sense 

only in the face of great sickness but with minor annoyances that god sends or permits it means being patient with where god wills us to be patient with those 
with whom he has surrounded us patient with whatever circumstance he permits the final and most excellent lesson on patience writes st francis de sales is when 
patience with our neighbor becomes part of out hearts we are always anxious that others put up with our miseries and that they tolerate us yet the miseries and 
faults of our neighbors always seem so great and unsupportable 

we must be patient and little by little eliminate our unacceptable traits and control our emotions life is continual struggle between hope and fear god is always 
ready to help us never tire of fighting for your growth toward perfection the truly patient person is not whiner nor desires to be pitied by others during hard 
times 

salesian spirituality tells us to be patient with everyone but above all with ourselves don be disturbed about your imperfections and always have the courage to 
pick yourself up after fall there is no better way to growing toward perfection

salesian spirituality tells us to be patient with everyone but above all with ourselves 
in the spiritual life than to always be starting over again and again and never thinking we have done enough 

practicing patience in our ordinary lives will thrust our energies toward spiritual growth parent simple demonstration of gentle patient reprimand has far 
greater power in correcting child than rage and passion just remember that god demonstrates an incredible amount of patience with us 
in this life patience should be our daily bread 
accepting yourself

what was your dream for yourself when you were growing up 
have you achieved that or continued to work toward that dream 
if not what has changed 
are you willing to accept the fact that some of your dreams may go unfulfilled 
have you tried to the best of your ability to live life to the fullest 
what are the obstacles inside you and around you that make it difficult for you’re to love and accept yourself 
how might you eliminate or reduce these obstacles 

where you are in life

persevere in thoroughly conquering yourself in the small daily contradictions you receive make the bulk of your desires about this know that god wishes nothing 
of you at present but that busy not yourself then in doing anything else do not sow your desires in another garden but cultivate well your own do not desire not 
to be what you are but desire to be very well what you are occupy your thoughts in making that perfect and in bearing the crosses little or great which you will 
meet believe me this is the great truth and the least understood in spiritual conduct st francis de sales 

when we were growing up we were taught that we could become whatever we wanted to be most of us had dreams of becoming someone great and doing wonderful things 
for humanity but what we become is often nothing like our dreams still many of us continue to dream we are still waiting for opportunities to do something great 
for god and so are not satisfied with who we are or what we are doing now 

we continue to be concerned about our abilities our productivity and if we are keeping up with our neighbors 
what concerns us most is how we come across to others whether our efforts are great enough to be recognized by others or whether we can be just like someone else 
that we admire 
we worry about what we are not am not the leader in my community or am not the most patient or most generous person we are often not satisfied with who we are 
and overlook our gifts and strengths as insignificant or unimportant but st francis de sales reminds us 
busy not yourself then in doing anything else do not sow your desires in another’ garden but cultivate well your own 
how do we put this advice into practice in everyday life through prayer and reflection we can come to understand our own strengths and come to know that god will 
for us each day is great regardless of whether it affects nation or just one person 
in daily prayer call to mind at the beginning of the day what you expect to take place and how you can follow jesus through your actions examine your conscience 
at the end of the day to review how successful you ve been by keeping in mind what your goal is for this day and what gifts god gave you to share you can enjoy 
each moment because it will already be dedicated to god will 
it is freeing experience not to have to worry about what will the neighbors think as long as we follow in jesus footsteps this gives us the opportunity to be 
thankful for what talents god has given us stop and think about it by appreciating the very moment you ve shared laugh with loved one or taught child anew 
concept we thank god for our abilities and we thank god for who we are this is all god is asking of us jesus tells us that the seed sown on rich soil is the one 
who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields hundred or sixty or thirty fold mt 13 23 
we can best honor god swill by focusing on our talents accepting who we are and by being open to god by living in the present moment 

the talents and abilities god gives us for our use to accomplish the divine will at each moment in time is his gift to us by recognizing this and accepting it we 
can see more clearly god will for us and can better discern god swill in others lives we can best bear the fruit or use our talents by accepting who we are right 
now and being open to god who lives in each present moment 
temptations

what kinds of temptations do you most frequently encounter 
what strategies do you employ for resisting them 
what opposite virtues could you practice to counter these temptations 
do you have spiritual director confessor or friend who can support your efforts to resist temptation and practice virtue 

encountering and countering them

the salesian tradition identifies three steps that can lead to sin 
the sin great or small is suggested 
the person being tempted is either pleased or displeased with the suggestion 
the person either consents to the temptation or refuses it 
let us be clear being tempted is not in itself sinful temptations cannot make us displeasing to god unless we delight in them and / or consent to them counsels 
st francis de sales let the enemies of our salvation set before us their snares and allurements as much as they like let them remain always at the door of our 
hearts seeking entrance let them make as many proposals as they like as long as we are determined to take no pleasure in this we can never of fend god 
our first line of defense against temptations is to turn our attention from them but to do so gently calmly and simply st jane de chantal recommends that we pay 
no attention to them doing whatever is necessary to take our minds off them yourhods however forceful must reflect moderation 
this moderation is critical if we overreact to the presence of temptations we may actually reduce our ability to resist them losing our cool in the face of 
temptations merely increases our spiritual turmoil allowing satan to fish as it were in troubled waters 
strategies for countering specific temptation depend upon the size or nature of the temptation itself 
temptations cannot make us displeasing to god unless we delight in them and / or consent to them 
great temptations may resist our efforts to simply turn away from them in fact they may actually pursue us remedies for dealing with this type include 
unite yourself with the crucified christ 
speak of it with spiritual director confessor or trusted friend 
resolve to be as stubborn and determined as the temptation itself 
most of all do not look at the temptation nor argue with it keep your attention fixed on the lord 
what small temptations may lack in quality they more than make up it in quantity like small flies or gnats they buzz about our ears bite us on the nose or cheeks 
obscure our vision advice don waste time examining them simply brush them away or practice the opposite virtue word of caution small temptations can actually be 
more dangerous to our spiritual health in the long run precisely because they are so frequent and appear so insignificant people trying to grow in holiness may 
successfully resist great temptation only to be worn down and compromised by the multiple and insidious assaults of small ones 
all this talk of resisting temptations overlooks the other important insight of salesian spirituality temptations can

what small temptation may lack in quality they more than make up in quantity 

actually serve as reminders of our need for growth our need for good our need for god francis de sales tells us that the experience of temptation can bring us 
back to reality make us reflect
upon our frailty and cause us to have recourse more quickly to our creator 
when the voice of temptation speaks to you turn away the eyes of your mind cover the ears of your heart seek the love and strength of the god who created you who 
redeemed you who inspires you 
above all practice life of virtue there is no better remedy against temptation than to be otherwise occupied doing the work of the lord 
practice 
what is your understanding of perfection 
if you were perfect what would that look or feel like 
do you ever experience perfectionism 
which of the ways of being perfected in the salesian tradition are most attractive to you 
which one do you experience as most difficult 
which would be most helpful to you right now at this point in your life 

makes perfect 
be perfected as my heavenly father is perfect mt 48 
jesus calls each of us to be perfected that is to allow ourselves to be purified and transformed by the saving power of god love as well as to be sources of that 
saving power in the lives of our brothers and 
sisters in short we are to display in our own lives each in our own way the image and likeness of god in whose image we are created and in whose glory we are 
destined to share 
we need to be clear about what being perfected is as well as what it is 
not it is about the journey it is about cooperating with the grace of the holy spirit to allow the divine to permeate every sinew of our being it is about 
avoiding sin it is about practicing virtue it is about 
learning to be fully completely human in ways that give glory to god and give life to one another 
it is about living jesus 
it is not about perfectionism it is 
not about being without blemish it is not about living like angels it is not about destination 
salesian spirituality keeps perfection in perspective 
be realistic set goals for growing 
in perfection that are reasonable your imagination has formed an ideal of absolute perfection which is impossible to achieve francis de sales wrote to devout 
woman leaving you as it were heavy with child and 
unable to give birth to deeper level of the spiritual life 
use everyday means lofty paths are not always the most effective practice the ordinary virtues forbearance with others service to others humility gentleness of 
heart affability tolerance of our own 
imperfection and similar little virtues 
perfection requires that we name our imperfections dear imperfections francis de sales tells us they force us to acknowledge our misery give us practice in 
humility selflessness patience and watchfulness yet 
notwithstanding god looks at the honesty of our hearts and sees that it is perfect 
patience is the surest means of attaining perfection francis de sales claims 

be patient with everyone but above all with yourself 
mean don be disturbed about your imperfections and always have the courage to pick yourself up after fall 
be willing to begin as many times as it takes make fresh start each day there no better way of growing toward perfection in the spiritual life than to always be 
starting over again and never thinking that we 
have achieved it 
being perfected is not about being what think what should be no perfection is about knowing what god thinks should be and relying upon grace to make that happen 
according to god timetable not mine st jane de 
chantal admonishes us 

try to perform all your actions calmly and gently 
keep your mind ever joyful peaceful and content 

do not worry about your perfection or about your soul god to whom it is and to whom you should completely entrust it will take care of it and fill it with 
all the graces consolations and blessings of 
divine love in the measure that they will be useful in this life in the next life god will grant you eternal bliss 

keep being perfect in perspective it is about transformation in this life it is about glory in the next in short how do we become perfect it may be surprisingly 
similar to the advise given to folks who one day 
hope to make it big on broadway practice practice practice 
that right practice makes perfect 
 
readily frequently diligently 

how might the salesian notion of devotion be new to you 
what aspect of salesian devotion do your find the most attractive or encouraging 
what aspect of salesian devotion do you find the most confrontational or challenging 
where do you experience the most success in living devout life 
where do you experience the most difficulty or frustration in living devout life 
where do you go from here 

the practice of devotion

we are called to live devout life 
sounds lofty doesn it seems unrealistic doesn it maybe that because we don understand the true meaning of devotion 

true living devotion says st francis de sales is nothing else than the love of god 

inasmuch as divine love adorns the soul it is called grace inasmuch as it gives us the strength to do what is good it is called charity inasmuch as it not only 
makes us do what is good but helps us to do so 
diligently frequently and readily it is called devotion 
in short devotion is the habit of doing what is good in the eyes of god with as much diligence frequency and passion as possible simple straightforward and well 
within our reach 
with the help of god 

this devotion is not for chosen few it is meant for everyone to be practiced in ways appropriate to our particular walk state or stage of life st francis de 
sales maintains in the creation god commanded the 
plants to bring forth their fruits each one after its kind so does god command all christians who are living plants of the church to bring forth the fruits of 
devotion each according to one character and 
vocation 

devotion is about striving to integrate the two greatest commandments the love of god and the love of neighbor 

consideration of what devotion is not may be just as valuable person addicted to fasting may think himself very devout when he fasts though his heart at the same 
time is filled with rancor he scruples to 
moisten his tongue with wine or even with water because of his sobriety but he makes no difficulty of drinking deep of another blood by detraction and slander 
another person considers herself devout because 
she recites daily multiplicity of prayers although immediately afterwards she utters the most disagreeable arrogant and injurious words in her home and among her 
neighbors still another draws alms out of his 
purse to give to the poor but cannot draw meekness out of his heart to forgive his enemies people such as these are commonly perceived as devout while in fact 
they are not 

devotion is not something merely worn for others to admire many persons make the world think they are truly devout by covering themselves with certain external 
actions that are associated with devotion in 
truth these are nothing but images and phantoms of devotion 

authentic devotion is striving to integrate the internal and external authentic devotion is striving to integrate the love of god with the love of neighbor 

authentic devotion if you will is about talking the talk and walking the walk 

devotion is about being real st jane de chantal writes try to make your devotion generous noble straightforward and sincere try to foster this same spirit in 
those with whom you come in contact spirit founded 
upon deep humility which results in sincere obedience sweet charity which supports and excuses all and an innocent guileless simplicity that makes us even 
tempered and friendly toward everyone 

now that devotion worth practicing 
 
just kidding 
how often do you laugh every day 
do you usually laugh only at others foibles and mistakes or do you laugh at yourself as well 
are you able to bring humor into 
your spiritual life 
when you recognize your weaknesses and failings can you allow god to run the show 
can you see surrender to god as spiritual value in your life 
can you enjoy the fact that both you and your neighbors are simply fallible but loving human beings 

or is it 
sense of humor keen enough to show man his own absurdities as well as those of other people will keep him from the commission of all sins or nearly all samuel butler 
humor is an affirmation of dignity declaration of man superiority to all that befalls him romain gary 
he is not laughed at who laughs at himself first thomas fuller 
no man who has once heartily and wholly laughed can be altogether irreclaimably bad thomas carlyle 
the most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed chamfort 
humor in general and laughter in particular are not only healthy and fun but can actually promote healing perhaps that why the most popular section in reader 
digest continues to be laughter the best medicine 
st francis de sales in the 17th century was one of the first spiritual writers to recognize the great value of humor he saw it from special vantage point he 
reasoned that in order to become the best people 
that we can be we would have to get to know ourselves very well in order to know ourselves very well we would have to study and accept not only our good points 
but especially those aspects of our nature which 
are defective our failings our faults our shortcomings 
when we recognize our defects our imperfections we realize that we have only two options we can cry about them or we can laugh at them crying about them is fine 
but we have to go beyond that we have to get to 
the point that we actually love the fact that we make mistakes and do foolish and stupid things because then we can accept the fact that we are not in control of all that
humor simultaneously wounds and 
heals indicts and pardons diminishes and enlarges it constitutes inner growth at the expense of outer gain and those who possess and honestly practice it make 
themselves more through willingness to make themselves less louis kronenberger 
happens in our lives we have to accept the fact that god is in control and we then can move to discover his will and surrender to it 
st francis de sales would have us develop the holy virtue of eutrepelia this is name he borrowed from the greek it simply means laughing at ourselves but it is 
practiced in special way it is done by telling stories about ourselves to our friends and family members 
we all do dumb things some days we do quite few if we get overly upset about these mistakes it can lead to anxiety and insecurity if however we put it all into 
perspective we realize that we are not the 
perfect people we would always prefer to be and that we have to depend on god to get us through in telling these stories we also allow others to see how human we 
are we are not the totally in control people we 
sometimes appear to be we do not see ourselves as better than others and we don want to lord it over others this also encourages others to share the funny and 
sometimes stupid things they have said and done we can all laugh at our weaknesses and appreciate the same in 
despising mocking or scoffing at our neighbor is an exceedingly great sin francis de sales others it can be powerful way of being free of letting go 
however the practice of this charitable kidding can quickly become something far less noble when we aren feeling so good about ourselves in times like these we 
are tempted to point out others faults in 
sarcastic or vicious manner simply to make ourselves look better when this becomes the motive we have lost the value and simple joy of eutrepelia such laughter 
or humor is no longer medicinal rather it becomes something derisive and poisonous 
the ability to kid with ourselves and one another is like atomic energy it can be an instrument of healing it can also be source of great pain may god help us to 
use this power wisely

how do deal with life difficulties 
am angry or resentful do cling to hurts and disappointments long after should have let them go 
am half empty or half full person do avoid tough times in life at  the risk of also missing its joys 
what do need to learn at calvary at this point in my life what might need to bring to the cross of christ calvary 
life is difficult this is great truth one of the greatest truths it is great truth because once we truly accept this  truth we transcend it  once we truly know 
that life is difficult once we truly understand 
and accept it then life is no longer difficult because once it is accepted the fact that life is difficult no longer matters 
so says scott peck in his book the road less traveled so say all christians who reflect upon the image that sums up the life and love of christ 
calvary he embraced life and each person in it fully openly and jesus did not love to suffer jesus suffered because he loved honestly he did not avoid life some 
times complex challenging and messy nature jesus came to redeem all of creation not just the pleasant joyous and light hearted parts 
such is the world of relationships such is the world of life such is the world of love 
jesus had his share of heartache he experience rejection he experienced disappointment he experienced frustration he experienced humiliation he experienced loss 
ultimately he experienced death the temptation 
to avoid life challenges to turn away from opportunities for growth that can be found in grief to choose to withdraw from the world to choose to withdraw from 
oneself scott peck still jesus never allowed this 
dimension of life to obscure his vision of power and promise for all those who struggle to know and carry out even in the face of hardships the will of god each 
day 
as tough as life can be sometimes we only make things worse when we try to avoid life difficulties at any / all costs the truth is straightforward if we want to 
enjoy life roses we must we willing to accept our 
share of its thorns where do we learn to find opportunities for love even in the face of life painful realities francis points us to calvary the school of lovers 
all love that does not take its origin from the 
savior passion is foolish and perilous unhappy is death without the savior love unhappy is love without the savior death love and death are so mingled in the 
savior passion that we cannot have one in our hearts without the other 
this is not being maudlin this is being real and if true love is nothing else it must be real this world is all about the continuing confluence of success and 
surrender of embracing and letting go of life and death 
st jane de chantal encourages us to calm your passions and inclinations and live according to sound reason and the holy will of god otherwise will always be 
anxious and perturbed but if you are fortunate 
enough to accept the difficulties of this life which god sends to those he loves for their growth and progress toward blessedness then even in this life you will 
begin to get little taste of the delights of glorious eternity 
however we need to be sure that the calvary we embrace is that of christ not calvary of our own making we sometimes fashion crosses of our own when we fail to 
deal with life challenges in may god in all compassion grant us the grace to embrace life difficulties 
humble gentle patient and trusting manner such crosses are not means for salvation as much as sources for our own misery st jane once noted to member of her 
visitation community must you continue to be your 
own cross can see that no matter which way god leads you you change everything into bitterness and trouble brooding over everything 
be certain that the sufferings with which you bear are opportunities to follow god will as distinct from the sufferings that come from your attempts to push your 
will on god and others 

may god in all compassion grant us the grace to embrace the difficulties we sometimes encounter when we attempt to follow the will of god in so doing may we 
likewise experience something of the glory of god promised to all who enroll in the school of love win / win 

how often in my relationships do solve problems or make suggestions that set me up as winner and others as losers do see my neighbor as jesus 
do my attitudes towards others foster condescending attitude do empower others when enter joint ventures 
are cooperation mutuality interdependence and teamwork integral concept& in my working with and relating to other or am alone ranger  
consider upcoming projects consider some new ways of approaching them in ways that will bring people together and energize the organization community and group

stephen covey in his national bestseller seven habits of highly effective people reminds us that whether you are the president or the janitor the moment you step 
from independence in interdependence in any capacity you step into leadership role and the habit of effective leader ship is win / win 
the author suggests that this framework is not technique but way of 
most people tend to think in terms of the world divided into two groups winners and losers the haves and have nots 
life that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions 
for many in our contemporary culture this approach is an unrealistic philosophy to swallow most people tend to think in terms of the world divided into two 
groups winners and losers the haves and the have nots 
recent slogan discovered on bumper sticker brought this home loud and clear if you can run with the big dogs you better stay on the porch as far back as cain and 
abel it seems as if humankind has had to translate relationships in terms of the accepted and rejected winners and losers 
the spiritual journey is not exempt 
from the struggle one doesn have to look any further than the occupants around the passover table on the night that jesus gave himself to his followers as the 
bread of life and the cup of salvation  before 
they were rudely interrupted by the lord the apostles were arguing about who should be regarded as the greatest 
stephen covey is right when he tells us that the win / lose approach to be fair in all your actions always put yourself in your neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours 
life is seriously flawed in fact four centuries earlier another keenly perceptive gentleman counseled be fair in all your actions always put yourself in your 
neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours then 
you will judge fairly imagine yourself the seller when buying and the buyer when selling then you will buy and sell fairly 

the author of this sentiment saint francis de sales reminds us in his spiritual approach to life that we must draw one another attention to the fact that each of 
us is made in god image and likeness and the 
measure of our love for god rests in the perfection of our love for our neighbor 
some believe that everything outside of their self interest doesn matter the contrary is true anything less than striving for goals that benefit all is settling 
for second best as best in world that is growing 
intensely interdependent in an environment where we profess to be children of the same god win / win is the only viable option covey notes that in relationships 
like marriage for instance if both are people aren winning then both are 
francis de sales cautions that an individual is never do dead as when he or she lives for self alone 
losing in the same vein francis de sales cautions that an individual is never so dead as when he or she lives for self alone 
paul john has challenged us in his writings on solidarity to embrace an attitude that fosters firm and enduring determination to commit oneself to the common 
good because we truly are responsible for one 
another he challenges us in real sense to win / win approach to life and relationships jesus died in order that we might win all of us for heaven let do our level 
best to make that promise reality heart 

what is my understanding of humility is it healthy or harmful 
am truly gentle with myself 
am truly gentle with others 
am willing to put myself in another shoes 
how generous am in my dealings with others 
am tough on others but lax on myself 
what is my notion of being just person 
are there areas in my life in which need to seek justice for myself or others 

for justice 
st francis de sales is best known for the practice of two virtues humility and gentleness 
humility might be described as 
living in the truth the truth is that we are created in god image and likeness the trust is that we are good the truth is that we do not always live up to that 
goodness the truth is that we need god 
forgiveness and grace to make that goodness real the truth is that we need the support and encouragement of one another 
gentleness might be described as the practice of proportionality it is about keeping things in perspective it is 
about knowing when to stand firm it is about knowing when to give ground 
most of all whether in good times tough times or in all the times in between gentleness is about relating to ourselves and others with profound respect 
graciousness rooted in the recognition that each of us all of us are sons and daughters of the living god 
in short being humble and gentle is about trying to embody the words of jesus found in st matthew gospel come to me all you who are weary and find life 
burdensome and will refresh you learn from me for am gentle and humble of heart 
the daily practice of these two virtues fashions particular kind of heart in those who follow jesus heart that longs and strives for justice 
be just and equitable in all your actions wrote st francis de sales in part three chapter 36 of the introduction to the devout life 
always put yourself in your neighbor place and put your neighbor in yours and then you will judge rightly 

he continued imagine yourself the seller when you are buying imagine yourself the buyer when you are selling in this way you will sell and buy according to 
justice 
this is not always easy to do we are frequently tempted to relate to others in ways that are not just that are not reasonable we are tempted to promote only our 
own concerns to first ask what in it for me or to always be concerned about taking care of number one 
at times like these we have two hearts one heart is mild favorable and courteous toward ourselves the other is hard severe and rigorous toward our neighbor at 
times like these we have two balances the one to 
weigh out conveniences to our own greatest advantages and the other to weigh those of our neighbor to their greatest possible disadvantage 
humble gentle people frequently check to see if they relate to others reasonably humble gentle people frequently check to see if their hearts truly strive for justice 
st francis de sales challenges us do not neglect to frequently examine whether your heart be such with respect to your neighbor as you would desire your neighbor 
to be with respect to you were you in the other situation such an ordinary thing such and walk humbly relate gently live justly love generously 
everyday thing in the salesian tradition such powerful life giving thing in the end claims st francis de sales we lose nothing by living generously nobly 
courteously and with royal just and reasonable heart 
not only do we lose nothing but in the eyes of god we gain everything place in god heart forever in heaven place in god plan for salvation now here on earth 
walk humbly relate gently live justly love generously in ways great and small strive to follow the example of the gentleman saint follower of christ who 
challenges us embody the heart of jesus to embody the heart of justice sense of civility 

how do deal with conflict in my life 
do fight fair when confronted with disagreements grace builds on nature do treat others in polite civil manner 
life seldom provides big opportunities to respect others do make use of the countless opportunities to practice simple ordinary acts of kindness every day 
in what area of my life could use the healing touch of civility from others 

salesian hallmark 
scott peck claims something is seriously wrong with our society in his book entitled world waiting to be born bantam 1993 the author identifies what he believes 
is corrosive cancer that threatens our families 
schools workplaces communities and social institutions an epidemic of incivility 
it seems that wherever we look people are locked in combat whether in rancorous debate on the floor of the house of representatives rush hour obscenities 
exchanged in traffic the rise of teenage violence or 
the antics of daytime television we appear to be losing the ability to treat one another in civil manner 
courtesy politeness and respect are retreating to take no prisoners approach to personal familial or political competition and conflict 
what is the remedy to this state of affairs first we need to constantly remind ourselves that god created us out of love second we need to constantly remember 
that every person we encounter possesses god given 
dignity and worth third we need to demonstrate these truths by treating one another in respectful civil manner st francis de sales 1567 1622 is model of civility 
although he witnessed and experienced 
tremendous turmoil during his lifetime he is celebrated for his unwavering attempts to treat others with profound respect good manners and kind demeanor even in 
the midst of conflict this quality later earned 
him the title of the gentleman saint whose feast day is observed on january 24 
he believed that jesus command to love one another is most frequently demonstrated by our practice of civility 
he believed that jesus command to love one another is most frequently demonstrated by the practice of civility relating to our parents spouses children co 
workers friends even enemies in just and hospitable manner 
st francis de sales advice for promoting civility in families schools communities and social structures is just as powerful and practical in our own day as it 
was nearly 400 years ago the single best source 
for his down to earth wisdom can be found in his introduction to the devout life first published in 1608 just sampling of his guidance and encouragement include 
while it is important to resist evil and address the faults of others we must do so gently and peacefully 
when you encounter difficulties and contradictions do not try to break them rather bend them with gentleness and time 
you can attract more flies with teaspoon of honey than with barrel of vinegar 
  
the roots for civility means members of household  we are members of the household of god citizens with the saints who are called to live jesus to build the city 
of god here on earth even as we our commitment to relate with
one another in respectful just and loving ways can be powerful remedy indeed for world increasingly threatened by hostility rancor and violence 
  
anticipate our everlasting home in heaven 
our commitment to relate with one another in respectful just and loving ways can be powerful remedy indeed for world increasingly threatened by hostility rancor 
and violence blessed are we to have st francis 
de sales as our companion and guide as we attempt to walk on the way with our brothers and sisters gently peacefully and amiably each and every day 
may god help us to recognize that civility is one of the strongest foundations for the practice of charity hearing god word 

is my mind so distracted that have difficulty in remaining attentive to the word of god 
what impact does the word of god  have in my life how well do prepare to receive the word of god 
what are some ways that can take the message to serve and love the lord have taken the good news to others 
where am most in need of the healing power of god word in my life at this time 

and keeping it 

blessed are those who hear the word of god and observe it luke 11 28 
we hold up the lectionary of biblical texts in the procession that opens the celebration of the eucharist incense it before reading it on solemn occasions and 
preface the gospel reading with an ‘alleluia this 
is no ordinary book indeed all these words and actions indicate what respect we have for the text and what hopes we have from reading and interpreting it writes 
lawrence cunningham much has happened to scripture reading since the l7th century of st 
francis de sales the thirst for christian direction through prayerful scripture study listening and sharing by laymen and women is norm of the 21st century the 
bible library of books is god word in unique way 
that is not true of any other human composition the second vatican council states that the church serves the word of god and pays reverence to it 
it is most interesting to read the words of st francis de sales some four hundred years ago concerning scripture 
be devoted to the word of god whether you hear it in familiar conversations with spiritual friends or sermons always listen to it with attention and reverence 
make good use of it do not let it fall to earth but take it into your heart 
we must prepare ourselves to hear the word with the attention it deserves not as it if were just any other word 
we must open our hearts in the presence of the divine majesty receptive to his heavenly dew 
when we hear the word of god in preaching or when we read it in book 
let us spiritually place it on our heads in obedience let us submit ourselves to the things that are taught us concerning god will for our perfection and 
spiritual advancement 
receive the word in spirit of humility devotion and reverence hear it with attention 
his message emphasizes preparation and action when we hear the word of god how do we do this reverence to listen with trust is to
accept the father word the scriptures are not so much source of information as word that demands response the bible is not read to satisfy curiosity but to 
uncover call from god and requires our response if we 
accept it it changes us outright rejection results in what st jerome said ignorance of scripture is ignorance of god 

preparation begin by studying sunday scripture readings our church has blessed us with structured cycle system that provides an opportunity to read over eighty 
percent of the bible use it prepare to hear the expected and unexpected   

attentiveness concentrate on really hearing the word to listen is to be alert to what the spirit is saying to the world today limit distractions by being prepared 

we each bring to the mass variety of experiences and perspectives concerning the scripture reading st francis de sales would want us to strive to be serious 
christians who take the inexhaustible richness of 
the word seriously reverently and apply it to our lives in spirit of devotion and attention he suggests that we hear and understand the scripture truths the same 
as we seek perfection in all our spiritual practices 

be kind to yourself as you struggle with finding the time or place for preparation remember the presence of god is in the word remember the presence and action 
of the word in all creation remember most of all our call to be god word in the lives of one another 
 
decisions decisions 

discernment must lead to choice to action do your choices 
help you to practice virtue 
enable you to be faithful to your state or stage in life 
increase your sense of peace 
deepen your experience of joy 
enrich the lives of others 
respect the needs of others 
make you better listener 
help you to do what is good right and just in the eyes of god 

discerning the will of god what does god want me to do 
this question simply put is at the heart of discernment this question is also at the heart of the salesian tradition discernment presumes at least four things 
god exists 
god is near to me 
god has will or desire for me 
can come to know god will 
the salesian tradition describes discernment as the experience of living between the two wills of god 
god signified will is that which god is communicating in general through the commandments and counsels found in scripture the authority and teaching of the 
church the lived experience and tradition of the 
christian faithful the inspiration of the spirit the duties of one state or vocation in life 
for example if you are married and raising family god signified will for you would include such things as living life of virtue honoring your father and mother 
keeping the holy the sabbath believing that 
christ is truly present in the eucharist nourishing your relationship with your spouse raising your children in the faith being good parent 
god signified will in particular may also be expressed through the actual circumstances in life over which you have no control you are on your way to an 
important meeting and you get flat tire you are 
preparing to leave work when co worker needs your help you are watching tv and your child asks you to review homework assignment all of these invite you to ask 
what is really important here 
god permissive will involves those things over which you do have control or influence is today the day you confront co worker about an earlier dispute do you 
accept or decline that promotion what do your 
children need from you at this moment should you put your parent in nursing home 
where is your relationship with your spouse most in need of attention should you make time to perform volunteer work how should you invest your money 
discernment is the process of being open to how god permissive will is inviting you to live out god signified will in ways that are appropriate ~ and even 
required by the circumstances relationships and events 
in which you find yourself 
put another way discernment is about choosing how best to follow
god will desires and longings for you now today this moment what is the best or what are some better ways of imitating the example of christ in this particular 
moment circumstance or event no matter how 
serious or commonplace 
how do you know what is better or best 
develop the ability to listen develop the ability to filter out the external and internal static of your life recognize that the most pressing things are not 
always the most important realize too that the most 
important things must sometimes wait for the most pressing 
focus on how god may be speaking through your family friends or co workers pay attention to the demands and responsibilities of your state and stage in life both 
the planned and the unexpected personal prayer 
the reading of scripture celebrating the eucharist employing the assistance of spiritual director and experiencing the sacrament of reconciliation can help you 
to sharpen your hearing 
discernment never occurs in vacuum it always takes place within the context of your relationships with god yourself others and the created order in which you 
live turn to trusted friends who can support your 
attempts to do what is right in the eyes of god 
turn to your personal history too learn from past successes learn from past mistakes 
above all regardless of the ease or difficulty with which you discern god will place your confidence and trust in god presence even when you can see hear or feel 
god voice the
spirit is with you 
ask god for the grace and courage to discern wisely every day

divine providence

am aware of god presence in my life at this very moment 
in what ways do see god love manifest in family friends and community 
can recognize that peaceful response to the changes of life encourages more growth 
can hear the voice of god in the words of friends 
how well do relate to the words of the our father 
does this prayer help me to recognize my need for nourishment forgiveness and protection from evil 

and god loving care
do not think about what will happen tomorrow for the same eternal father who takes care of you today will look out for you tomorrow and always thus st francis de sales admonishes us with typically reassuring 
words to trust in divine providence at precisely the point where it most directly touches our lives the present 
de sales presents this constant care of the lord as it truly is real contact between god ever present care arid our daily lives 
st jane de chantal observes 
herein lies our excellence to see the loving will of god in all things and to follow it salesian spirituality challenges us to see taste and hear this di vine providence precisely where we are 
recent books on prayer have centered on listening to god but most of us find it difficult to hear the message this is because the source of the answer may be the words or actions of friend or colleague 
let us consider more directly some of the varied ways in which st francis de sales drives home the message of the real presence of god love in his perpetual care for each of us 
one way of doing this may be by recognizing the opportunity others present for our recognition of his message for us live entirely for god and since you have to take part in conversations and 
social gatherings are a mess 
try to be of some use to others it is precisely in these gatherings that moments of care trust and compassion can elevate ordinary experiences   
second recognize the father love in ordinary events so too if you gather and manage the goods of this world with one hand you must always hold fast to your heavenly father hand with the other 

when we cooperate with god will our lives become more not less free 

third trust in god care be at peace since you are one of god children and let your restless weary heart rest against the sacred loving breast of the savior who by his gentle tender love is mother to them this 
loving father / mother is the very description of unconditional love so vital to healthy personality 
fourth stay centered don let anxiety take control of your heart you have passed through number of trials by the grace of god the same grace will be there for you in all the occasions to 
come most therapists make a mess 
rely on just such advice to assist clients to work through problems using the skills of experience 

st jane de chantal offers beautiful image for being open to divine providence we should keep ourselves in the good hands of this great god like cloth in the hands of tailor who cuts it in hundred different 
ways for use as the tailor pleases and designs 

how much more so does providence provide for navigating rough paths 

so too we should allow the powerful hand of god to cut hammer and chisel us just as divine providence wishes so as to make us fitting stone for the adornment of god edifice which is life and love 

if we were to forget all of these things francis advises in his letters keep this maxim in mind god is our father because if he were not jesus would not have commanded us to say our father what have you to 
fear if you are children of such father without whose providence not even one hair of our head would fall 
 
reasoned not rash
how do perceive other people 
am reasonable in my judgments 
what are the circumstances in which am tempted to judge rashly 
are there particular people in my life at home in the neighborhood or on the job whom am more inclined to judge rashly than others who are they why do judge them this way 
what might my experience of rash judgment tell me about the condition of my own mind heart or soul 
what steps can take to reduce my tendency or temptation to judge others rashly 
how might need to judge more reasonably

judging one another
have you ever made snap judgment about someone else have you ever gone with first impression about someone else and never move beyond it have you ever spent 
great deal of time imagining or even obsessing about 
someone else motives have you ever found yourself presuming the worst about someone else 
if you have done one or more you may have been guilty of rash judgment 
st francis de sales has pretty low tolerance for the practice of judging others rashly in his introduction to the devout life he wrote how offensive to god is 
rash judgment it is kind of spiritual jaundice 
that causes all things to appear evil to the eyes of those people infected with it rash judgment begets uneasiness contempt of neighbor pride self satisfaction 
and many other extremely bad effects 
why do we judge others rashly francis believed that people who have drunk in pride envy ambition and hatred think that everything they see is evil and 
reprehensible 
francis suggests that there are number of interior qualities that tempt us to judge others rashly naturally sour or negative personality arrogant or presumptuous 
attitudes trying to make oneself feel better at the expense of others desire to flatter and excuse oneself by finding someone else who appears worse an attempt 
to make oneself seem more intelligent or together strong personal dislike jealousy fear ambition and other mental weaknesses 
what is the ultimate goal of rash judgment 
to draw conclusion from an action in order to condemn the other person 
god judgment is so different from ours wrote st jane de chantal god never judges rashly god judgments are fair clear patient and long suffering god judges not 
with an eye to condemn but with the hope of calling us back of making us whole of setting us right of offering us the power of reconciliation of extending to us 
the promise of eternal life and love 
god judgments are not rooted in suspicion or speculation god judgments are rooted in the truth 
what steps can we take to cure ourselves of the disease of rash judgment whoever wants to be cured must apply remedies not to the eyes or intellect but to the 
affections drink as deeply as you can of the sacred wine of charity wrote francis de sales charity will set you free from the perverse moods that cause you to 
make such tortured judgments since charity is fearful of meeting evil charity never looks for evil 
he continued imagine yourself the seller when you are buying imagine yourself the buyer when you are selling in this way you will sell and buy according to 
justice 
does this mean we should be blind to the actual evil sins or imperfections that may exist in others no   it is permissible to doubt or suspect in the strict 
sense and as far as proof and arguments compel us to do so 

the key is to address any actual or perceived issues or conflicts as simply and quickly as possible and then move on learn and let go rather than brood over or 
harbor them in our hearts 

to be like god to live like jesus to love like the spirit we must judge one another in ways that are reasonable and righteous base judgment on fact not fiction 
in sensitivity not suspicion on behavior not bias in faith not fear 

francis de sales wrote if your affections are kind your judgments will be likewise 
what do our judgments of others say about the condition of our hearts 
 
anxious 
what are the things the people the situations in my life about which am anxious 
what is the good for which hope what are the difficulties about which fear 
how do my anxieties manifest themselves 
what are some practical concrete  steps can take to reduce my anxieties 
what are some practical concrete  steps can take to achieve good or to deal with my difficulties 
do pray to god about the source of my anxiety and mess 
is there someone friend colleague professional with whom can process the source of my anxiety 
once ve done all that can how good am at letting go 

don't be 
have you ever worried about the future the destiny of son or daughter outliving your retirement investments or caring for an aging disabled parent have you ever 
worried about the past regretted decisions 
broken relationships or unfulfilled dreams 
have you ever had the experience of being worried about everything in general but nothing in particular 
if you said yes then you know what it means to be anxious 
 with the exception of sin anxiety is the greatest evil that can befall us 
to be sure there are many things in our lives that cause us to be anxious regrets about the past uncertainties about the future and everything in between but 
anxiety can be as bad or sometimes even worse than 
the things about which we were worried in the first place the american heritage dictionary of the english language houghton mifflin 1992 defines anxiety as state 
of intense apprehension uncertainty and fear 
resulting from threatening situation or event often to degree that the normal physical and psychological functioning of the affected individual is disrupted 
st francis de sales certainly knew the danger of anxiety in his introduction to the devout life 1609 he wrote anxiety is the greatest evil that can befall us sin 
excepted strong language he continued sedition 
and internal troubles ruin nation utterly and prevent it from being able to resist foreign invasion similarly when we are troubled and restless we lose our power 
to maintain the virtue that we have acquired we 
also lose the means of resisting the temptations of the enemy who then makes every effort to fish as they say in troubled waters 
anxiety not only hinders us from resisting evil it can also prevent us from achieving what is good 
how many first dates interviews for job promotion or efforts to win that big contract have gone up in smoke because of anxiety st francis de sales wrote 
anxiety arises from an inordinate desire to be freed from the evil we experience or to acquire the good for which we hope yet there is nothing which so 
aggravates the evil or impedes the good as anxiety and 
eager ness 
anxiety inordinate desire –is truly two edged sword  since it is so much apart of
life how do we deal with it st jane de chantal was contemporary and friend of st francis de sales in her advice to woman who had recently been widowed st jane 
offered her remedy for anxiety try to calm your 
passions and inclinations and live according to the sound reason and the holy will of god otherwise you will always be anxious and perturbed 
st francis de sales wrote when you are taken up by desire to be delivered from some evil or to obtain some good place yourself above all in peace and tranquility 
compose your judgment and your will then quietly and gently pursue the object of your desire taking in order the means that are fitting and when say gently do 
not mean negligently but without eagerness 
confusion and anxiety other wise you will spoil every thing 
so when faced with some sin or setback to avoid or when striving to obtain some gift or good remain calm ask god for the presence of mind and heart to stay 
centered no matter how small or great the temptation 
to be anxious consider what god gives you the courage and ability to do on your own behalf consider too that which only god can accomplish 
perhaps st jane says it best what mean is that in all your good works you should unite yourself to the will of god good pleasure in all in your faults and 
imperfections you should unite yourself to god 
compassion gently quietly and with peace of mind 
half empty 

what are my fundamental beliefs about god 
what are my fundamental beliefs about others 
what are my fundamental beliefs about myself 
am half full or half empty person 
do focus on failure or do gravitate toward growth 
do see more of what is wrong in life or what is right 
what experiences in my past have brought me to this point in my present 
how might need to experience healing or grow in my practice of hope 
or half full 
am an optimist or pessimist is life generally pleasant for me or painful am basically happy or sad is the glass half full or is the glass half empty 
our answers to these questions and to others like them are important our fundamental beliefs and attitudes have tremendous impact on how we perceive life when we 
view life positively we tend to focus on what 
is right or good when we view life negatively we tend to focus on what is wrong or evil 
on any given day we usually see only what we choose to believe 
knowing whether we are half empty or half full people isn merely some exercise in rhetorical speculation no far from it ultimately such knowledge is matter of 
life and death 
our fundamental beliefs and attitudes have tremendous impact on how we perceive life 
volumes of research clearly indicate that people who are basically optimistic are much more effective and successful in dealing with the realities and challenges 
of life joyful painful and everything else in 
between than those people whose attitudes are basically pessimistic 
this is true in every dimension of life physical psychological emotional 
social and spiritual 
what does it mean to be an optimistic or half full person the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines optimism as tendency to expect the 
best possible outcome or dwell on the most helpful aspects of situation is your life a mess
francis de sales was clearly half full person in considering whether human beings are basically good or basically evil for example francis de sales had this to 
say consider the nature god has given us 
 as the cross of calvary starkly demonstrates sometimes being optimistic isn enough 
it is the highest in this visible world it is capable of eternal life and of being perfectly united to god divine majesty introduction to the devout life part 
one chapter the gentleman saint was not naive as 
thomas green cites in his book come down zacchaeus francis de sales recognized the tragedy of sin he acknowledged the allure of temptation he knew the 
experiences of suffering pain loss and injustice he saw 
the possibility of human fear and blindness that is why as green observed francis stressed the importance of good guide and of well balanced program of spiritual 
discipline 64 but more importantly francis 
proclaimed the greater truth of god creative power the greater reality of god redeeming love the greater possibility of god inspiring hope thomas green wrote god 
is truly here for those who have eyes to see 
for god everything is possible this is the faith foundation of the good sense and joyous hope so prominent in francis de sales ibid francis de sales certainly 
dwells on the most helpful aspects of the situation that we call life doesn he 
however as the cross of calvary starkly demonstrates sometimes optimism isn enough we need something deeper something more fundamental and something more 
enduring mess being optimistic is not the same as  being naive 
half full / god filled people need hope perhaps the best definition of this virtue comes from vaclav ravel who while imprisoned in czech prison wrote hope is 
definitely not the same thing as optimism it is not 
the conviction that something will turn out well rather hope is the certainty that comes from the belief that things make sense that life is full of purpose 
regardless of the results 
half empty or half full devoid of meaning or full of purpose dragged down by what is wrong or encouraged by what is right

the virtue of hope 
what are the things for which you hope world peace promotion at work  the lottery jackpot good health secure retirement an end to violence cure for cancer 
what do we do when we hope what does it really mean when we hope for something 
the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines hope as to wish for something with the expectation of fulfillment it defines the theological virtue of hope as 
the desire and search for future good difficult but not impossible to attain with god help 
from theological point of view there is much more to hope than mere wishful thinking  
in the opinion of st francis de sales we cannot fully understand the virtue of hope without also understanding the practice of aspiration 
in book two of his treatise on the love of god francis de sales distinguishes one from the other we hope for those things that we expect to gain through the aid of another whereas we aspire to those things 
that we expect to gain through our own resources and our own efforts chapter 17 
put different way we hope when we rely on others efforts for good things whereas we aspire when we rely on our own efforts simple example might be helpful to understand the relationship between hope and 
aspiration and how we need to practice both in order to attain the good things for which we desire 
we cannot fully understand hope without understanding aspiration 
my sister has son in first grade she desires as would any parent that each and every day of school is safe healthy and positive experience for him she aspires when she wakes him up in the morning she aspires 
when she helps him to get dressed she aspires when she makes him breakfast she aspires when she checks his backpack she aspires when she walks him to the bus stop she aspires when 
she gives him kiss and watches him board the bus she aspires as she waves goodbye mess 
as the bus pulls away my sister hopes she hopes that the driver completes the trip safely she hopes that her son teachers will do their very best she hopes that her son classmates will treat him with kindness 
and respect she hopes that her son does the same for others she hopes that the return bus trip will be as safe as the morning she hopes that her son remembers to bring home what he needs to prepare for tomorrow 
she aspires when she is there to greet the bus she aspires as she walks him home she aspires as she listens to him talk about all the wonderful things that happened that day in school she aspires as she cares 
for him during what remains of this day she hopes for another good day tomorrow 
of the relationship between these two practices francis wrote just as those who would try to hope without aspiring are cowardly and irresponsible so too those who try to aspire 
without hoping are rash insolent and presumptuous ibid mess 
as people of faith we hope when we know that the good things for which we wish depend on the grace of god and the good will of others as people of faith we aspire when we 
recognize that the good things for which we wish also depend on our own efforts 
 wisdom consists in knowing when to hope and when to aspire 
as people of faith wisdom consists of knowing when and how to hope when and how to aspire 
wish to win the lottery be sure to buy ticket wish for secure retirement be sure to plan now wish for good health be sure to see doctor regularly wish for world peace be sure to begin at home as for the 
outcome as people of faith we know that after we have aspired in our own regard and hoped with regard to others we must leave the ultimate results in the hands of god who loves us always poor in spirit 

on scale of one to ten how poor in spirit am do anxiously long or obsess about things that do not possess 
am inordinately concerned about losing the things that already do possess 
how do handle good fortune do keep it for myself or do share it with others 
on scale of one to ten how generous am in my dealings with others do trust god do trust others 
in what ways do need to better practice poverty of spirit 

rich in mind and heart 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes the first of which is blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs 
is the kingdom of god 
the placement of this beatitude before all others underscores the importance of the question what does it mean to be poor in spirit 
francis de sales offered this reflection on this first of the beatitudes in his introduction to the devout life 
whatever riches and all other transitory things you may possess you must keep your heart free from the slightest affection for them 
your heart may be surrounded by riches however riches must never master your heart 
the gentleman saint offers this practical image to explain this virtue there is difference between possessing poison and being poisoned pharmacists keep almost every kind of poison in stock for use in various 
situations yet they are not themselves poisoned because the poison is merely in their shops not in their bodies so too you can possess riches without being poisoned by them if you keep them in
your home your purse or your wallet but not in your heart 
failing to live spirit of poverty is like having fever francis suggested 
we can be sure that we are indeed suffering from this fever when we lovingly ardently and anxiously desire to possess goods that we do not have and when we are strongly attached to the goods that we already 
possess when we set our hearts on them always having them in our thoughts and fear losing them with strong anxious fear 
consider the parable of the rich fool in the gospel of luke 12 13 21 rich man with bumper crop has problem his barns cannot accommodate the yield his solution he plans to tear down his barns and build bigger 
ones that will hold all of his good fortune 
of course the only thing that surpasses this man wealth so goes the parable is his foolishness god takes his life that very night 
the rich man is not condemned because he had filled his barns with riches 
he is condemned because he had filled his heart with his riches he was so consumed and self absorbed with his good fortune that when he was trying to decide how to dispose of it he never considered simpler and 
more virtuous option to share it with others francis de sales puts it this way willingly grant that you may take care to increase your wealth and resources provided this is done not only justly but properly 
and charitably 
what does poverty of spirit look like francis offers this advice do not have full and explicit desire for wealth you do not have 

only increase your wealth justly properly and charitably 

do not set your heart deeply on what you already possess don grieve long over losses you incur then you will have some grounds to believe that although you may be rich in effect you are not such in affection 
poor and consequently blessed will you be because your greatest possession is the kingdom of god 

word to the wealthy and the wise the best way to avoid being anxious about getting what you want or losing what you have is to be generous to others therein lies the secret of the poor in spirit pursuing 
richness of mind and heart wealth that in the eyes of god enriches now and forever in the kingdom of god 
prayer 
am attentive to god invitation to pray throughout the day 
what do find are the best times for me to pray 
how do pray while am doing household tasks cleaning doing the laundry preparing meal 
what is the greatest challenge to prayer in the work environment time atmosphere stress what can do to meet these challenges of supplies 
what are some things that can do that will help me to seize every opportunity to pray 
for busy people 
with all prayer and supplication pray at 
every opportunity in the spirit eph 18 
prayer is the heart of our personal relationship with our god god continuous invitation of love to each of us which allows us to respond in prayer is an unfathomable gift given to us moment by moment 
many of us desire to grow into deeper loving relationship with god the question is how to integrate daily prayer into our busy often hectic schedules what does our salesian tradition say about praying at every 
opportunity 
they who wish to thrive and advance in the way of our lord should at the beginning of their actions both interior and exterior ask for his grace spiritual directory of st francis de sales 23 
an essential element in our daily prayer life is the awareness of god presence with us 
because we can easily get caught up in the nitty gritty of the day francis de sales recommends that as soon as we awaken we unite ourselves with god in loving praise and gratitude and offer to him in advance 
all that this new day may bring the opportunities for doing good as well as the difficulties which we may encounter feel rushed in the morning some practical suggestions from our salesian lay group that meets 
once week set your alarm few minutes early and take advantage of your special time with god until the snooze alarm arouses you once again use your shower time to talk with god or to sing songs of praise if you 
re mental organizer place god in your plans for the day as you are getting dressed 
make spiritual aspirations to god by short ardent movements of your heart present your soul to him thousand times during the day introduction to the devout life ryan 98 francis de sales urges us to reinforce 
this direction of intention throughout the day with short aspirations or prayers that lift our hearts to god if you drive to work reflect on the words of the psalmist for yourself and all those on the road the 
lord will guard your coming and going both now and forever ps 
121 take time too to notice the beauties of nature let your heart echo spontaneous prayers of thanksgiving to god for the mountains and hills rivers and streams of water birds and trees and flowers let all the 
earth cry out to the lord with joy try playing tapes in the car of praise music or of salesian topics available from the oblates of francis de sales as in all things our salesian saints would encourage us to 
use liberty of spirit 
once engaged in the work of the day at home or in business environment continue to lift your heart to god by the use of short prayers oh jesus am yours draw fie and will run holy spirit guide my work 
have point of focus which will refresh you periodically during the day picture in the corner of your desk or room or small cross in your pocket for those who work at the computer let me pass on suggestion that 
have found helpful to remind me of god presence during my work set the alarm of the computer so that it flashes the name of jesus on the screen at periodic intervals every 45 minutes or an hour and if you have 
break during lunch there are multiple web sites containing prayers or suggestions for reflection two of my favorites are sacred space the prayer site run by the irish jesuits and awaken to prayer how to pray 
as catholic 
finally francis urges us to make the time each day for quiet meditation or contemplation simply listening to god in the depths of our hearts setting aside the time each day requires discipline and commitment 
initially spending 10 15 minutes alone with god is wonderful practice 
reflecting on particular gospel passage saying familiar vocal prayers or allowing yourself to listen quietly to god in an attitude of openness and surrender are all ways suggested by our salesian saints 
perhaps st jane de chantal advice succinctly summarizes the best approach to all prayer 

draw near to god with the greatest simplicity you can and be certain that the simplest prayer is the best exhortations conferences and instructions

how do experience the gospel as good news at this point in my life in what ways 
do believe that am called to share the good news of jesus with others 
are there ways in which resist or shy away from sharing the good news of jesus with others 
how can evangelize at home at work in school with neighbors with friends 
how do need to be transformed by the good news of god love for me 
share all about it 
jesus appeared to the eleven as they were eating he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen jesus said to them go into all the world 
and preach the good news to all creation mark 16 14 15 
these are jesus parting words to his closest friends these are jesus parting words to those with whom he entrusted his message of salvation and redemption  what was jesus saying to them what is jesus saying to 
us when we consider the mandate to go into the world and preach the good news to all creation we are speaking of evangelization in on evangelization in the modern world pope paul vi says that evangelization 
means bringing the good news into all strata of humanity and through its influence transforming humanity from within and making it new 
reflecting on pope paul vi definition paulist fathers frank desiano csp and kenneth boyack csp write 
if evangelization is the transformation of human nature by the proclamation of 
the good news if it is directed toward individuals and toward societies if it is dealing with particular lives and whole environments it would seem to cover just about everything   the evangelizing
parish page 25 supply 
we sometimes refuse to believe that we have role to play in sharing christ good news with others 
sharing the good news of salvation and redemption ultimately involves everything evangelization ultimately involves everyone 
like the eleven sometimes we stubbornly refuse to believe that each of us has role to play in god plan of salvation we stubbornly believe that sharing the good news is only for special few we stubbornly 
believe that evangelization is for priests nuns brothers and missionaries or for others who make it fulltime job in obscure corners of the world 
each and everyone of us is called to share the good news of jesus however the ways in which we evangelize must fit the state and stage of life in which we find ourselves in other words while all of us are 
called to evangelize each of us must do it in ways particular to our circumstances responsibilities and relationships 
in the salesian tradition evangelization is really about the practice of devotion transforming our own thoughts feelings attitudes and actions with the love of god for most of us evangelization is less about 
preaching and more about being perfected it does no harm whatsoever but instead perfects all things so every vocation becomes more agreeable care of one family love of husband or wife service to others and 
every type of employment introduction to the devout ~ book one chapter 
simply put evangelization is not about bringing god to place or to people where god is not already present no sharing the good news is reminding ourselves and others in word in attitude in actions of god who 
is always present francis de sales tells us not only is god in the place where you are but also in your heart in the very center of your spirit supplies 

sharing the good news is about reminding ourselves of god who is always present 

evangelization is about living in the truth that god is always calling us to be more of who and how god created us to be the truth is that christ redeeming love has opened up the world of love to us the truth 
is that the spirit dwells within us and among us to transform us helping us to make real on earth something of the justice and peace the community and the communion of god kingdom 

that very good news how can we own it and share it today 
 
alone 
to what degree am lone ranger 
in what ways am reluctant to work  with other people why 
in what ways am willing and able to work with others why 
what positive dimensions of collaboration have experienced when with whom what lessons might draw from these experiences 
what negative dimensions of collaboration have experienced when with whom what lessons might draw from these experiences 
how well do trust god myself and other people 

or with others 
it is not good that the man should 
be alone genesis 18 it not good for us either we are made to love we are made to be in relationship we are made to work play pray speak and listen together 
working playing and praying together requires trust it requires that we be open to who others really are it requires that we open who we really are to others it requires that we are willing to risk to succeed 
and even fail 
we are talking about collaboration 
collaboration is defined as mutual approach shared approach of identifying releasing and uniting the gifts of 
all baptized persons   collaborative 
ministry 
seen through the eyes of salesian spirituality collaboration might be described as living jesus 
collaboration seems best suited for living in satisfying successful and sanctifying way of life to work together in helping to surface our own gifts and the gifts of others to help create world that more 
clearly reflects something of the saving power and promise of the kingdom of god 
there are five assumptions that provide foundation for living life in collaborative manner to share life with one another first god is the source of all gifts second all persons are gifted third all gifts are 
intended to help people achieve spiritual growth and integrity fourth these same gifts must help us to support others to achieve spiritual growth and integrity fifth it is about being open to and aware of the 
power and inspiration of the holy spirit in myself others and the events of daily life 
as great as this sounds why is working living and loving together so challenging sometimes why are we frequently tempted to go it alone rather than deal with the hassles or complications associated with 
working with others to accomplish some goal or pursue some purpose why do so many of us try to go it alone fear anxiety the belief that don have anything to give the feeling that don measure up there are many 
reasons most of which can be broken down into two categories supply 
attitudinal obstacles may want to win at all costs driven by the need to compete with others may suffer from narrow thinking discount the contributions of anyone outside of my family or group may be arrogant 
might consider myself superior to others and therefore have nothing to learn from others could also be burned out simply may not be able to reach beyond my own self absorption or frustration 

behavioral obstacles may be hostile toward others tough to collaborate with this one perhaps am unable or willing to deal with conflict maybe am victim of learned helplessness see myself as victim and all 
others as potential oppressors may lack basic social or relational skills might have trouble integrating the various facets of my life and therefore feel threatened by those who enjoy greater degree of 
integration or wholeness 

working playing and praying together requires trust 
these obstacles and many others like them can seriously undermine my ability to live life with others to live life to the fullest said another way our failure to collaborate can leave us in very lonely place 
seen through the eyes of salesian spirituality collaboration might be described as as dialogical mutual engagement in the art of living jesus it means teaching each other growing together mining the tradition 
together sharing the various wisdoms gained through our diverse life experiences leaven for the loaf 

st francis de sales challenged us be who you are be that well while we do indeed need to be ourselves we are most likely to do that successfully by being with one another 
that which truly satisfies 

on scale of one to ten how strong is my desire for justice 
do treat others in ways that would want them to treat me 
what are the circumstances or situations in which am more frequently tempted to be easy on myself but tough on others 
in what ways do need to be more single hearted how might be better at judging myself and others by the same standard 
can think of time when really tried to do the right thing how did it feel how was it satisfying 
how good am at living and practicing the golden rule 

hungering for what is right
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are those who hunger and thirst 
to see right prevail they shall be satisfied 
think of all the things for which we hunger and thirst love acceptance success peace forgiveness happiness truth joy where on our list do we find righteousness or justice 
to follow christ is to hunger and thirst for what is right for what is just how deeply do we want and work for righteousness how much is this desire part of our everyday lives how important is this in our 
relationships with others is our hunger and thirst for justice so strong that we sometimes think we can actually taste it 
we lose nothing by living generously nobly courteously and with royal just reasonable heart 

jesus promises us that there is satisfaction not only in later heaven but already right here on earth when we want and work for righteousness and justice however it not about doing more or doing extra it 
really about being true to our god given nature 
st francis de sales observed the following in part iii chapter 36 of his introduction to the devout life we are human solely because we possess reason yet it is indeed rare thing to find people who are truly 
reasonable this is because self love leads us away from reason and directs us imperceptibly into countless small yet dangerous acts of injustice or iniquity 
it is in our nature to hunger and thirst 
for justice unfortunately the effects of original sin and our own personal sins make it far more difficult for us to make the dream of justice reality 
 
how deeply do we want and work for righteousness how much is this desire part of our everyday lives how important is this thirst for justice in our relationships with others is our hunger for justice so strong 
that we can actually taste it 
 
the great enemy of justice and righteousness is living life with double standard francis de sales wrote we condemn every little thing in our neighbor but excuse ourselves of important things we want to sell 
for top dollar but want to buy at bargain prices we want everything we say to others to be well received but we are very tender and touchy about what others say about us we rigorously demand our own rights but 
want others to be considerate when demanding theirs we complain easily about our neighbors but we never want them to complain about us and the list goes on and on ibid 
the truth is that hungering and thirsting for justice isn about marching in parade or protest it not about volunteering in third world country it not about picketing or boycotting most days it about simply 
treating others the way we want to be treated not very complicated but no less demanding be just in all your actions wrote de sales always put yourself in your neighbor place and your neighbor in yours and 
then you will live rightly imagine yourself the seller when you buy and the buyer when you sell then you will sell and buy justly ibid 
curiously at least for francis de sales hungering and thirsting for righteousness is closely related to another beatitude being single hearted  he concludes we lose nothing by living generously nobly 
courteously and with royal just and reasonable single heart examine your heart often to see if it is such toward your neighbor as you would like your neighbor to be toward you ibid 

hunger and thirst for righteousness live each day with single heart put yourself in your neighbor place find satisfaction in treating others justly and live satisfying life 
seeing god 
what does being single hearted mean to you at this point in your life 
in what ways do you find yourself tempted to do things or relate to others for self serving reasons 
can you think of recent situation or experience in which to the best of your recollection you did something for the best of motives how did that feel what were the circumstances who was involved how did things 
turn out 
in what areas of your life might you need to work to better purify your intentions or motives for doing what you do or being the way you are 
being single hearted 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the single hearted they shall see 
god 
there are number of ways to describe the single hearted those whose hearts are clean those whose hearts have been purified those whose motives are unadulterated hose who know themselves those who are guileless 
those who clearly know why they do what they do those who are able to see the truth because they attempt to live it themselves 
you get the idea 

cling only to the one desire to please 
god considering nothing else unless it fulfills that desire 
francis de sales offers great deal of reflection upon this beatitude this way of being blessed he looks to the to the example of the saints consider that their legs arms and heads are uncovered because in 
their thoughts affections and deeds they have no purpose or motive but that of pleasing god introduction to the devout life part chapter 
indeed this sets the standard for being single hearted francis de sales described it thus in the pursuit of virtue the less we consult our own interests the more the purity of divine love shines from those 
virtues m1 part iv chapter 14 put another way francis wrote that god seeks to lead us to great purity of heart renunciation of all self interest in what relates to god service and perfect self denial chapter 15 
the goal of the pure of heart the goal of the single hearted is union with the beloved francis wrote if approach and join myself to another for no purpose other than to be 
near that person and to enjoy this union it is an approach of pure and simple union treatise vii 
 
now the sovereign motive of our actions which is that of heavenly love has this sovereign property that being more pure it makes the actions that proceed from it more pure 
 
think about it no matter how deeply we love another person no matter how committed we are to doing what is right and just no matter how pure our motives there is always the temptation to love whom we love and 
to do what we do for less than noble or for self serving reasons what in this for me will this help my career will this make me more popular does this make me feel good will this give me an advantage 
francis de sales offers wonderful image in his treatise on the love of god of what it means to be truly single hearted in the service of god and by extension in the service of our brothers and sisters one of 
the world finest musicians who played the lute to perfection in brief time became so extremely deaf that he completely lost the use of his hearing however in spite of that he did not give up singing and 
playing the lute doing so with marvelous delicacy by reason of his great skill which his deafness had not taken away he derived no pleasure from his singing or in the sound of the lute since after his loss of 
hearing he could not perceive their sweetness or beauty hence he no longer sang or played except to entertain the prince whose native subject he was and whom he has great inclination as well as infinite 
obligation to please for this reason he had the very greatest pleasure in pleasing the prince and was overjoyed when the prince showed that he enjoyed the music book ix chapter 
in the pursuit of virtue the less we consult our own interests the more divine love shines from them 
single hearted doing what we do being who we are not because of any advantage / benefit to us but ultimately for god when we attempt to live this way we will not only see god clearly in the next life but will 
indeed glimpse god in this life making pure music to god through our motives of service to one another sons and daughters of god

how do we define peace how do i experience peace what things or activities help me to remain at peace 
in what areas of my life do lack peace what things cause me to lose peace how might need to strive for peace in my life 
how peace filled are my relationships are there any relationships in my life that are in need of peace 
what can i do to promote peace at home at work among my neighbors among my relatives and friends 
in what ways am an effective peacemaker 
how do need to be better peacemaker 

blessed are peacemakers 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is 
blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called children of god 
making peace is about establishing maintaining and nourishing right relationships right relations with god with self with others and with the created order 
peacemakers strive to create places in which evil 
violence and injustice are diminished and righteousness healing and justice are increased they are committed to making peace even in the face of misunderstanding resistance and 
hostility peacemakers work for integration health wholeness and holiness especially with the people with whom they interact every day 
live in peace often say to our lord that you want to be whatever god wants you to be 
francis de sales gives us much food for thought and action when it comes to making peace he wrote we must in all things and everywhere live peacefully if trouble exterior or 
interior comes upon us we must 
receive it peacefully if joy comes we must receive it peacefully without throbbing heart if we need to avoid evil we must do so peacefully without disquieting ourselves otherwise 
we may fall as we run away and 
give time to our enemy to kill us if there is peace to be promoted we must do that peacefully otherwise we might commit many faults in our hurry even our repentance itself must 
be made peacefully letters to religious 62 
we must in all things and everywhere live peacefully if trouble comes upon us we must receive it peacefully if there is peace to be promoted we must do that peacefully even our 
repentance itself must be made peacefully 
of course we know from human history and from our own personal experiences that peacemaking seems to bring with it its own share of trouble peacemaking is not only its own reward sometimes it is its own 
punishment ever heard the expression that no good deed goes unpunished 
in order to shed light on this truth st francis de sales offered the following observation our lord is called the prince of peace therefore wherever christ is absolute master all is peace yet it is true that 
before giving peace he causes war separating heart and soul from our dearest most intimate and most common affections mt 10 34 such as inordinate love of self confidence in self complacency in self and the 
like now when our lord separates us from such fondly cherished passions it seems as if our hearts have been flayed alive nevertheless notwithstanding all this writhing in spirit it is not without peace so long 
as we keep our will nailed to god will while in no way repudiating our obligations nor the brave fulfillment of them we do not lose peace to be at peace amid wars and to live in sweetness amid bitterness is to 
be truly prince of peace letters to religious 
to be sure then peace is not the same as the absence of conflict or difficulty it is about remaining grounded in the love of christ who is the source of all true and lasting peace 

our lord will give us peace when we resolve to live humbly and gently in state of war 

peace is something for which all of us deeply hope and long yet peace sometimes seems so very elusive how can we effectively promote peace for ourselves and others francis de sales offered this advice let us 
do three things and we shall have peace first let us have thoroughly pure intention of desiring the honor and glory of god in all things second let us do the little we can for that end and according to the 
advice of spiritual companions third let us leave to god the care of all the rest letters to religious 60 

live in peace walk in peace share it with others peacefully work 

how do feel about work how do feel about my job 
do see the value of work do see god in whatever work paid or unpaid in which am engaged 
are there ways in which need to improve my appreciation of work 
are there ways in which need to better integrate my experience of work or labor with the other aspects of my life 
does work have role to play in my spiritual journey 
how might need to have more positive view or attitude toward my place of work our lot in life 
in his book spirituality @ work gregory pierce observes popular culture presents work as at best tedious distraction and at worst rat race in which in the words of comedian lily 
tomlin even if you win you're still rat chapter page 18 
work it seems has become four letter word gregory pierce concludes that for most people work is alienating oppressive exhausting anything but spiritual ibid 
is work nothing more than punishment is work nothing more than bur den if so how can work possibly play any part in pardon the expression the working out of our salvation 
work is all the effort paid or unpaid that we exert to make the world better place 
perhaps one reason for this unfortunate dichotomy is that when we think of holy men and women throughout the ages we often recall sculptures drawings and paintings in which the 
saints look anything but active 
our most active and energetic saints are sometimes pictured doing nothing more strenuous than holding lily or gazing piously heavenward and while these images can be moving and 
inspiring and helpful for times 
of contemplation if one is searching for models of action and energy they can hold somewhat less appeal james martin sj in patrons and protectors more occupations by michael 
neill mcgrath consider the 
possibility that it is our understanding of work that is the problem not work itself 

popular culture presents work as at best tedious distraction and at worst rat race 
 
the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines work as physical or mental effort or activity directed toward the production or accomplishment of something 
something that one is doing making 
or performing especially as an occupation or undertaking duty or task 
by this definition all of us work throughout all our lives we are working on tasks responsibilities opportunities hopes dreams and relationships on any given day at any given 
moment young or old active or 
retired salaried or volunteer we are all engaged in some kind of undertaking be it great or small 
it is in this light that james martin writes perhaps the most overlooked fact from christian history is that jesus worked we can easily envision jesus being instructed by saint 
joseph the master carpenter in 
joseph workshop in nazareth jesus would have learned about the raw materials of his craft joseph would have taught his apprentice the right way to drive nail with 
hammer to drill clean deep hole in plank to level ledge or lintel ibid 
can we not see how the skills of craftsman patience diligence perseverance honesty and others would later serve jesus well in his greatest work that of accomplishing the will of god by proclaiming the kingdom of god 
gregory pierce suggests that we need to see and experience work as all the effort paid or unpaid we exert to make the world better place little closer to the way god would have things spirituality @ work page 18 
 
how can work play any part in the working out of our salvation 

our god is the god of creation we are called to reflect the image and likeness of this creating god we accomplish this most clearly when we work to make our world our offices 
our neighborhoods and our homes places that more perfectly mirror the justice and peace of god 
work god work is indeed our lot in life our reason for being our purpose for living as we see in the life of jesus himself this work can be tiring laborious and frustrating 
still what could be more rewarding 
than using all of our energies to make all our little comers of the world more reflective of the kingdom of god 
come on there work to do 
 
compassion and contrition 

how do experience sorrow 
what kinds of situations circumstances or experiences result in my feeling sorrow 
am compassionate person am moved by the situations or plights of others how do express that compassion 
am truly sorry for my sins and imperfections does my sorrow over my sins and faults motivate me to try to do better with god help 
do experience the dark side of sorrow do find myself getting down or negative 
what kinds of things tempt me to experience unhealthy sorrow what can do to resist the negative effects of sorrow 

blessed are the sorrowful 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are 
the sorrowful they shall find consolation blessed happy are the sorrowful isn this contradiction in terms 
not if we understand the proper meaning of sorrow as francis de sales did sorrow is an affection that makes us share in the suffering and sorrow of the ones we love sorrow 
makes others experiences of good and evil our own treatise on the love of god book chapter 
 
sorrow is an affection that makes us share in the suffering of others as well as owning our own suffering 
sorrow of this kind is the basis for empathy sympathy and compassion it is the result of being affected and impacted by the plights of others it is manifestation of our 
willingness to be moved by the struggles 
setbacks and calamities of those whom we encounter de sales wrote piety is virtuous sorrow which comes into our hearts in order to make us desire to deliver our neighbor from 
the evil that he or she endures treatise book chapter 
jesus challenge is obvious to the extent that we are moved by the plight of others and try to be source of consolation and support we too are more likely to find coorrow and 
setback in our own lives 

this sorrow of which jesus speaks is also an expression of contrition for our own sinfulness francis de sales remarked perfect penitence has two effects sorrow that separates 
us from sin and love which reconciles and reunites us with god treatise book ii chapter 20 

perfect penitence has two effects first it produces sorrow that separates us from sin second it opens us to love that reconciles us and reunites us with god 

there is an interesting flip side to this sorrow francis observed the throne of god mercy is our sorrow therefore the greater our sorrow the greater should be our confidence 
conferences ii page 19 as profound 
as our sorrow for our own sin may be this sorrow should indeed be ultimately overshadowed by our confidence in god long suffering and abundant patience with us and forgiveness 
of us put another way this sorrow 
at its best should be an expression of profound humility humility allows us to see the real good that god has planted in us conferences vi 76 sorrow for sin should lead us to 
reaffirm our god given dignity and 
to redouble our efforts in giving witness to our god given goodness by our thoughts feelings attitudes and actions 
however we need to be cautious like many things in life our sorrow needs to be balanced healthy sorrow can quickly become something unhealthy and debilitating francis de sales 
offered this advice in his 
introduction to the devout life sorrow can be either good or evil according to the ways in which it affects us true enough it can produce more bad effects than good ones it has 
two good effects compassion and 
repentance whereas it has six evil ones anxiety sloth wrath jealousy envy and impatience part iv chapter 12 
healthy sadness in an expression of our sorrow for sin or evil 
we know that we have tendency to avoid sorrow at any and all costs francis de sales reminds us that sorrow is helpful even necessary if we are to be truly happy in this life 
healthy sorrow allows us to display 
compassion for sufferings of others and to experience repentance for our sins and imperfections still we need to experience to practice—sorrow in ways that does not inhibit or 
retard our growth as sons and aughters of the living god 

remember it blessed are the sorrowful not the miserable how do we deal 

has my faith in good caring and provident god been shaken by such tragic events as september 11 2001 
does my faith help me to deal with tragic events either public or private if yes how if no why not 
how do find comfort when am affected by things like sickness separation or death 
people claim that sharing sorrow or grief can lessen the pain is this your experience 
how do try to comfort those who suffer how have others tried to comfort me 
how would answer the question why do bad things happen to good people 

with tragic events 

as believers we try to see all the events of life with the eyes of god even those including suffering loss tragedy and depth our faith challenges us to believe that the redemptive and saving power of the cross 
of christ is present in all our experiences especially in those most painful but the terrible acts of terrorism that occurred on september 11 2001 have shaken our faith we wonder aloud or in the quiet of our 
hearts where was god on the morning of september 11th how could loving and all powerful god allow such horrible thing to occur why does god allow such terrible things to happen to good innocent people 
 
how do answer these and similar questions for others for that matter how do answer them for myself 

remember one attempt at explaining this mystery that heard when was in graduate school when you look at the back of tapestry all you see are knotted and gnarled threads that are intertwined in chaotic and 
unsightly fashion this appearance is confusing at best outright ugly at worst by contrast the front of the tapestry is beautiful masterpiece that soothes the mind heart and spirit 

when we come face to face with evil we are as it were looking at the backside of the tapestry of life we see its chaos sin pain suffering and injustice of course even in the midst of evil life has yet another 
side goodness justice freedom reconciliation and peace because of the victory of the resurrection over sin suffering and death good has and will triumph over evil despite the appearance at times to the 
contrary at the end of history it will be clear that
love will conquer all until the second coming only faith can find consolation in this truth 

still any attempt on our part to make sense of evil is ultimately unsatisfactory how much comfort can my explanation bring to grieving parents whose child has been killed by drunk driver how can the image of 
the tapestry of life console husband whose wife loses her fight with cancer leaving him alone to care for four young children 
months pass wounds heal life goes on and we try to go on with it even to the degree that peoples lives may return to normal at some point following the experience of tragic suffering injustice or loss are they 
ever really normal again people will still struggle to understand why terrible things happen to any of us 
francis de sales himself grappled with this issue he readily admitted that some mysteries are inscrutable exceeding our ability to grasp them fully this is especially true of destructive acts of nature or 
horrific results of the human ability to choose for francis de sales it is only in the next life that we will understand the mysteries and conflicts of this life 
 
however we must strive to be sources of consolation and strength to others when terrible sometimes unspeakable things happen to good people or to anybody for that matter in the end it is probably not our words 
no matter how informed or carefully crafted that will make healing sustaining difference in the lives of those men woman and children touched by tragedy no what ultimately helps are hands that reach out to 
them in love and arms that cradle them in their grief 

how ready are our hands our arms and our hearts to reach out to others 
being yourself 
is there harmony in my life among my faith my relationship with god my relationships with family and friends my work or do feel conflict 
do sometimes feel as though am just acting just putting on show rather than saying and doing what is really in my heart 
how transparent am willing to be am willing to allow people to know me to see who am 
where do my energies go are they scattered and dissipated or are they channeled toward being who god calls me to be 
do know who god is calling me to be or do need to spend more time with god in prayer and discernment 

being authentic 
salesian spirituality is lived from the inside out it begins in the heart and flows outward when love of god is inscribed in our hearts all of our actions will be authentically loving 
since the heart is the source of all our actions as the heart is so are they 
actions that do not flow from loving heart while they might be outwardly admirable are hollow 
person considers herself very devout because she recites daily multiplicity of prayers although immediately afterwards she utters the most disagreeable arrogant and injurious words in her home and among her 
neighbors still another draws alms out of his purse to give to the poor but cannot draw meekness out of his heart to forgive his enemies people such as these are commonly 
perceived as devout when in fact they are not a mess 
our spiritual life is not something extra not something added onto our everyday lives our spiritual life is integrated into every part of our lives 
st francis de sales taught that life of true devotion is authentic true devotion comes from the heart there is no conflict between the inside and the outside our spirituality permeates our whole being 
authenticity means that the love of god invades our soul takes root there grows and bears fruit 
we find model of authenticity in the life and ministry of jesus wherever he went jesus attracted people because there was something trustworthy about him something in his manner and message that touched people 
hearts his ministry reflected deep and intimate relationship with his father and was nourished by life of prayer jesus lived his life from the inside out it was precisely because of this congruity between 
jesus inside and jesus outside that he taught and spoke with authority people found jesus to be not only informative more importantly they found him to be believable 
authenticity for us means allowing the word of god to enter our heart and transform us life of faith love and service in imitation of jesus will be the fruit of that transformation the spirit will be able to 
work in and through us in ways that go far beyond our everyday expectations 
integrity is another way to think of authenticity our spiritual life is not something extra not something added onto our everyday lives our spiritual life is integrated into every 
part of our lives our actions give expression to the love that is in our hearts 
we are called to be holy and authentic whatever our state in life we need to know who we are and to be who we are 

be who you are and be that well 

when we are authentic we are in right relationship with ourselves there is integrity wholeness and harmony among all of the parts of the complex universe within us our focus is sharpened because our motives 
and actions are pure and unambiguous being authentic being real with ourselves enables us to be authentic to be real with others we can allow them to see who we truly are and to 
know who we truly are we in turn are better able to see and accept others for who they really are 
ultimately such authenticity such honesty such integrity allows us to accept the truth of who we are in the eyes of god accepting the truth of who we are better enables us with 
gods grace to accept the truth of who we might yet become 

the fruit of knowing and being authentic is inner harmony inner peace 

engrave and inscribe on your heart this holy sacred maxim live jesus am sure that your life which comes from the heart just as the almond tree comes 
no time 
how good am at living in the present 
are there things in my past upon which dwell too often what are they why do they hold my attention 
are there things in my future about which am anxious or distracted what are they why do they hold my attention 
living in the present is hard work it requires discipline but it is skill that can be developed with little simple steps what can do to better live each present moment to the fullest 
what in my past needs reconciliation and healing 
about what in my future do need faith and confidence 

like the present 
in his book entitled the seven secrets of successful catholics author paul wilkes observes ours is life lived in the present tense memories may be precious or 
painful plans lofty or low but all we really have 
to live is today each day each hour brings with it opportunities for our spirits to soar for us to become the people we know we can be 
do you have regrets about your past do you sometimes wonder how your life might be different if you had made different choices in the past do you frequently 
revisit painful or unresolved memories 
are you anxious about the future do you worry about the things that might happen in the days weeks and years to come do you spend time trying to anticipate what 
tomorrow will bring welcome to the human race it is natural to live with an eye to
the past it is natural to live with an eye toward the future however focusing only upon the past or the future robs you the time that really matters 
the present the struggle to live in the present is nothing new our lord jesus himself addressed it in matthew gospel mt 
25 34 when he said do not worry about your life who of you by worrying can add single hour to your life do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about 
itself each day has enough trouble of its own 
st francis de sales and st jane de chantal frequently counseled people who were either imprisoned by past sins struggles and failures or fixated upon future 
challenges trials or tribulations some especially tormented souls were consumed by both 
the remedy for scruples flowing from the past the day that is past must not judge the day present the day that is present must not judge the day past it is only 
the last day that judges all 
the remedy for anxieties flowing from the future let us be firmly resolved to serve god with our whole heart and life beyond that let us have no care about 
tomorrow let us think of only living well today and when tomorrow comes it will be called today then we can think about it 
living in the present is good psychology the present is the only place where you grow as you grow you can gracefully let go of painful past as you grow you can 
peacefully embrace an uncertain future in short you experience forgiveness and fortitude 

living in the present is sound theology there is no beginning or end for god there is only an eternal now to that end you are most like god when you live in the 
present as you grow in the image and likeness of 
god you open yourself to the power of god forgiveness as you grow in the image and likeness of god you open yourself to the promise of god providence 

in short you experience redemption 
maybe this is what st paul had in mind when he made the assertion tell you now is the time of god favor now is the day of salvation 

experience healing from the past experience confidence about the future above all recognize the opportunities that god brings each day each hour each moment to 
let your spirit soar to become more of the person who god calls you to be 

in the here and now in the present 
to forgive as god forgives 
how merciful and forgiving am do try to treat others with mercy leniency clemency forbearance and charity 
in what ways or situations am tempted to not extend mercy toward others 
how has god been merciful to me how has god been lenient compassionate kind and forgiving to me 
do try to forgive as god forgives 
what are some things in my life that make it more difficult or challenging for me to be merciful 

blessed are the merciful 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the merciful mercy shall be shown 
to them 
let us begin by first examining more closely our understanding of mercy itself it is defined as kind and compassionate treatment of an offender enemy prisoner or other person under one power clemency 
disposition to be kind and forgiving mercy emphasizes compassion in general way it suggests reprieve from fate of considerable severity without further implication american heritage dictionary new college 
edition 
synonyms associated with mercy include leniency clemency forbearance and charity 

from the heights of heaven jesus 
christ mercifully looks upon you and graciously invites you there 
 
we turn our attention to the gospel of matthew to understand the importance that mercy plays in our relationships with god and our relationships with one another the parable of the unmerciful servant unique to 
matthew is one of the sternest passages of the gospels it reinforces the duty of forgiveness by appealing to another motive the forgiveness granted by man to man as condition of forgiveness granted to man by 
god the jerome biblical commentary in the parable king ultimately cancels huge debt owed to him not by slave but high officer of state this same officer by contrast when confronting subordinate who owed him 
mere fraction of what the former owed the king refuses to hear the subordinate plea of mercy when word gets back to the king the official is condemned for his unwillingness to show mercy and is turned over to 
torturers 
 
mercy empathy and sympathy are closely related they enable us to enter the mind heart shoes or skin of another person they enable us to put ourselves in the place of another they enable us to truly know and 
 
the jerome biblical commentary concludes the conduct of the king is not model by which we should learn about the providence of god the detail that is most significant is the difference in the debt owed by the 
unmerciful servant and the debt that he claims the model is the forgiveness of god which knows no limit and neither should man forgiveness if man does not forgive he cannot expect forgiveness if he does not 
renounce his own claims which are small he cannot ask god to dismiss the claims presumably much greater against him ibid 
francis de sales places high premium upon the mercy of god he wrote god did not save us out of justice for anything we have done but according to god mercy treatise part chapter 18 god mercy not only saved us 
however but also enables us to be the people that god calls us to be god assists us to strive toward the life to which god calls us in this way god shows us divine mercy by not asking us to strive for 
something that is unobtainable 

god how merciful is god goodness to us in the end all of the good we do depends on god mercy 

how seriously do we think about the lord prayer when we pray it how conscious are we of the explicit link that we acknowledge that exists between god forgiveness of us and our forgiveness of one another how 
conscious are we of our obligation as followers of jesus to be as merciful with others as god is merciful with us 
make no mistake about it we are most human when we show mercy to others in fact we are most divine when we show mercy to others if that not motivation enough scripture is quite clear if we wish to enjoy god 
mercy we must extend mercy to one another from our hearts 
what are friends for 
who are the people in my life whom would describe as friends 
in what ways to they befriend me 
how do they help me to be the kind of person that god wants me to be 
are there any faults or imperfections in my friends that need to gently address 
are there any dimensions echoes or shadows of sin in my friend ships 
what kind of friend am 
do encourage my friends to do what is right and good in the eyes of god 
what faults or imperfections do need to address in myself 
in what ways must purify myself from sin or the affection for sin 

our growth in holiness 
in the salesian tradition having friends is more than just good or desire able thing true friends are irreplaceable allies in our efforts to grow in holiness drawing from the book of sirach st francis de sales 
wrote faithful friend is strong defense and those who find one have found treasure faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality those who fear the lord find one idl part chapter 

so important is the subject and nature of friendship that francis de sales devotes no less than six chapters of his introduction to the devout life to its consideration in part iii chapter 19 he observed love 
everyone with deep love based on charity but form friendships only with those who can share virtuous things with you the higher the virtues you share and exchange with others the more perfect your friendship 
will be 
 love everyone with great love but have no friendship except for those that communicate with you in the things of virtue 
three things must be present in order for relationship to be considered friendship all love is not friendship because we can love without being loved in such cases there is love but not friendship since 
friendship is mutual love and if not mutual it is not friendship second it is not sufficient for it to be merely mutual persons who love each other must be aware of their reciprocal affection if they are not 
aware of the affection it is not friendship third there must also be communication between them and this is the basis of friendship 
holy friendship speaks plain and sincere language it commends nothing but virtue and the grace of god the only foundation on which it subsists 
francis identified three levels or kinds of friendship each of which is recognized by the focus of the exchange between or among the friends being considered if this participation is in matters of knowledge 
the resulting friendship is certainly very praiseworthy it is still more so if you have virtues in common namely prudence temperance fortitude and justice if your mutual and reciprocal exchanges concern 
charity devotion and christian perfection god how precious this friendship will be 
friends then when at their best walk with and encourage one another along the road to salvation 
of course like lots of things in life even friends aren always at their best sometimes our friendships don exactly draw us closer to god or to the things of god francis addressed this reality as well there is 
hardly anyone who is entirely free from imperfections everyone has enough bad inclinations of their own without burdening oneself with others’ friendship requires us to aid and assist one another to be free 
from every kind of fault while we must meekly put up with friend faults we must not lead them into faults much less imitate their faults 
when it comes to sin however friendship takes no prisoners as to sins we must neither occasion them nor tolerate them in our friends wrote de sales it is either weak or sinful friendship that watches our 
friend perish without helping him that sees the other die of abscess and does not save her life by opening it with the lance of correction genuine living friendship cannot continue in the midst of sin 
the more exquisite the virtues that are the focus of your communications the more perfect also shall your friendship be 
friends are for our growth in health happiness and holiness on this earth in order to better prepare us to share together the gift of eternal life in heaven 
st jane described spiritual friendship this way nearly four hundred years ago to the sisters of the visitation if we are closely united one with another we shall walk with great strides to perfection 
god grant us make us such friends as we walk together with great strides along the road to perfection 
five steps 
how much serenity do experience  at this point in my life 
what are the areas of my life in which am experiencing the greatest need for serenity 
of the five steps that francis de sales offers which one do find most attractive why 
of the five steps that francis de sales offers which do find most challenging why 
do make time and space for prayer even the simplest forms of prayer during an average day 
what temptations in my life sorely try my attempts to practice serenity 
what practices or attitudes do find most helpful in my attempts to be even tempered 

to spiritual serenity 

serenity composure equanimity these nouns describe the state of person who is calm or centered and who is not easily agitated the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines it as the quality 
of being calm and even tempered having composure which comes from the latin for even tempered or impartial the ability to remain centered or even tempered in the midst of the demands and challenges of every 
day life is tremendously important quality and frequently enough highly elusive one while there is no easy or painless way to acquire this quality st francis de sales offers us five step program that can 
increase our ability to practice and experience serenity 

be on the watch for those temptations that weaken our resistance to sin and / or dissuade us from doing good –

step one choose to live life of devotion make conscious decision to spend each day doing what is right and good do what is right and good readily diligently and frequently st francis de sales writes true 
devotion perfects all things every vocation becomes more agreeable when united with true devotion care of one family becomes more peaceable love of husband or wife more sincere service to one employer more 

step two prayer prayer helps us to remain centered prayer helps us to remain anchored prayer helps us to deal with what happens around us while avoiding agitation inside us 

develop practice and strengthen those habits that support your resolve to live life of devotion 
make time for personal prayer practice the awareness of the presence of god prepare your day anticipate all that you must accomplish or might encounter today make an examination of conscience twice day once 
around noon the second in early evening reflect on scripture or other spiritual reading as part of larger commitment to prayer make use of the sacraments eucharist reconciliation and when appropriate anointing 
seek the grace and courage you need to lead life of serenity in the midst of life activities 

step three practice virtue develop practice and strengthen those habits that support your resolve to live life of devotion in the salesian tradition some of the more important virtues include 

prayer helps us to remain centered prayer helps us to remain anchored while avoiding agitation 

step five rest retreat renewal take / make opportunities for spiritual time out in the midst of each day activities where possible make an actual retreat every year take time make space to examine your progress 
on the road to devotion seek forgiveness for your failings give thanks for your successes above all find ways to remind you of the things in life that really matter and that lead to serenity in the hereafter 
gentleness 
do i see the value of gentleness 
do i have real difficulties inbeing patient and gentle with others 
do i have real difficulties inbeing patient or gentle with myself 
how do i handle setbacks and disappointments in my life 
how do i respond or react when things don't go my way 
what are the things that push my buttons and tempt me to lose my cool with myself 
what are the things that push my buttons and tempt me to lose my cool with others 

forgotten virtue 

in world in which the pace of life has become more frenetic and hectic we seem to be lot less patient and lot more prone to anger with one another any wonder we have so many ways to describe this behavior this 
person went postal that person exhibited road rage so and so had meltdown 
we really seem to have lost our sense to say nothing of the practice of gentleness 
jesus himself spoke of the importance of gentleness in matthew gospel 

take my yoke upon your shoulders and learn from me for am gentle and humble of heart 

gentleness is not very popular virtue or value these days in some ways we have ourselves to blame gentleness is often translated as meek which is perceived and even defined in some places as being spineless 
weak pushover or wimp 
small wonder that gentleness has fallen on hard times in our time 
jesus is not calling us to weakness in fact he is calling us to kind of strength and tenacity that can only result from taking up his yoke that is embracing all the challenges that come each and every day to 
those who attempt to live god centered life 
here it seems to me is the rub we grow impatient and angry with others when we experience conflict disappointment or difficulties with others because we expect that nothing and no one should interfere with our 
plans for life small wonder therefore when others faults sins and imperfections seem to conspire to stand in our way 
life is not perfect other people aren perfect god forbid even am not perfect 

sad to say there is an ever deeper reality that we need to confront sometimes the person with whom we are ultimately angry and impatient is ourselves 
why is gentleness such an important virtue simply because life is not perfect others aren perfect not perfect when we live our lives so intolerant of others and our own imperfections we look for and experience 
nothing but trouble 
what burden 
st francis de sales struggled with anger and impatience in his own life he had sense of urgency in his personal and professional endeavors that sorely tempted his practice of gentleness just as he learned that 
he could not force himself or others to grow in holiness he also recognized that it was only when he was able to graciously embrace life heartaches disappointments frustrations and failures that he could truly 
hope to work through and overcome them 
the paradox only when we can accept the burdens of life does life cease to be so burdensome before we can expect life to get better we must first accept life as it is 
the practice of this virtue needs to start at home we need to begin with ourselves we need to accept the reality of our sins our weaknesses our faults and failings we need to ask god for the grace to move 
through and beyond them without beating up on ourselves our energies are better used by cooperating with god saving grace than by being in constant state of frustration or rage 

only when we accept the burdens of life does life become less burdensome 

likewise we need to be gentle toward one another especially the people we know and love the most in truth these are the people whose faults and failings are most obvious to us therefore it is all the more 
important that we acknowledge that they too are not perfect but rather are works god’ works in progress 

moving forward let drive learn live and love gently 
 
first things 
what can do to tie my heartstrings closer to god how can friends help me 
how do feel about letting go and taking francis advice to live one day at time leaving the rest to god care 
is it difficult for me not to worry about things which cannot control 
have been hurt over something in the past which hinders me from being all that can be today how do feel about honestly facing that hurt and moving on so that can grow closer to god 
how do feel about preparing for the day planning what will do and how will go about doing it do feel that it is practical and possible to direct all my intentions towards growing closer to god 
respecting the dignity of persons is often about forgiving and forgetting forgiving is gift you give yourself which becomes the start or impetus for forgetting and in the end healing how then is respecting the 
dignity of another healthy thing for me 

first 
our lives are filled with choices should we do this or should we do that should we go here or should we go there 
indeed our complicated lifestyles often bring conflicting demands which frequently can become too much for us to handle how often have we thought to ourselves if life would just slow down little could get 
things done easier but the question remains how can slow myself down and make better live each moment as it comes 
francis de sales tells us that the salesian spirit is deeply rooted in our efforts to grow in grace through the little day to day experiences of life de sales knew that stress anxiety and even panic are not 
the answer to either accomplishing things or finding peace he compares our frenzied lives to caged bird and our finding peace to bird who is free the former flutters his wings so much that he entraps himself 
all the more but like the second little bird without constraints when we stop the wing flapping we soar closer to god we can start this growth process by praying and prioritizing our daily activities 
first we should take time everyday to pray francis writes that when little bees are caught in storm they take hold of small stones so that they can keep their balance when they fly prayer like the stones can 
balance us it helps us to make the best use of each day each moment as it comes 
eventually as we fly we free ourselves to see that our vocation or our calling in life is our means to holiness imagine being holy by just doing our everyday jobs de sales terms this process living in the 
present moment and he teaches that everybody can achieve it and achieve it well 
god has not placed perfection in the multiplicity of acts we perform to please him but only in the way we perform them which is simply to do the little we do according to our vocation in love by love and for 
love 
slowing down our pace and living more simply can still permit us to engage in the busyness of everyday life but it is anew sense of peace which helps us to stop dwelling on the past or being anxious about the 
future 
de sales was busy bishop and professional man in his introduction to devout life he writes that lawyer must go from prayer to the courtroom the merchant from prayer to his store homemaker from prayer to her 
responsibilities each person he writes needs gentleness that will not cause distress this gentleness helps us pray and work better and to see that both are gift from god 
st jane de chantal was wife widow mother single parent businesswoman and later nun indeed jane was one busy lady when for example she responded to god call to transition from widowhood to founding the sisters 
 of the visitation de sales warned her that she would come under some serious criticism both from her family and friends he was quite correct still she moved on with her life she was truly lover of god finding 
peace in everyday simplicity and prayer 
even when we seek to live in the present moment we may regret the past or fret about an uncertain future and sadden ourselves 
sometimes even when we seek to live in the present moment we may regret the past or fret about an uncertain future and sadden ourselves de sales paraphrases st paul cor 17 10 when he states that human sorrow 
is both blessing and curse like compass needle which always points north regardless of the ship course if we will aspire toward god de sales says those changes of life will not unsteady us though sadness can 
appear negative it can instill in us sense of repentance and compassion and lead us to virtue as we strive to overcome it 

salesian spirituality invites us to trust in god providence either god will protect us from misfortune or god will give us the strength to bear it with confidence we can cast our cares on god 
because he cares for us 

in the midst of all the things that fill each day let put first things first 
easier said 
what is my notion of justice 
do my actions and attitudes promote justice 
am too critical of others injustices but too lax regarding my own 
how do give good example to others of the importance of promoting justice in the lives of others 
in what areas of my life do need to  be more effective in pursuing justice 
what injustices might need to recognize in my own life 
from whom might need to seek forgiveness 
how far am willing to go in promoting justice 

than done 
we all want justice we all want justice for ourselves we all want justice for those we know and love we all want justice hopefully for all people 
what does it mean to be just the american heritage dictionary of the english language defines it as honorable and fair in one dealings and actions consistent with what is morally right righteous suitable or 
proper fitting to conform with moral righteousness in action or attitude 
god is the ultimate model and source of all justice perhaps no where else do we see this proclaimed so clearly in scripture as we do in the book of psalms psalm awake my god decree justice psalm god will 
govern the people with justice psalm 
god is the ultimate model and source of all justice 
16 the lord is known by his justice psalm 33 the lord loves righteousness and justice psalm 89 14 justice is the foundation of your throne psalm 99 the king is mighty and loves justice psalm 101 will sing of 
your love and justice of course it is lot easier to simply talk about our desire even our demand for justice than it is to make it real in our own lives and in the lives of others 
francis de sales knew of the difficulties of making justice real when he wrote of the virtue of zeal in his treatise on the love of god in this selection he identified three means or levels of promoting and 
doing what is just the firsthod is not surprisingly the most popular we can promote justice by pointing out other failure to do so this is obviously the easiest because while it demands that we recognize 
the injustices of others it does not require us to do the same of ourselves consumed with do as say not as do mentality we run the risk of being blind in our own supply 
it is lot easier to simply talk about our desire even our demand for justice than it is to make it real in our own lives and in the lives of others 
concerns as it relates to promoting justice thishod believed de sales is the least effective way to promote justice 
the second way to promote justice is
to be less concerned about what others are doing or not doing and to demonstrate our passion by doing acts of great virtue in order to give good example by suggesting remedies for evil encouraging others to 
apply them and doing the good opposed to the evil that we wish to eradicate tlg book ten chapter 16 insofar as this requires us to not only talk the talk but walk the walk francis claimed that few of us are 
anxious to do 
the third the most excellent and the most challenging level or method of promoting justice consists in suffering and enduring many things in order to prevent or avert evil almost no one wants to exercise this 
kind of passion for proclaiming and accomplishing all that is just 

this most demanding but most powerful means of working for justice requires that we be willing to risk everything for what is righteous and just sometimes even life itself no where do we see this risking for 
what is righteous more clearly than in the person of jesus himself no where do we see the passion and price for pursuing what is just more powerfully than on the cross of calvary st francis de sales wrote our 
lord passion appeared principally in his death on the cross to destroy death and the 

no where do we see this risking for what is righteous more clearly than in the person of jesus himself no where do we see the passion and price for pursuing justice more powerfully than on the cross of calvary 

sins of humanity to imitate this method is perfection of courage and an unbelievable fervor of spirit 

the merit of one passion for justice is measured by the willingness to do and suffer for what is right how does my passion measure up 
tools 

what virtues do seem to practice the best at this point in my life 
in what situations are they helpful and effective 
in what situations have they been more difficult or problematic fit 
with which virtues am less comfortable or adept 
what virtues might god be calling me to acquire and practice more at this point in my life 
what things may god be calling me to craft or build at this time in my life which tools seem most necessary or appropriate to the tasks 

of the trade 

my father was builder he built cars for chrysler he built helicopters for boeing vertol what remember most were all the things he built around the house cabinets shelves shutters molding trim and other things 
he was passionate about building he was good at it too 
as boy sometimes sat for hours on stool and watched him create things at his workbench he had tools lots of tools each had its own unique purpose and function 
in the years that observed him build learned three things there is tool for every job there is job for every tool and there no one tool that does it all 
didn inherit my father gift for working with wood yet as enter more deeply into the heart of salesian spirituality more deeply appreciate the wisdom that guided all of my father endeavors in the introduction 
to the devout life francis de sales writes 

frequently the
great fault of those undertaking the practice of virtue is to stubbornly insist upon using particular one in all circumstances 

as useful as saw may be you can drive nails with one as sophisticated as drill press is you shouldn try to cut lumber with one as simple and effective as hammer may be you don use one to cut glass 
the art and discipline of salesian spirituality is about acquiring and mastering as many of the virtues as possible it also challenges us to learn how to match each virtue with the situation relationship or 
circumstance at hand 

we must resist the temptation to become attached to or infatuated with favorite virtue 

and try to make it fit every task or job in life after all if all we ever use is hammer eventually everything in life tends to look like nail 
we are created in the image and likeness of god the master craftsman and the master builder we are called to build the
kingdom of god on this earth precisely in the particular state stage and place in life in which we find ourselves through the inspiration and guidance of the holy spirit we must craft relationships families 
and communities that promote justice and peace reconciliation and healing love and life 

as we attempt to acquire the tools and knowledge needed to live life of virtue we look to the humble gentle compassionate and patient jesus as our teacher guide and companion 

we can force one tool to do it all we need to apply the tools that each situation requires and so to practice discipline that requires the utmost flexibility 

we must keep our minds in tranquility in order to do everything in its season observed st jane de chantal there is time for every tool 

four virtues are absolutely essential in helping to build the kingdom of god 
humility be humble enough to know that there are many tools for living that we can learn from god and one another gentleness we need to let the tools we acquire do the work we must not try to force them 
flexibility we need to select the right tool for the job the right job for the tool we can get attached to select favorite patience creating worthwhile things on earth takes time if rome wasn built in day 
imagine the time required to build something that will last forever in heaven 

in the spirit of st francis de sales and st jane de chantal may we follow the example of our savior who is the son of god and who perhaps not coincidentally was also the son of carpenter 
pursuing perfection 
what does being perfect mean to me 
what does being perfect look or feel like 
how do go about the pursuit of perfection am calm centered and balanced do approach perfection in neurotic or compulsive manner 
for whom do seek perfection god glory or my own 
how does my desire for perfection impact upon my relationships with others 
what are the areas in my life most in need of being perfected or purified what are the best ways of me to address this need in my life right now 

peacefully and patiently 

the salesian tradition holds the human person in high esteem notwithstanding the effects of original sin we are created in the image of god redeemed by jesus christ and inspired by the holy spirit we are good 
by design we are destined for glory 
of course the road to glory has its share of potholes we frequently fail to do the good to which we are called we often do the evil that we are called to avoid in short we don always measure up to our god 
given dignity or destiny 
st jane de chantal believed in the 

we are good by design we are destined for glory 
possibility of human perfection however she was very clear as to the motive for seeking perfection do you think it is to please your understanding or to give you satisfaction no it all must be for the glory of 
god alone making you pliable humble cordial and frank toward others 
conferences 
the problem with pursuing perfection 
is that while we may begin this endeavor with the aim of being more of who god calls us to be our efforts can result with our simply being more full of ourselves true perfection should lead to humility and 
gentleness false perfection leads to pride and arrogance 
the art and discipline of pursuing perfection for st jane de chantal is to pursue it without obsessing about your progress think about it isn the best way to get the most out of leisurely car ride is to get to 
the point where you are enjoying the ride so much that you forget that you are driving 
st jane wrote am pleased to see that you are cutting back on all of your self scrutiny and that you are more peaceful about your desire to make progress eagerness about becoming perfect comes from self love 
always be on guard against this beg of you 
put another way an inordinate desire to be perfected by the will of god can actually be not so camouflaged attempt to glory in one own will and preference such compulsion can be the source of great pain and 
perplexity in our lives observed st jane this is all about your over eagerness to attain the true happiness that you desire you lack the patience and docility to do the will of god who alone can grant you the 
progress and perfection for which you are striving for those who truly wish to pursue perfection they must correct this over eagerness and anxiety 
pursuing perfection needs to be less about us and much more about god it is about our relationship with the father son and spirit seen in this light true christian perfection is all about focus the way to 
perfection is very narrow but it is solid short simple and sure and soon leads the soul to its ultimate goal total union with god 
patience has lot to do with pursuing perfection st francis de sales remarked know that patience is the one virtue that gives us the greatest assurance of our reaching perfection while we must have patience 
with others we must especially have patience with ourselves 
those who aspire to the pure love of god need to be more patient with themselves than with others 
another secret to the discipline of pursuing perfection includes accepting our imperfections st francis de sales observed we have to endure our own imperfections in order to attain perfection say endure 
patiently not love or embrace them humility is nurtured through such endurance 

in the end pursuing perfection is about leaving the results of our efforts in the hands of god said st jane we must be as satisfied to feel powerless idle or inert before god as to be full of life with ease 
and devotion the whole matter of our union with god and our perfection is to be content either way 
step by step 

in what ways are my days frenzied and hectic 
are there specific moments in my day that are fertile with holiness moments that are straw waiting to be spun into gold 
is it possible to lead this kind of life in my busy world today how 
what are some practical things that can do to help me apply francis de sales advice to go into my heart from time to time during the course of the day 
how can living in the present moment be powerful means of growing in holiness how can it help me to be faithful to all the things in my busy life 

meeting life demands 

in hectic world of frenzied activities multiple commitments and looming deadlines the thought of walking gentle prayerful path might seem idealistic and unattainable more than ever we need to practice 
francis de sales spirit of gentleness and calm in the midst of all our busyness 
his world lacking the gadgets the multimedia and the rush that pervade our era was nonetheless jam packed with the 
how good to let providence guide
you step by step 
responsibilities demanded of bishop spiritual director pastor and prolific writer francis had trained himself to walk gently and calmly through the busyness of the most hectic days keeping part of his heart 
focused on god he wanted his spiritual children to do the same it is here philothea1 that want you to firmly follow my advice for it deals with one of the surest means for your spiritual advancement remember 
to withdraw frequently into the solitude of your heart even though you may be in the midst of conversations and affairs 
the latest saint among the followers of salesian spirituality leonie frances de sales aviat learned to do this to stay in god presence in the midst of busyness 
how good to let providence guide you step by step 11 she advised her oblate sisters 
from the moment she followed god will for her and consented to begin the congregation of the oblate sisters of st francis de sales her days were filled with multitude of activities the young working girls 
needed the constant attention of the sisters to supervise and guide them in their factory work the boarders needed the daily maternal care of the sisters in preparing the meals running the house and managing 
funds when sometimes not even sow could be found in the convent purse 
even sunday the proverbial day of rest was devoted to the sunday clubs with the sisters providing the girls with games activities and time together this constant devotedness to the working girls and the 
boarders to managing the newly founded schools and to organizing the sunday clubs left our saint with little leisure time for herself how did leonie aviat fare in the midst of all this busyness 
she like francis de sales learned to use the countless unforeseen events that thwart the planned agenda of each day as little stepping stones to greater union with god 
she mastered the wonderful spiritual secret of spinning straw into gold by taking the very things that could annoy or aggravate and transforming them into events fertile with holiness by surrendering them 
gently to god she followed st francis de sales ideal of sanctifying each present moment and instructing her sisters to live in the present moment in order to receive all the graces which it brings 

we must make serious effort to train our hearts to stay focused and centered in the midst of busy activities practicing gentle surrender to all the happenings of the day 

so what is the great secret of walking gentle prayerful path we must make serious effort to train our hearts to stay focused and centered in the midst of busy activities practicing gentle surrender to all the 
happenings of the day 

has not jesus himself challenged us to this gentleness he even offers himself as model learn of me that am gentle of heart and you will find rest for your souls matthew 11 28 29 

and so let us learn like francis de
sales and mother aviat to turn all the little daily annoyances the traffic jam the delayed air flight the impatient clerk the lost keys into grace filled moments when our hearts turn briefly to god to calmly 
surrender all of this into his hands holding our hearts gently in his presence one step at time 
finding your niche 
what does it mean to be follower of jesus 
what is the state of life in which find myself 
what is the stage of life in which find myself 
how might be called to follow jesus at this point in my life 
how might be called to practice devotion at this point in my life 
how might the voice of god be speaking to me in the circumstances events and relationships of my every day life 
what do believe to be my niche at this point in my life 

god dream for you 
ray kinsella is the main character in the movie field of dreams 1989 whose world is turned upside down when he hears voice telling him if you build it he will come and build it he does that and so much more 
but near the end of the film it is 
someone else the character thomas mann who is asked to join the baseball players beyond the field ray is understandably upset and when he asks the ghost of shoeless joe jackson why he can join them the ghost 
simply but firmly responds you re not invited imagine how john the baptist must have felt as st francis de sales wrote john spent twenty five years in the desert without coming to see jesus even once then 
after baptizing jesus he does not get to follow him but stays behind to accomplish his appointed task stopp selected letters page 74 
all of us are called to follow jesus
but not in the same way john wasn invited to join jesus that invitation was extended to others john way of following jesus as it turned out was to stay home and to lead others to jesus 
to be sure all of us are called to follow jesus to live as christ lived however not all of us are called to follow jesus in the same way consider chapter nine of matthew gospel in one scene verse jesus heals 
paralytic telling him to pick up your mat and go home by contrast when he encounters matthew verse jesus says follow me 
using the language of the salesian tradition while all of us are called to live devout life each of us is called to do that in ways that fit the state and stage of life in which god has placed us in his 
introduction to the devout life francis
each of us is called to live devout life in ways that fit the state and stage of life in which god places us 
wrote devotion must be exercised in different ways by the gentleman the worker the servant the prince the widow the young girl and the married woman not only is this true but the practice of devotion must be 
adapted to the strength activities and duties of each particular person part one chapter 
in part two of the introduction francis observed among god servants some dedicate themselves to serve the sick others to help the poor others to spread knowledge of christian doctrine among children others to 
reclaim souls lost and gone astray others to beautify churches and decorate others others to restore peace and concord among other people 
to be sure some people are called to follow jesus by leaving behind all that is familiar some people are called to practice devotion by undertaking some special ministry half world away some people are called 
to follow jesus by giving their life for the gospel 

for most of us however following jesus is about staying home for most of us following jesus is about seeing all that is familiar with new eyes for most of us practicing devotion is about entering more deeply 
into our relationships with family neighbors coworkers and friends for most of us growing in our love for god and others is about lovingly tending to the fields of dreams which are the circumstances and events 
of everyday life 
in that respect the movie field of dreams is about finding your niche 
following jesus is about tending our own unique fields of dreams 
for one person it was about forsaking baseball for career in medicine for writer it was about venturing into the unknown to get the story of lifetime for another it was about growing in his love for his wife 
his daughter and the opportunity to be at peace with the spirit of his father 

francis de sales wrote we must stay in our own ship to make the journey from this life to the next stopp selected letters 251 for each of us following jesus is about finding our unique god given niche in life 
and sticking to it 
seasons of the soul 

how much change do experience in my life 
how comfortable am with change do deal well with change why 
do deal poorly with changes in my life are there any feelings or moods that find especg one day never exactly resembles another some days are cloudy some rainy some dry some windy variety gives great beauty 
to the universe ially frustrating or problematic why 
how much confidence and trust do have in god no matter how my heart is 
where might need to grow more comfortable with the seasons of my soul 
in what in whom do place my trust 

the need for confidence 
in the fourth book of his introduction to the devout life chapter 13 st francis de sales begins with the following observation god keeps this wonderful world in existence amidst constant change thus day passes 
into night spring into summer summer into autumn autumn into winter and winter into sprin
it is the same with us francis continues 
we are never in the same state our lives flow on earth like the water that surges and swirls in perpetual diversity of movements sometimes we are lifted up by hope sometimes cast down by fear
sometimes bent to the right by joys sometimes to the left by sorrow not one day nor one hour is exactly the same 
indeed how diverse how fluid and how varied are the seasons of the human heart of the human mind and of the human soul in so many ways heraclitus greek philosopher 500 was right when he said that the only 
constant is change 
these seasons of the soul challenge us in two ways 
we need to accept embrace and learn from all of the seasons of our lives 
and we nevertheless need to find some source of constancy in order to effectively deal with the changing tides of the ocean within us that is our thoughts feelings and attitudes 
st francis offered advice regarding the former in letter to st jane de chantal letters of spiritual direction 148 written in 1608 you would like it to be always spring or summer but no you have to experience 
interior as well as exterior changes only in heaven will everything be springtime as to beauty autumn as to enjoyment and summer as to love there will be no winter there but here below we need winter so that 
we may practice self denial and the countless small but beautiful virtues that can be practiced during barren season 
just as every season of the year plays in our particular role in god plan for our world so too all the seasons of the heart have their place to play in god plan of salvation for us joy sadness success setback 
faith fear anxiety confidence all can teach us something more of who we are and who god calls us to be 
who wouldn always like to be happy and fulfilled who wouldn like to avoid sadness and emptiness nevertheless every season of the soul has its own voice that needs to be heard 
where can we hope to find the stability to deal with the seasons of the soul francis de sales wrote we must try to keep constant and unchanging mind though everything turns and changes about us and within us 
we must always remain firm our eyes fixed on god seeking god and moving towards god whether we are in sadness or joy in consolation or bitterness in peace or in trouble in light or in darkness in temptation or 
tranquility in liking or disgust 
take confidence in god unchanging love for us 
in dryness or warmth scorched by the sun or refreshed by the dew yet the highest point of our heart like the compass of ship should always be turned to god our creator and our savior our unique and sovereign 
good 

our spiritual path may be filled with uncertainty god’ plan for us may be full of surprises some consoling some maddening our minds our hearts our lives may not be as calm or predictable as we might like 

the challenge for us is to believe that in all and every season of the soul it is the same loving god who creates us redeems us and inspires us to take confidence in god constant unchanging and eternal love 
for us 
the power 

which of the qualities of happy healthy and holy conversation above most appeal to you 
which of the qualities of happy healthy and holy conversation above least appeal to you 
which dimension do you believe you do the best 
which dimension do you believe you need to develop the most 
are there any you would add 
why or why not 
on scale of one to ten how would you rate your communication skills at this point in your life 

of words and mean spirit 

whether in public or private speak from your heart speak from your soul mild should it be necessary to contradict anyone or oppose another opinion we must do it in ways that do not inflame the other temper 
says francis de sales nothing is ever gained by harshness or again correction is naturally bitter but when mixed with the sugar of loving kindness and warmed by the 
fire of charity it becomes more acceptable gracious even cordial not a mess 

where you practice this gentleness is just as important as how when you need to correct someone it is better to put it off little and make the correction in private and with kindness observes 
st jane de chantal in addition do so without nagging 
whether in conflict or correction keep it short and sweet 
unaffected say what you mean mean what you say st jane de chantal writes let there be nothing in your manner of speaking or writing that smacks of affectation in truth 
would rather have you appear unskilled than be considered affected mess 

the more straightforward the better 
sincere say what needs to be said in as genuine manner as possible st francis de sales remarks fidelity plainness and sincerity of speech are assuredly great ornament of christian life  for st jane de chantal 

how do you strike the balance between your work and recreation 
how much time do you actually take each year each week each day to deal with tension to address your stress to prevent burnout 
how faithful are you to refreshing your body 
how faithful are you to refreshing your mind 
how faithful are you to refreshing your heart 
how faithful are you to refreshing your soul 
are there any changes that you need to make at this time in your life to have better balance between work and play 
no way 

all work and no play makes jack dull boy 
not only might it make jack dull it might cripple his attempts to be happy healthy and even holy 
make no mistake growing in holiness making real in our own lives the love of the god in whose image and likeness we are created is serious business  it requires hard work it requires discipline 
it is actually defect to be so strict austere and unsociable that one never permits oneself recreation time 
it requires self examination it requires commitment 
as francis de sales would say it requires devotion 
but salesian spirituality also recognizes the value of relaxation of taking time out of catching your breath of making time for play in fact relaxation is not only permissible it is necessary francis de sales 
claims it is actually defect to be so strict austere and unsociable that one neither permits oneself nor others any recreation time 
the introduction to the devout life 1609 contains ample evidence of the gentleman saint appreciation of the important role that recreation plays in the pursuit of fully human god centered life he says from 
time to time we must recreate in mind and body 
he continues to take the air to go for walk to enjoy friendly chat to play music or sing or hunt are such honest diversions that the only thing needed to utilize them well is simple prudence which gives to all 
things their rank time place and measure 
to be balanced we need to know our limitations st jane once wrote in the context of letter to member of her community must run for have little leisure and my arm and hand are starting to tire and hurt even 
though ve just begun to write not able to do as much as used to 
 from time to time we must recreate in mind and body 
in his book touching the ordinary robert wicks identifies practices that can help us establish and maintain balanced life get enough sleep eat right practice leisure pace yourself learn to laugh focus on 
values practice self appreciation be involved but not too involved have support group escape on occasion be spontaneous avoid negativity establish good friendships practice intimacy 
of course there are also the spiritual practices pray participate in the life of the church celebrate the sacraments read scripture and other material that nourishes the soul 
our lord jesus christ spent virtually his entire public ministry meeting the needs of others healing teaching feeding challenging forgiving in short working but the gospels that document christ work ethic also 
clearly document those times when he withdrew from his activities to rest to renew to enjoy an other hospitality to spend time with friends all helpful in rededicating himself to doing the will of god 
how faithful are you to refreshing your body mind heart and soul 
there are plenty of ways to achieve balance between work and play livelihood and leisure pay and play consider them in personal prayerful manner choose those consistent with the state and stage of life in 
which you find yourself at this time realize that as your life changes so too may your means for achieving this happy healthy and holy balance 

as you travel along the highway of life take your foot off the gas sometimes ride with the windows down pullover on occasion use the rest stop check out the scenic overlooks balancing work and play will not 
only help you to reach your destinations in one piece but it will actually enable you to really enjoy the trip 
anger 

what is your experience of anger 
are there situations or issues in your life that tap into your anger more than others if so what are they what steps might you take to understand why these things tend to push 
your buttons more readily than others 
how successful are you at naming and managing your anger 
what strategies might you employ for getting better handle on your anger 
are there any relationships in your life that have been damaged by anger are there any steps you can take to repair the damage 

volatile subject 

ever been angry of course you 
have anger is fact of life 
sometimes volatile fact of life 
like any emotion it cannot be denied or suppressed nor should it be recklessly unbridled it needs to be understood 
anger is not sinful  however how we deal with it or fail to deal with it can have sinful results 
it is better to attempt to find way to live without anger rather than pretend to make moderate or discreet use of it 
we seldom plan to grow angry anger is an intense response or reaction to an injury or injustice either actual or perceived as such it often catches us off guard 
herein lies the difficulty precisely because of its spontaneity and intensity anger can quickly get the upper hand…and get out of hand anger is as it were an uninvited guest that can quickly become the master 
of the house once admitted it is with difficulty driven out again it enters as little twig and in less than no time it grows big and becomes abeam 
francis de sales counsels us it is better to attempt to find way to live without anger rather than pretend to make moderate or discreet use of it as long as reason rules and peaceably exercises chastisements 
or corrections people can approve and receive them however when accompanied by anger or rage this same reason is feared rather than loved 

when it comes to anger don try to fight fire with fire 
 
jane de chantal suggests try to calm your passions and live according to sound reason and the holy will of god 
it is better to let anger cool before making decision or taking some action 
unbridled anger can be very destructive sometimes however the ways in which we react to being angry are worse than the anger itself many are greatly to blame who on being overcome by anger are angry for being 
angry in so doing they keep their hearts drenched and steeped in anger francis de sales continues it frequently happens that by endeavoring with violence to restrain our anger we stir up more trouble in our 
heart and being thus agitated the heart is no longer master of itself 
when is comes to anger don fight fire with fire 
still we all fail in this regard despite our best efforts we make decisions take actions and speak words in anger hurting others and ourselves in the process 
what can we do to repair the damage as soon as you perceive yourself guilty of an act of wrath repair it immediately by an act of kindness toward the person with whom you were angry as they say wounds are most 
easily cured when they are still fresh 
repeatedly indulging in anger can lead to tragic results when we brood over injuries when we revisit old hurts when we hold onto resentment anger ceases to be simply an emotion it becomes way of life 

avoid acting in anger avoid speaking in anger above all avoid wallowing in anger 

heed these words from the book of sirach wrath and anger are hateful things yet the sinner hugs them tight should person nourish anger against others and expect healing from the lord as stone falls back upon 

for holy living 

salesian spirituality is optimistic it affirms the innate god given dignity of each person it believes in the possibility of living happy healthy and holy life 
salesian spirituality is relational growing in holiness does not occur in vacuum rather striving for christian perfection always takes place within the context of our relationship with god ourselves and one 

blessed are hearts that bend for they shall never be broken 
fifth live in the present don dwell in the past don obsess about the future carpe diem that is seize today and master the moment to advance well st francis de sales recommends we must apply ourselves to make 
good way on the road nearest to us and to do today journey 
sixth roll with the punches pick your battles be steadfast on principle but flexible in detail blessed are hearts that bend observes st francis de sales for they shall never be broken 
seventh do little simple things well why wait for some one time opportunity to do one great thing and risk missing the countless opportunities each day to perform simpler ones with great attention passion and 
zeal we cannot always offer god great things says st jane de chantal but at each instant we can offer little things with great love 
eighth remain focused on your own happiness health and holiness you can give what you don have we can be so concerned about others welfare that we neglect our own st francis de sales 

we cannot always offer god 
great things but at each moment we can offer little things with great love 

cautions us do not sow crops of good intentions in your neighbor garden rather cultivate your own with diligence 
ninth strive for balance avoid extremes salt and sugar are both excellent things claims st francis de sales but too much of either spoils the dish food for thought 

finally make and maintain good friendships don be lone ranger seek out others in friendship who can support you encourage you understand you and challenge you in your desire to grow in happiness health and 
holiness the book of sirach 16 says it best faithful friend is the medicine of life and of immortality 
 
recalling god’ presence 

what are common occasions in which can achieve good on typical day 
what are some common occasions of temptation or sin for me on typical day 
how well do plan each day how well do remain centered in god presence when my plans for the day go awry 
am grateful for the times that am able to remember god presence throughout the day 
what are some ways that can recall god presence that fit into my daily routine 

throughout the day 

all this took place to fulfill what the lord had said through the prophet the virgin shall be with child and give birth to son and they shall call him immanuel name that means god with us matt 22 23 
immanuel god with us god who is always with us god who is with us all ways yet why is it that god sometimes seems so distant so illusive so remote does god forget us 
no god can never forget us however we can forget god…and we frequently do 

consider that god gives you this new day to bring you closer to eternity 

salesian spirituality offers us practical approach for recalling god presence throughout the day rather than look for god who dwells in faraway place this spiritual recollection us that god dwells precisely 
where we find ourselves in the rhythm of each day 
first upon waking embrace the gift of new day thanking god for having preserved you doing the preceding night 
second consider that god gives you this new day to bring you one step closer to eternity intend to make good use of this new day 
third foresee what business what affairs and what situations for serving god you will encounter on this day says st francis de sales and to what temptations of offending god you will be exposed in other words 
plan your day anticipate the opportunities that you will have for accomplishing some good be aware of those circumstances in which you may be tempted to do otherwise 
fourth resolve to do your best in embracing this new day both those experiences that 
 ask for god grace and make new start 
you anticipate and those that may surprise you acknowledge your need for god grace to accomplish good and to avoid evil this day 
fifth during the day retire into the solitude of your heart while you are outwardly engaged in business or association with others says francis de sales in short stay centered simple movements of the mind or
heart in the midst of any activity achieve this 
sixth make brief exanimation of conscience at midday are you living out your resolutions for living the day well ask for god grace to continue your efforts have you been less than successful so far ask for god 
grace and make anew start 
seventh make more detailed examination of conscience at the end of the day thank god for having preserved you during the day examine your actions and attitudes give thanks to god for what was good ask for 
forgiveness for that which was sinful 
finally ask god to protect you during the night to give you restful sleep and to help you embrace tomorrow with renewed enthusiasm and zeal 
as practical and powerful as these practices are you should not spend inordinate amounts of time upon them rather says st francis de sales they must be made briefly and fervently 
perhaps st jane de chantal best describes the kind of awareness and attitude that these practices seek to establish as for the will of god good pleasure which we know only through 
lovingly unite your will to the divine the events of life as they occur if these events benefit us we must bless god and unite ourselves to the divine will which sends them if something occurs which is 
disagreeable physically or mentally let us lovingly unite our will in obedience to the divine will which sends it 

by approaching the rhythms of each day with prayerful outlook and intention our daily triumphs and tragedies do not obscure the presence of god no they become the very places in which we encounter the divine 

disciplined life 

how flexible am 
in what areas of my life do experience or demonstrate the most flexibility 
in what areas of my life do experience or demonstrate the least flexibility 
how do react when things don go my way 
how adaptable am to changes in my life 
how good am at rolling with the punches 
in what areas of my life do need more discipline 

flexible life 
author scott peck md opens his book the road less traveled with simple yet universal truth 
life is difficult 
why what makes life difficult is that the process of confronting or dealing with life challenges is painful one challenges depending on their nature evoke in us frustration or grief or sadness or 
loneliness or guilt or regret or anger or fear or anxiety or anguish or despair 

discipline is the basic set of tools we require to deal 

since life poses an endless series of challenges life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy 
the temptation to avoid life challenges to turn away from opportunities for growth that can be found in grief or loss the desire to withdraw from the world the desire to withdraw from ourselves 
what do we need to counter this temptation 
discipline 
dr peck asserts discipline is the basic set of tools we require to deal with life challenges 
now be honest when you hear the word discipline you think rigid lock step inflexible right 
well time to expand your definition extraordinary flexibility is required for successful living in all spheres of activity health demands an extraordinary capacity to flexibly strike and continually restrike 
delicate balance between conflicting needs goals duties responsibilities et cetera 
successful people are those who are ready for anything both that for which they plan as well as that which is unexpected 
this is the essence of discipline it all about knowing when to take hold and when to let go ultimately it about knowing how to do both 
health happiness and holiness ultimately rely upon being disciplined enough to be extraordinarily flexible it is truly kind of freedom st francis de sales observes the effects of this freedom are great inner 

this interior discipline this rolling with the punches this willingness to deal with life on life terms not ours will make you grow in perfection and detachment more than you can imagine observes st jane de 
chantal 
she writes to friend who in fact chose to scrap something into which he had invested much time and energy believe that it was god who inspired you not to go on with your original plan in this assure you you 
have certainly followed the true spirit of our blessed father francis de sales for as you know he wished us to be courageous in our undertakings and flexible in letting them go when god in his good pleasure 
indicates that we should 
be courageous in your undertakings and flexible in letting them go… 
the words of country song come to mind you ve got to know when to hold em know when to fold em know when to walk away know  when to run 
what gift the ability to pursue what we have planned for life the ability to accept what life has planned for us the ability to do both 
that discipline that flexibility that freedom 
that very good news 
what is 
do you believe that you are good 
what does being holy look or feel like to you 
are there any dimensions of salesian spirituality as outlined in this brochure that you find particularly nourishing or attractive 
what aspects of salesian spirituality as outlined in this brochure do you find most challenging or confrontational 
how might god be calling you to live jesus at this stage of your life 
salesian spirituality 

it is way of living the gospel as learned lived and shared by st francis de sales 1567 1622 and st jane de chantal 1572 1641 its first disciples were the sisters of the visitation of holy mary community of 
contemplative women established by these two saints in 1610 their vision continues today lived by people of all walks states and stages of life one cannot hope to adequately plumb the depths of this 
spirituality in brief pamphlet what follows are some of the more salient features of salesian spirituality 
god is love and all creation is an outpouring of that love all creation has been made for christ with christ and through christ 
all creation should be treated with respect and care jesus is the model for all fully human living 
you possess divine dignity and are thus worthy of profound respect god has testified that you are good worthy of divine love and mercy 
despite your weakness and sinfulness god loves you so much that god sent his only son to become human 
you are called to be holy that is to grow in union with god 
pursuing holy life is called devotion that is doing what is both commanded and counseled by god promptly actively and diligently 
the pursuit of holiness must be practical it must transform your attitudes attributes and actions 
acknowledge your sins and failing learn from them but do not dwell on them 
god gives you talents and abilities gifts that should be discovered developed and used for the good of others 
relationships are essential to living fully human that is holy life 
each moment of each day comes from the hand of loving god and is graced for your salvation the only time you have is each present moment don live in the past don dwell on the future 
living each moment to the fullest with an eye to loving god must lead you to show compassion for others 
the challenge of each moment is discerning god will that is the particular unique way that god may be calling you to love god yourself and others god will is frequently communicated through the events 
circumstances and relationships in which you find yourself 
god seldom requires you to perform great or extraordinary feats 
god always challenges you to perform everyday actions with extraordinary attention and enthusiasm he little virtues of patience humility gentleness simplicity honesty and hospitality are powerful means for 
growing in holiness 
all prayer and meditation must lead to action 
the motivation with which you perform some action may be far more important and powerful than the action itself 
freedom is one of the most precious and powerful gifts that god gives you you are to use that freedom to grow in conformity to god will 
intellectual learning prayerful reflection social interaction work play and all things creative should be valued as graced by god and viewed as means for growing into fully human person each new day is anew 
beginning new opportunity for growing in holiness 
let your passion be disciplined 
let your discipline be passionate keep things in perspective 
develop sense of humor 

welcome to salesian spirituality 
may it help you to become holy whole human person may it enable you to live jesus to allow jesus to live in you and to love through you 
 
they shall possess the earth 
on scale of one to ten how gentle am 
how am tempted to overreact to things and people in life 
how am tempted to under react to things and people in life 
how gentle am in the face of my own sins faults and imperfections 
how gentle am in the face of others sins faults and imperfections 
how important or unimportant is it for me to get my way 
in what areas of my life might need to become more gentle 
do enjoy my life here on earth how aware and engaged am in each day hour and moment of life 
do treat myself and others with respect and reverence 

the gentle 
the sermon on the mount is the first of five great discourses in the gospel of matthew jesus begins this discourse with the well known beatitudes one of which is blessed are the gentle they shall inherit the 

about this virtue it is in fact one of the two great pillars of salesian spirituality drawn from the words of jesus who described himself as gentle humble of heart mt 11 29 
do not be over eager be careful to serve god with great gentleness for this is the right way of setting about god service do not want to do everything but only something and no doubt you will in fact do much 
how sweet is patience when compared with revenge gentleness compared with anger and vexation humility when compared with arrogance and ambition wrote st francis de sales gentleness perfects us with respect to 
 our neighbor it stands out among all the virtues as the flower of charity introduction to the devout life part chapter 11 part iii chapter 
this gentleness this respect this reverence for ourselves and others is rooted in humility which in turn is rooted in our relationship with god profound humility toward god should produce gentleness toward our 
 neighbors this in turn should foster kindliness of heart we should accommodate ourselves to others restraining our vigor to suit the pace of others conferences xiii pp 240 242 
the acid test of our gentleness is how we respond 0r react when others injure us if we are proud puffed up and enraged when we are stung and bitten by detractors and enemies it is sure sign that neither 
humility nor gentleness are genuine in us but only apparent and artificial introduction part iii chapter 
being gentle is about living with purpose and direction in ways that avoid both passivity and aggression either with regard to ourselves or others francis wrote do not be over eager be careful to serve god 
with great gentleness for this is the right way of setting about god service do not want to do everything but only something and no doubt you will in fact do much selected letters 135 
gentleness is rooted in humility in our relationship with god 
how does this enable us to inherit the earth by being gentle by being self disciplined by being self possessed we are better able to respond to life rather than react to it we can then truly take hold of lif find ourselves e 
as it is now and dream of how it might be with god grace in the days to come

upon them with strong hope that as they arise god whose child you are will 
deliver you from them 

just trust in him and he will continue to lead you safely through all things where 
you cannot walk he will carry you in his arms 

do not look forward to what may happen tomorrow the same everlasting father 
who cares for you today will take care of your tomorrow and every day either he 
will shield you from suffering or he will give you unfailing strength to bear it 

be at peace then and put aside all anxious thoughts 

take courage and turn troubles which you cannot remedy into material for 
progress and maturity 

think often of the lord for he will enable you to bear your troubles patiently all 
troubles will be powerless to move you if you only remember that you have such 
friend 

do everything calmly and peacefully do as much as you can as well as you can 

strive to see god in all things without exception and consent to his will joyously 
do everything for god uniting yourself to him in word and deed 

walk very simply with the cross of the lord and be at peace with yourself you 
shall steer safely through every storm so long as your trust is fixed on god 

do not lose your inner peace for anything whatsoever not even if your whole
world seems upset if you find that you have wandered away from the shelter of
god lead your heart back to him quietly and simply 

do all things in the name of god and you will do all things well whether you eat 
or drink work or sleep you will profit greatly before god by doing all these things 
as god wants them done 

whatsoever happens never let go hold steadfastly to god in peace trusting his 
everlasting love for you 
 
love for you 
 you

sample files you can download sample files that relate to excerpts from microsoft office excel 2003 inside out
from microsoft office online  this article uses the file treeorders xls 
although microsoft excel includes a multitude of built-in worksheet functions  chances are it doesn't have a
function for every type of calculation you perform  excel's designers couldn't possibly anticipate every calculation
need of every user  but they did provide you with the ability to create your own custom functions  in the same way
that a macro lets you encapsulate a sequence of actions execute that sequence with a single command  a
custom function lets you encapsulate a sequence of calculations so that you can perform those calculations with
a single formula 
custom functions  like macros  use the visual basic for applications  vba  programming language  they differ
from macros in two significant ways  first  they use function procedures instead of sub procedures  they start
with a function statement instead of a sub statement and end with end function instead of end sub  second 
they perform calculations instead of taking actions  certain kinds of statements  such as statements that select
and format ranges  are excluded from custom functions  in this article  you learn how to create and use custom
functions 
getting started
suppose your company offers a quantity discount of 10 percent on the sale of a product  provided the order is for
more than 100 units  in the following paragraphs  you'll build a function to calculate this discount 
figure 1 shows an order form that lists each item  the quantity  the price  the discount  if any   and the resulting
extended price

figure 1  in column f  we want to calculate the discount for each item ordered 
note the workbook used in this example  treeorders xls  is included in the sample files download 
to create a custom discount function in this workbook  follow these steps 
press alt+f11 to open the visual basic editor  vbe   and then choose insert  module  a new module
appears  as shown in figure 2 
1 
in the new module  enter the following code  to make the code more readable  use the tab key to indent
lines   the indentation is for your benefit only and is entirely optional  the code will run with or without
indentation   after you type an indented line  the vbe assumes that your next line will be similarly indented  to
move back out  that is  to the left  one tab character  press shift+tab 
2 
function discount quantity  price 
if quantity >= 100 then
discount = quantity   price   0 1
else
discount = 0
end if
discount = application round discount  2 
end function
figure 2  choosing insert  module adds a new module to the workbook 
using custom functions
now you're ready to use the new discount function  press alt+f11 to switch back to the worksheet shown in
figure 2  select cell f9 and enter =discount c9 d9   excel calculates the 10 percent discount on 200 units at
$47 50 per unit and returns $950 00

http //office microsoft com/en-us/excel-help/creating-custom-functions-ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
in the first line of your vba code  function discount quantity  price   you indicated that the discount function
would require two arguments  quantity and price  when you call the function in a worksheet cell  you must include
those two arguments  in the formula =discount c9 d9   c9 is the quantity argument  and d9 is the price
argument  now you can copy the discount formula into f10 f15 to get the worksheet shown in figure 3 
figure 3  this worksheet shows the result of the discount custom function 
what's happening
let's consider how excel interprets this function procedure  when you press enter  excel looks for the name
discount in the current workbook and finds that it is a procedure in module1  the argument names enclosed in
parentheses—quantity and price—are placeholders for the values on which the calculation of the discount is
based 
the if statement in the following block of code examines the quantity argument and determines whether the
number of items sold is greater than or equal to 100 
if quantity >= 100 then
discount = quantity   price   0 1
else
discount = 0
end if
if the number of items sold is greater than or equal to 100  vba executes the following statement  which
multiplies the quantity value by the price value and then multiplies the result by 0 1 
discount = quantity   price   0 1
the result is stored as the variable discount  a vba statement that stores a value in a variable is called an
assignment statement  because it evaluates the expression on the right side of the equal sign and assigns the
result to the variable name on the left  because the variable discount has the same name as the function
procedure  the value stored in the variable is returned to the worksheet formula called the discount function 
if quantity is less than 100  vba executes the statement
discount = 0
finally  the following statement rounds the value assigned to the discount variable to two decimal places 
discount = application round discount  2 
vba has no round function  but excel does  therefore  to use round in this statement  you tell vba to look for
the round method  function  in the application object  excel   you do that by adding the word application before
the word round  use this syntax whenever you need to access an excel function from a vba module

understanding custom function rules
a custom function must start with a function statement and end with an end function statement  in addition to
the function name  the function statement usually specifies one or more arguments  you may include as many as
29 arguments  using commas to separate them  you can also create a function with no arguments  excel
includes several built-in functions—rand   and now    for example—that don't use arguments  as you'll see
later in this chapter  you can also create functions with optional arguments—arguments that you can either
include or omit when you call the function 
following the function statement  a function procedure includes one or more vba statements that make
decisions and perform calculations using the arguments passed to the function  finally  somewhere in the
function procedure  you must include a statement that assigns a value to a variable with the same name as the
function  this value is returned to the formula that calls the function 
using vba keywords in custom functions
the number of vba keywords you can use in custom functions is smaller than the number you can use in
macros  custom functions are not allowed to do anything other than return a value to a formula in a worksheet or
to an expression used in another vba macro or function  for example  custom functions cannot resize windows 
edit a formula in a cell  or change the font  color  or pattern options for the text in a cell  if you include  action 
code of this kind in a function procedure  the function returns the #value! error 
the one action a function procedure can take  apart from performing calculations  is to display a dialog box  you
can use an inputbox statement in a custom function as a means of getting input from the user executing the
function  you can use a msgbox statement as a means of conveying information to the user  you also can use
custom dialog boxes  or userforms—a subject that is beyond the scope of this introduction 
documenting macros and custom functions
even simple macros and custom functions can be difficult to read  you can make them easier to understand by
entering explanatory text in the form of comments  you add comments by preceding the explanatory text with an
apostrophe  for example  figure 4 shows the discount function with comments  adding comments like these
makes it easier for you or others to maintain your vba code as time passes  if you need to make a change to the
code in the future  you'll have an easier time understanding what you did originally 
figure 4  the discount custom function now includes comments 
an apostrophe tells excel to ignore everything to the right on the same line  so you can place a comment to the
right of a vba statement  you can also insert comments between the statements in a macro or custom function 
for example  you might begin a relatively long block of code with a comment that explains its overall purpose and
then use inline comments to document individual statements 
another way to document your macros and custom functions is to give them descriptive names  for example 
rather than name a macro labels  you could name it relmonthlabels  where rel indicates that the macro uses
relative references and monthlabels describes the type of label the macro creates  using descriptive names for
macros and custom functions is especially helpful when you've created many procedures  particularly if you
create procedures that have similar  but not identical  purposes 
creating custom functions - excel - office com page 4 of 6
http //office microsoft com/en-us/excel-help/creating-custom-functions-ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
how you document your macros and custom functions is a matter of personal preference  it doesn't matter which
method you use  as long as you document them  documentation is most important for long and complex
procedures  for procedures that you look at only once in a while  and for procedures that will be maintained by
other people 
creating custom functions with optional arguments
some of excel's built-in functions let you omit certain arguments  for example  if you omit the type and future
value arguments from the pv function  excel still computes the result because those arguments are optional 
your custom functions can also make use of optional arguments 
for example  suppose you want to create a custom function called righttriangle that uses the pythagorean
theorem to compute the length of any side of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides  the
equation that expresses the pythagorean theorem is a2 + b2 = c2  in which a and b are the short sides and c is
the hypotenuse  given any two sides  you can use this equation to solve for the third side 
in a general-purpose triangle function  you want to accept three arguments  one for each side of the triangle  but
make each argument optional so that the user of the function can omit the argument that the function should
solve for  the following code does the trick 
function triangle optional side1  optional side2  _
optional hypotenuse 
if not ismissing side1   and not  ismissing side2   then
triangle = sqr side1 ^ 2 + side2 ^ 2 
else
if not ismissing side1   and not ismissing hypotenuse   then
triangle = sqr hypotenuse ^ 2 - side1 ^ 2 
else
if not ismissing side2   and not ismissing hypotenuse   then
triangle = sqr hypotenuse ^ 2 - side2 ^ 2 
else
triangle =  please supply two arguments  
end if
end if
end if
end function
the first statement names the custom function and the optional arguments side1  side2  and hypotenuse  the
following block of code contains a series of if statements that use the vba ismissing function to test whether each
possible pair of arguments has been supplied and to calculate and return the length of the unknown side 
if not ismissing side1   and not  ismissing side2   then
triangle = sqr side1 ^ 2 + side2 ^ 2 
this code tests for the presence of side1 and side2  the ismissing function returns true if the argument has not
been supplied  if side1 is not missing and side2 is not missing  excel computes the square root of the sum of the
squares of the two short sides and returns the length of the hypotenuse to the worksheet 
if fewer than two arguments are supplied  the following statement returns a text string to the worksheet 
triangle =  please supply two arguments  
now let's see what happens when we use this custom function in a worksheet formula  the formula =triangle
 3 4  returns 5 
the hypotenuse argument is omitted  so the function returns the square root of  32 + 42   you could also write
the formula =triangle 3 4    but the second comma is not necessary  the formula =triangle  4 5  returns 3
because the side1 argument is omitted  the formula =triangle  4  5  also returns 3 
the function as written has at least two flaws  first  if the user supplies all three arguments  the function behaves
as though the third argument were omitted  you might prefer to have it return an error message  second  the

http //office microsoft com/en-us/excel-help/creating-custom-functions-ha001111701 aspx 10/5/2012
function accepts negative and zero arguments even though triangles cannot have sides of negative or zero
length 
you can eliminate the first of these defects by adding the following if … end if block immediately after the
function statement 
if not ismissing side1   and not ismissing side2   and _
not ismissing hypotenuse   then
triangle =  please supply only two arguments  
exit function
end if
note that this block includes an exit function statement  this saves the function the trouble of searching for
missing argument when it has already discovered that none are missing 
you can use a similar if … end if construction to check for arguments less than or equal to zero  returning an
appropriate error message and exiting the function if any are found  note that other kinds of inappropriate
arguments  text  for example  will cause the function to return one of excel's built-in error constants  if you call the
function and offer a text argument  the function returns #value! because it attempts to perform arithmetic
operations on a nonarithmetic value 
how much error trapping you add to your custom functions depends  of course  on how much work you want to
do and how you plan to use the function  if you're writing a function for your personal use  you might not need to
deal with every conceivable aberrant use  if you write the function for others  you'll probably want to eliminate all
possibility of error—or at least to try to do so 
making your custom functions available anywhere
to use a custom function  the workbook containing the module in which you create the function must be open  if
that workbook is not open  you get a #name? error when you try to use the function  even if the workbook is
open  if you use the function in a different workbook  you must precede the function name with the name of the
workbook in which the function resides  for example  if you create a function called discount in a workbook called
personal xls  and you call that function from another workbook  you must write =personal xls!discount    not
simply =discount   
you can save yourself some keystrokes  and possible typing errors  by selecting your custom functions from the
insert function dialog box   your custom functions appear in the user defined category   an easier way to make
your custom functions available at all times is to store them in a separate workbook and then save that workbook
as an add-in  an xla file  in your xlstart folder   the xlstart folder is a subfolder of the folder containing your
excel files  when you start excel  the program opens any documents it finds in xlstart   to save a workbook as
an add-in  choose file  save as  or file  save   then choose microsoft excel add-in from the files of type
list 
if your user-defined functions are stored in an xla file that is present in memory  you don't have to specify the
name of that file when you call a function  if the xla file is saved in your xlstart folder  it will be present in
memory whenever you run excel

introduction
high-speed commercial aircraft require a surface treatment for titanium  ti  alloy that is
both environmentally safe and durable under the conditions of supersonic flight  a
number of pretreatment procedures for ti alloy requiring multi-stages have been
developed to produce a stable surface  among the stages are  degreasing  mechanical
abrasion  chemical etching  and electrochemical anodizing  these treatments exhibit
significant variations in their long-term stability  and the benefits of each step in these
processes still remain unclear  in addition  chromium compounds are often used in many
chemical treatments and these materials are detrimental to the environment  recently  a
chromium-free surface treatment for ti alloy has been reported [1]  though not designed
for high temperature applications  in the present study  a simple surface treatment process
developed at nasa/larc [2] is reported  offering a high performance surface for a
variety of applications  this novel surface treatment for ti alloy is conventionally
achieved by forming oxides on the surface with a two-step chemical process without
mechanical abrasion  this acid-followed-by-base treatment was designed to be cost
effective and relatively safe to use in a commercial application  in addition  it is
chromium-free  and has been successfully used with a sol-gel coating to afford a strong
adhesive bond after exposure to hot-wet environments  phenylethynyl containing
adhesives were used to evaluate this surface treatment with sol-gel solutions made of
novel imide silanes developed at nasa/larc [3]  oxide layers developed by this
process were controlled by immersion time and temperature and solution concentration 
the morphology and chemical composition of the oxide layers were investigated using
scanning electron microscopy  sem   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  xps   and
auger electron spectroscopy  aes   bond strengths made with this new treatment were
evaluated using single lap shear tests 
experimental
the adherends of primary interest in this study were ti-6al-4v alloy  there were two
types  shiny and dark ti-6-4  the former was cleaner and processed with shorter
annealing time  15 min at 788ûc  than the latter  45 min at 788ûc   other metals studied
included aluminum and stainless steel  acetone and methanol were used as solvents for
degreasing for all the metals  alumina grit-blast and alkaline peroxide solution  1m
h2o2á0 5m naoh  were used to prepare reference specimens  the materials for the new
acid-base process were sulfuric acid solution  9m h2so4  and alkaline perborate
solution  0 5m nabo3á1m naoh  as the acid etchant and oxidizing agent  respectively 
sol-gel solutions were prepared prior to acid-base treatment [3]  peti-5áapeis/teos
and ppeids were used as the sol-gel solutions  dipping was used for each treatment 
first  after solvent degreasing  the sulfuric acid was used to generate a fresh ti surface 
next  an alkaline perborate solution was used to form an oxide on the surface  ultrasonic
washing in distilled water was used between each treatment  dipping time for each acid
and base treatment was varied in order to develop various surface morphologies  the
principal dipping time was 10 min  the sequence of the acid and base treatment was also
varied  for examples  acid-base and base-acid-base sequences were tried  a sol-gel
solution was applied to the pretreated metals for 3 min immediately after drying them in
an oven at 100ûc for 10 min  the sol-gel coated metals were placed in the oven at 110
and 220ûc for 30 min each 
single lap shear specimens were bonded at 371ûc under 50 psi for an hour using a
phenylethynyl containing imide adhesive tape  fm-x5  cytec   bond strengths of the lap
shear specimens were tested using astm d1002  an sem  jms-6400   xps  5400-
xps   and aes  610 scanning auger system  were used to analyze the surface
morphology and chemical composition  polished sections of the ti-6-4 alloys in an epoxy
molding resin were used for edx and x-ray mapping study using the sem 
results and discussion
fig  1 shows lap shear strengths for the specimens treated with the alkaline peroxide  rt
for 10 min  subsequent to the mechanical abrasion  while the rt strength with only gritblast
did not exhibit resistance in the hot wet environment  those with additional alkaline
peroxide treatment raised both initial and hot-wet strengths significantly  this helps to
prove the efficacy of using an oxidizing agent  alkaline peroxide  to develop a durable
oxide layer against hostile environments  although mechanical abrasion is desirable to
produce a rough and fresh surface  there is a limit for this application to complex
substrates  so that mechanical abrasion was replaced by sulfuric acid etching  in addition 
alkaline peroxide was replaced by alkaline perborate to produce a safe and stable
oxidizing agent  perborate  eventually liberates hydrogen peroxide at temperatures up to
60ûc  lap shear strengths with grit-blast/alkaline peroxide and sulfuric acid/alkaline
perborate treatments are compared in fig  2  the strengths are almost the same for both
treatments  although the new acid-base treatment exhibits slightly better resistance in the
hot-wet environment  lap shear strengths for grit-blast/pasa-jell treatment with a
phenylethynyl containing adhesive  peti-5  have also been reported  which were 7110
psi rt strength and 5950 psi rt strength after a 3-day water-boil [4]

ti-6-4 alloy specimens subjected to the acid-base treatment with a variation in
time and temperature were analyzed using microscopy  acid etching was fairly effective
in degreasing tacky contaminants  and the degree of degreasing was proportional to
etching time according to optical microscopy examination  it was difficult  however  to
quantify the degree of etching due to the intrinsic non-uniform contamination of the
metal  on the other hand  base treatment as an oxidizing agent was very successful in
developing a fresh oxide layer  the thickness of the oxide layer increased with both time
and temperature  round platelets  < 2µm in diameter  with a broad size distribution were
developed during the base treatment  the shape and size of the platelets were most likely
dependent on the processing conditions of the ti alloys such as heat treatment  rolling 
and cleaning  the shiny ti-6-4 treated with the alkaline perborate at rt 10 min produced
what appeared to be a single layer of the platelets with the periphery being more angular
compared to the dark ti-6-4  which formed thicker and more round platelets  the role of
the shape  size  and thickness of the platelets remains unknown  a surface having a thick
oxide layer usually affords a thinner sol-gel coating compared to a nominal mono-layer
oxide surface  this thicker oxide layer results in lower strengths  essentially  the same
trend was observed with temperature variation  higher temperature  60ûc  tended to
develop a non-uniform  multi-layer oxide because perborate dissociates very rapidly into
hydrogen peroxide at 60ûc to become more reactive than at125 rt  a 60ûc treatment of
the dark ti-6-4 afforded 4254 psi rt strength and 4034 psi rt strength after a 3-day
water-boil  this was almost 40% lower strength than for the shiny  cleaner  ti-6-4 
analyzing these data  a 10 min exposure at rt in the perborate/base was selected as an
optimum condition 
aes depth profile revealed an oxygen peak at the interface between the metal and
sol-gel layer  probably representing a fresh oxide layer developed during base treatment 
the thickness was less than 200 nm based on aes  which corresponds to the value from
sem  ca  150 nm   this oxygen peak was also observed at an edx line map of a metal
treated by the alkaline perborate solution at rt for 10 min as shown in fig  4  x-ray
mapping of a metal treated by an acid-base process  rt for 10 min  illustrated that the
aluminum composition slightly increased while the titanium and vanadium vanished
rapidly at the outermost metal surface  this is seen in fig  5  from which the interface of
the al map appeared distinct compared to the diffusive interfaces of the rest of the
sample  this observation was further supported by edx line mapping  it is speculated
that an oxide layer developed by the alkaline perborate has aluminum compounds such as
aluminum oxides which may provide a more durable interface after being chemically
bonded with silane groups of the sol gel layer

the acid-base pretreatment was also employed for other metals including
aluminum and stainless steel again using the 15% peti-5áapeis/teos primer/coupling
agent  single lap shear specimens were prepared and tested  an example of the tested
aluminum specimen is shown in fig  6  failure occurred in the metal rather than in the
joint  giving 3314 psi with significant  permanent joint deformation

conclusions
a simple surface pretreatment process for ti-6-4 alloy was developed at nasa/larc to
meet requirements of high-speed commercial aircraft application  this process may offer
both environmentally safe and durable bonding at low cost under the conditions of
supersonic flight  this novel surface treatment for ti alloy is conventionally achieved
with a two-step chemical process without mechanical abrasion  in addition  it is
chromium-free and has been successfully used with a sol gel coating to afford a strong
adhesive bond  it exhibits excellent durability for hot wet environments with
approximately 90% retention of initial strengths  an oxide layer developed by this base
treatment can be controlled by time  temperature  and concentration  the morphology and
chemical composition of the oxide layer was investigated which revealed formation of
aluminum oxide compounds  it is expected that this process will establish a low cost and
high performance surface for not only high-speed commercial aircraft but also for other
commercial applications with any metal adherend

guide to etching specialty alloys 
specialty alloys with high resistance to corrosion have challenged many laboratories to refine the way they etch alloy samples for microstructural evaluation the big problem is that the 
alloys resist the etchants just as they do the corrosive conditions encountered in service 
katharine b small david a englehart and todd a christman  
carpenter technology corp wyomissing pennsylvania 
e
etching superalloys in preparation for microscopic examination is extremely challenging because of their inherent corrosion resistance over the years carpenter engineers have developed 
guidelines for the most effective procedures for etching a wide range of iron nickel and cobaltbase alloy systems the following discussion offers guidelines for processing stainless steels 
high temperature alloys tool and alloy steels and magnetic and expansion alloys 
etchant selection selection of the proper etchant depends largely upon alloy composition heat treatment and processing the etchants for metallographic examination are solutions of acids and 
other chemicals that are applied selectively to attack a highly polished surface thus permitting microstructural examination three basic methods have been developed to etch alloy samples 
immersion the sample is immersed in the etching solution until the preferred structure is developed samples may be immersed in stain etchants to highlight specific microstructural features 
swabbing the sample is swabbed with cotton that has been immersed in the etchant electrolytic etching a dc source or a rectifier serves as the power supply and the specimen acts as the 
anode in the electrolytic cell power requirements can be adjusted as needed  member of asm international 
depending on sample size anodetocathode spacing and electrolyte etchant rules 
the following rules should be observed to reveal a true and representative microstructure 
1
 if the specimen is mounted an adherent mount is very important separation between the specimen and the mounting compound can result in bleeding of the residual etchant or water and subsequent staining 2 
a good metallographic polish is a must the sample must be free of scratches disturbed metal and any kind of embedded contaminants 3
 the specimen must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before etching oil and any polishing compounds must be removed 4 
after etching the sample should be rinsed in hot water followed by an alcohol rinse and should then be dried under hot air note an alcohol rinse can dull wash out a stain etch samples 
with cracks must be thoroughly dried to prevent bleeding 5
 if additional etching time is required the specimen should be rerubbed for a few seconds on a final polishing wheel if this is not done flashing can develop in certain alloys necessitating 
a complete repolish however flashing does not develop and rerubbing is not required if the alloy being etched forms no passive oxide layer or if the specimen is etched electrolytically 
rerubbing is usually mandatory only with alloys requiring the use of ralph’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia and hcl + h2o2 etchants morecomplete specimen preparation instructions are readily 
available in the literature etchants and alloys 
table 1 lists 28 common etchants along with their compositions and guidelines table 2 lists various specialty alloys suggested etchants for each and application notes these tables can 
help you to quickly select the appropriate etching procedure for a particular alloy additional etchants are reported in astm specification e40799 standard practice for microetching metals 
and alloys and asm metals handbook volume 9 metallography and microstructures  advanced materials & processes february 2008 this photomicrograph shows the microstructure of a sample of 
type 330 stainless steel in the annealed condition at 100x magnification it was etched using a tint etch consisting of a solution of 40 ml hydrochloric acid hcl + distilled water h2o + 
one gram potassium meta bisulfite k2s2o5

pyrowear® 675 10 general structure the etchants for each alloy are presented in order of preference as the result of experience in general the most benign etchant is shown first followed by 
progressively more aggressive formulations if a weaker etchant is tried first and it does not yield satisfactory results the investigator need only buff the surface slightly to return a good 
polish for examination with a stronger etchant 
on the other hand if the first etchant attempted is too strong far more preparation is required to restore the surface to a workable condition therefore it is usually good practice to start 
with the weakest solution 
reasons for etching 
if the intent is to evaluate nonmetallic inclusions and sulfide distribution morphology the sample is best examined in the aspolished condition the reason is that etching can remove various 
inclusions and attack structures such as ferrite stringers in an austenitic matrix 
however if the search is designed to examine grain structure precipitation or coldwork deadvanced materials & processes february 2008

formation the sample must be etched 
the condition of an alloy and its heat treatment also must be considered in the selection and application of etchants therefore even if the alloy grade and analysis are known it is 
important to know whether it has been annealed aged cold worked tempered and or is in the ashardened condition 
corrosionresistant alloys 
special techniques are required to effectively prepare highly corrosion resistant alloys for microstructural examination prominent in this group are alloys such as biodur ccm plus 
alloy mp35n alloy mp35n is a registered trademark of sps technologies inc and custom age 625 plus alloy uns n07716  
because these nickelbase and cobaltbase alloys have superior corrosion resistance they should be etched with waterless kalling’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia or ralph’s if these do not 
work hcl + h2o2 may be suitable in any case these alloys usually should be etched slowly 
all require a fresh polish to avoid flashing which would require a complete repolish best results are achieved by lightly rerubbing one or two samples at a time on the final polishing 
wheel normally a 005micron alumina slurry  
the challenge with these alloys is to offset their natural tendency to selfpassivate rapidly in the presence of oxygen therefore to effectively process these grades specimens must be etched 
immediately after final polishing they should be rinsed dried and etched without delay 
when etching these highly resistant alloys the etchant should be prepared in advance of the polishing process this advance planning will minimize the length of time between polishing and 
etching thus permitting a more effective microstructural evaluation 
stainless steels duplex structures are to be examined then glyc
austenitic ferritic precipitation hardenable eregia should be applied and for a shorter time and martensitic stainless steels should be etched ferritic ralph’s reagent normally provides 
with various reagents to reveal features of interest a good etch for general structures in ferritic stain

tains few grain boundary precipitates  dic illuscratches may still be visible they may or may mination better shows the grain structure and not be a problem helps find coldwork deformation 
waterless precipitation hardenable ralph’s is usually kalling’s reagent reveals the general structure best for the precipitation hardenable stainless of many austenitic stainless alloys 
steels  however vilella’s reagent will work fine if 
other agents such as glyceregia or acetic glyca light etch is preferred etching time varies beeregia may be required to reveal retained ferrite cause the alloy in the aged condition reacts 
more and carbide precipitation quickly to the etchant the higher the aging tem

microscopy methods five light microscopy methods of illumination are suitable for microstructural examination table 3 
 brightfield illumination 
 darkfield illumination 
 oblique illumination 
 differential interferencecontrast dic 
 polarized light 
dic using brightfield microscopes that change the way light is deflected gives a threedimen
sional image the brightfield image is changed by inserting a beam splitting prism polarizer + analyzer to separate and recombine the image to provide a threedimensional effect 
this is the ultimate in light optical microscopy showing grain boundaries very clearly in highly 
corrosionresistant alloys it is the most effective means of showing relief in structures and is capable of identifying the effects of cold work and mechanical damage compared with the other 
methods dic provides increased image contrast the wellequipped laboratory should have all 
five because their capabilities are complementary their role in microstructural evaluation cannot 
be overestimated darkfield oblique and differential interferencecontrast illumination methods can aid in delineating grain boundaries and other microstructural features that are only weakly visible in bright 
field illumination a polarizing filter can be used in conjunction with a stain etch to enhance color 
contrast in darkfield microscopy the grain seen is dark and the grain boundaries light with the bright
field microscope the grain is light and the boundaries dark oblique illumination shines light at an 
angle on the surface producing shadows on microstructural features 
table 3 — light optical microscopy methods 
method description 
brightfield illumination the most commonly encountered method of illumination in which the light reflection 
is perpendicular to the specimen being viewed generally microstructural features such 
as grain boundaries are dark and matrix regions are bright 
darkfield illumination the light is obliquely reflected back through the objective so that what appears bright 
and dark in brightfield illumination is reversed in darkfield illumination 
oblique illumination the illustration source is decentered at an oblique angle producing shadows on 
microstructural features this method is extremely helpful if the operator knows the 
illumination direction  thereby knowing which features are raised and which are recessed 
by the shadow orientation 
differential a beamsplitting prism polarizer and analyzer are inserted into the light path producing 
interferencecontrast shadowing variations that reveal height differences in the microstructural features 
 dic 
polarized light the light is passed through a polarizing filter and can be adjusted to enhance the color 
contrast obtained with stain etchants 
36 advanced materials & processes february 2008 time or a less aggressive etchant for a longer time for example ralph’s reagent would etch in a few seconds or vilella’s which is less 
aggressive would etch more slowly 
martensitic vilella’s reagent is preferred for martensitic stainless steels etching time and response vary depending on whether the alloy has been annealed hardened or tempered annealed 
samples usually require the longest etching time because everything is in solution with not much to be seen 
it is best to stop etching while the specimen is still on the light side etching has gone too long when the sample starts going black a little experience will help the examiner to stop 
etching at the right time hardened and tempered samples usually require less etching time than annealed stock 
hightemperature alloys 
etching procedures for hightemperature alloys can vary greatly depending on condition of the material and what type of evaluation is required hightemperature alloys are typically more difficult 
to etch than austenitic stainless steels because they exhibit different aging conditions with a range of aging responses phases and precipitates 
if uncertain about which etchant to use start with glyceregia and increase in severity until the required structure is revealed this procedure requires only the final polishing step between etchants 
instead of a complete repolish glyceregia should be mixed at time of use as it becomes more aggressive with the passage of time 
waterless kalling’s another choice works well with alloys such as waspaloy uns n07001  pyromet alloy 718 uns n07718  and pyromet alloy a286 uns k66286  it can be stored and is thus more convenient than glyceregia 
stain etchants and electrolytic etchants can show specific aspects of structure in hightemperature alloys stain etchants used with immersion techniques have been effective in highlighting structural 
features such as second phases 
if the etchants for hightemperature alloys do not work hcl + h2o2 may be suitable just as they are for stainless steels precipitation can be evaluated via brightfield microscopy but dic is better for 
showing grain structure 
other alloy families 
tool and alloy steels nital 2 to 5% is useful for showing carbide structure in tool and alloy steels but reetching the treated sample afterward with vilella’s darkens the matrix and provides a 
clearer view of the microstructure many times samples can be etched with nital examined and then etched with vilella’s without repolishing alloy condition will determine etching time 
magnetic and expansion alloys most magnetic and expansion alloys can be treated as suggested for one of the stainless steel families or the tool and alloy steels for example nife alloys should be 
prepared by the procedures for austenitic stainless steels many of the alloys exploited for their dc magnetic properties such as stainless type 430f can be etched via procedures for ferritic 
stainless steels others such as fe and si core irons can be etched like low alloy steels with nital 
general tips some etchants such as waterless kalling’s can be made in bulk and stored other reagents such as glyceregia and acetic glyceregia must be prepared each time they are needed both glyceregia 
solutions undergo a continuous chemical reaction as they age becoming very aggressive in less than one hour special care must be taken then because the aggressive solution can affect etching time and 
procedure generally it is a good idea to use the solution as soon as possible after mixing 
as shown in tables 1 and 2 many different etchants can be successful for specific alloys and special circumstances when examining basic microstructure however the choice of reagent does not have to be 
difficult 
with a little experience and a good understanding of what features need to be evaluated the examiner may find that a few etchants will serve the intended purpose the majority of the time in order of 
increasing strength those etchants are nital villelas ralph’s glyceregia acetic glyceregia waterless kalling’s and hydrochloric acid + hydrogen peroxide 
health and safety 
all the referenced etchants are designed to attack the surface of the steels and alloys being analyzed therefore all the etchants contain chemicals that are hazardous to handle store use and discard 
the user of these etchants is responsible for developing appropriate procedures to address all hazardous aspects as required by appropriate health safety and environmental practices and regulations 
individual chemical material safety data sheets msds should be consulted as a starting source for information users are further cautioned that mixtures of the individual chemicals may result in different 
and possibly more significant risks which they are obliged to assess prior to application standard etchant texts contain additional safety and use information

bmi resin infusion material descriptions raptor resins supplies several varieties of bmi resins bmi1 is a tacky semisolid material at room temperature it can be crushed into a powder but the particles 
are tacky and will sinter together at temperatures above 60ºf the resin can be melted and poured at temperatures above 160ºf it is quite fluid at 200ºf at 275ºf the viscosity is typically 35 centipoise 
the resin is not very reactive until temperatures exceed 275ºf thus bmi1 is a very high flow resin well suited to liquid infusion in an oven or autoclave a minimum cure temperature is 350ºf with a post 
cure or 375ºf with no post cure bmi1 requires a minimum pressure of about 15 psig to cure voidfree 
bmi1 powder is advanced to a higher viscosity than standard bmi1 so that the powder is stable and not tacky at room temperature it has a viscosity at 275ºf of about 2000 cps 
bmi2 is a catalyzed version of bmi1 with similar handling and viscosity characteristics it becomes significantly reactive at 230ºf at 275ºf the viscosity is typically 35 cps bmi2 is high flow resin but 
because it is more reactive than bmi1 it has significantly less flow capability it can be cured at 325ºf without pressure to make voidfree laminates bulk bmi2 resin should not be heated above 250ºf 
without continuous temperature monitoring due to the possibility of uncontrolled exotherm bulk resin is much more prone to exotherm than laminates that contain 60% inert fiber the hazards from an 
exotherm are low however because bmi2 will not begin to decompose until its temperature exceeds 800ºf but exotherm temperatures can exceed that 
gore tex membrane is a very stretchy white teflon film that is only a few thousandths of an inch thick similar to teflon pipe thread tape it is laminated to a polyester fabric with a fine weave to

a crosssection of the bagging scheme that is used for the powder infusion process is shown below bagging scheme for powder infusion process 1 	
place preform layup onto releasefilm covered tooling plate nonporous teflon impregnated fiberglass is a preferred release film carbon fiber in contact with aluminum tools should be avoided due to a 
galvanic reaction that generates hydrogen gas an fep or other film can alternatively be used to separate the laminate from an aluminum plate one may want to use a peel ply on bottom surface depending 
on the desired surface finish and if it will be used for bonding 2 	
place vacuumbag sealant tape around the preform leaving a gap of 1 2 to 1 between the tape and preform if a square edge is desired on the panel silicone rubber strips may be placed against the edge 
of the panel sealant tapes can offgas during cure and should not contact the panel 3 	
place peelply on top of the preform followed by the perforated armalon sheet this sheet acts as a flexible pressure plate to improve panel thickness uniformity excess resin stays above the sheet and 
is easy to remove 4 	
place two sheets of carbon paper over the perforated sheet the carbon paper is very thin but highly permeable so it allows resin to flow to all the perforations and prevents the perforations from 
being sealedof by the gore tex membrane above the resin the carbon paper is one inch smaller than the perforated sheet so that resin does not flow over the edge of the sheet and sealoff paths to 
remove the residual lowpressure air in the preform no vacuum is perfect  5 	
distribute the preweighed bmi powder on the carbon paper fairly evenly then sweep the powder in the center of the panel towards the edges the powdered resin melts first on the bag side away from 
the preform making the powder layer thinner in the center causes resin to flow though the perforations toward the center of the preform first the resinflow though the preform will be from the center 
toward the edges which helps to sweep residual air toward the edges 6 	
remove the backing paper from the sealant tape and place the gore tex membrane over the resin seal the membrane to the sealant tape so resin cannot leak through wrinkles the gore tex membrane is 
laminated to a woven fabric  the side with the woven texture should not be in contact with the resin 7 	
place sealant tape around the periphery of the tooling plate for the final vacuumbag 8 	
place breather material over the gore tex membrane within the bounds of the sealant tape 9 	
seal the vacuum bag in place with appropriate vacuum connections check for vacuum leaks this cure process is somewhat sensitive to the quality of the vacuum better vacuum means less residual air 
in the preform that can become trapped by joining flowfronts

vent vacuum resin packaging raptor resins supplies bmi resins as solid material in metal cans generally a one quart can will contain 2 lbs a gallon can will contain 8 lbs and a 5gallon can will contain 40 lbs making 
crushed resin 
solid resin may be removed from the can by crushing the resin this is best done with a section of metal pipe or round bar about one inch in diameter hammers or objects with corners and sharp edges can tear holes in 
the can the can of resin should be below 60ºf but can be at 0ºf or below simply strike the side of the sealed can hard enough to dent the can start near the top of the resin because the crushed resin needs space into 
which to move work around the can and downward until the desired amount or resin is crushed 
the resin can then be transferred to a plastic bag this method can remove almost all of the contents of the can with very little residue with suitable technique the transfer can be done with very little exposure of 
the cold resin to humid air once in the bag larger chunks of resin can be crushed further if needed this is best done with a flat plate so that the bag is properly supported and is less likely to be punctured the 
crushed resin should be kept below 60ºf until used condensation of moisture on the resin can be avoided by not opening the plastic bag until there are no signs of continuing condensation on the outside of the bag it 
may be helpful to wipeoff any previous condensation  of course condensation is highly dependent on ambient humidity melting resin in the can 
all resins are very poor conductors of heat but there are ways to melt them quickly belong 
one method is the heated follower plate pump this consists of a heated plate that is lowered into the top of the can which melts a thin layer of resin on contact the melted resin is drawn to the suction of a pump in 
the center of the plate this suction actually forces the plate to follow the level of melting resin in the can the hotplate usually has a seal or wiper to wipe the walls of the can free of any resin residue on cans 
smaller than 5gallons the lip of the can will need to be cutoff using a canopener this method of melting resin exposes the resin to the minimum amount of heat for the minimum amount of time resin in the can that is 
not used has not been exposed to any heat at all the disadvantage is that the equipment is expensive requires maintenance and cleaning and it may require more resin to prime the pump than is used in making the part 
ovens can be used to melt resins in cans only air circulating convection ovens with good air flow should be used for resin melting the goal is to pump heat as quickly as possible into the resin without over heating 
it this is very different from keeping contents at a uniformly controlled temperature which is what some ovens are designed for transferring quantities of heat requires high air flow or velocity so an oven with a 
strong blower is preferred higher air temp will increase melting rate but this is limited by the maximum resin temperature allowed 
melting resin in a can is very different than heating a block of metal metals are good conductors of heat so there will usually not be a great temperature difference between the surface and the center resins in 
comparison are poor conductors of heat and therefore warm very slowly when conduction is the main mechanism for heat transfer natural convection currents flowing inside the can are the main mechanism for heat 
transfer when melting bmi1 or bmi2 
for natural convection to occur the resin viscosity must not be too high natural convection starts at about 150ºf for bmi1 and bmi2 when a can of resin is placed in a 200ºf oven the outside layer of resin will 
quickly heatup and melt hot resin is lower in density than cold resin so the cold solid resin in the can sinks in the melted resin layer this process continues until the resin is completely melted but during most of 
this process there will be 200ºf resin at the top of the can and a cold solid shrinking lump of resin at the bottom of the can this shows how important it is to have very good air flow against the bottom surface of 
the can because this is where most of the heat transfer needs to occur the can should not be placed on the bottom of the oven or on a solid shelf cans in ovens should be kept sealed or at least covered because 
heating is not desired on the top surface just the prevention of heatloss also bmi resins react slowly with oxygen in the air 
a hotplate could also be used but for several reason this does not generally work well there is usually a gap between the plate and the can due to the bottom rim of the can which leads to poor heat transfer the sides 
of the can do not warm until long after the resin on the bottom is melted so the solid resin cannot sink to come into contact with the can bottom there are heat losses out the sides and top of the can 
pouring molten resin from a can may get very messy if the proper technique is not used aluminum foil can be used to make a disposable pouring spout on the lip of the can the foil should be wrapped over and under the 
inside lip of the can so it is held securely in place it should also extend partway down the outside of the can this prevents resin drips from running down the side of the can and keeps the lip of the can clean so 
that it can be easily resealed this technique also allows resin to be accurately and cleanly dispensed onto a balance to make preweighed resin plaques for preform impregnation remove the foil before the resin freezes 
or you will need to warm the can again to remove the foil 
often a thick coating of resin will remain in the can because it freezes before it can be drained out this can be broken loose and added to another can or the can may be drained completely in an oven cutting off the 
lip of the can with a can opener will allow more complete draining chapter 6 dynamic mechanical analysis 
61 introduction 
the transport behavior of two series of penetrants namely esters and alkanes in a polymeric adhesive has been investigated by means of mass uptake and infrared experiments basic structureproperty relationships 
between the molecular structure and chemical nature of a penetrant were derived it is seen from figure 11 that the structure of a penetrant strongly influences its transport and mechanical properties then it is 
necessary to relate both the chemical structure and transport properties of these penetrants to their effects on mechanical properties of a polymer 
chemical structure in this chapter the effects of transport on the dynamic mechanical relaxation of the r flex 410 polymeric adhesive are discussed the presence of a low molecular weight has been known to drastically 
affect the mechanical relaxation of a polymeric system accelerated testing procedures based upon principles of timetemperature superpositioning proposed by williams landel and ferry1 were devised to create 
doublyreduced master curves of the observed mechanical response the diffusion phenomenon was introduced via the creation of a diffusiontime shift factor this enabled the prediction of the dynamic mechanical response 
of the polymer as a function of temperature and exposure time to a penetrant based upon fundamental properties of both the penetrant molecule additional information regarding the molecular relaxation distribution and 
the effects of penetrant has also been discussed 
62 background 
dynamic mechanical analysis 
dynamic mechanical properties refer to the response of a material as it is subjected to a periodic force these properties may be expressed in terms of a dynamic modulus a dynamic loss modulus and a mechanical damping 
term typical values of dynamic moduli for polymers range from 1061012 dyne cm2 depending upon the type of polymer temperature and frequency 
for an applied stress varying sinusoidally with time a viscoelastic material will also respond with a sinusoidal strain for low amplitudes of stress the sinusoidal variation in time is usually described as a rate 
specified by the frequency f = hz   = rad sec  the strain of a viscoelastic body is out of phase with the stress applied by the phase angle d this phase lag is due to the excess time necessary for molecular motions 
and relaxations to occur dynamic stress s and strain e given as 
 1 
s =s o sin t +d  2 
e =eo sin t where  is the angular frequency using this notation stress can be divided into an inphase component so cosd and an outofphase component so sind and rewritten as  3 
s = so sin t cos d + so cos t sin d dividing stress by strain to yield a modulus and using the symbols e´ and e´´ for the inphase real and outofphase imaginary moduli yields  4 
s =eoe'sin t +eoecos t 
s o 	s o
 5 	
e' = cosd e= sindeo eo  6 
e =eo exp it s =soexp t +d i 
ss s
  oid o
 7 e == e = cosd+ i sind = e'+ie 
eeo eo 
equation 7 shows that the complex modulus obtained from a dynamic mechanical test consists of real and imaginary parts the real storage part describes the ability of the material to store potential 
energy and release it upon deformation the imaginary loss portion is associated with energy dissipation in the form of heat upon deformation the above equation is rewritten for shear modulus as 
 8 g  = g'+ig 
where g' is the storage modulus and g'' is the loss modulus the phase angle d is given by 
g 
 9 tand= 
g' 
the storage modulus is often times associated with stiffness of a material and is related to the young’s modulus e the dynamic loss modulus is often associated with internal friction and is sensitive 
to different kinds of molecular motions relaxation processes transitions morphology and other structural heterogeneities thus the dynamic properties provide information at the molecular level to 
understanding the polymer mechanical behavior timetemperature superposition 
due to the viscoelastic nature of polymeric materials the analysis of their longterm behavior is essential this has been the topic of many studies dealing with polymers234 for a viscoelastic polymer the 
modulus is known to be a function of time at a constant temperature the modulus is also a function of temperature at a constant time according to this timetemperature correspondence long term behavior 
of a polymer may be measured by two different means first experiments for extended periods of time can be carried out at a given temperature and the response measured directly this technique becomes 
increasingly time consuming due to the long response times of many polymers the second method takes advantage of the principles of timetemperature correspondence wherein experiments are performed over a 
short time frame at a given temperature and then repeated over the same time frame at another temperature the two methods are equivalent according to the principles of timetemperature superpositioning 
these principles for studying longterm behavior of polymers have been well established by williams landel and ferry1 and have been eloquently explained and demonstrated by aklonis and macknight5 the 
methods of timetemperature superpositioning ie reduced variables are used to accelerate the mechanism of a relaxation or molecular event by either increasing the temperature or increasing the stress 
in the experiment a classic example of such a procedure is given below3 where the stress relaxation modulus from a tensile test is plotted as a function of time over an accessible time scale for various 
temperatures a reference temperature of to=25°c was selected and the modulusversustime curves for the remaining isotherms were horizontally shifted towards this reference until an exact superposition 
is accomplished 
shifting of each isothermal curve results in a much larger smooth continuous curve known as a master curve it can be seen that this procedure results in a dramatic increase in the range of the time 
scale the inset below is known as the shift factor plot the shift factor at represents the magnitude of shifting along the xaxis necessary for a specific isotherm to superimpose on its neighbor in the 
final master curve with respect to a given reference temperature the log at versus temperature plot should be a smooth monotonic curve provided the mechanism of relaxation remains the same during the 
process an inflection in the shift factor plot would be indicative of a change in the mechanism of the process thus invalidating the procedure the actual graphical procedure can be mathematically 
described for a shifted isotherm t1 as 
 10 e to t = e t1 
t 
a
t 
this implies that the effect of changing temperature is the same as multiplying the time scale by a factor at ie an additive factor to the log timescale 
the criteria for the application of timetemperature superpositioning have been described in detail in ferry’s text4 the first criterion is that all adjacent curves should overlap over a reasonable 
number of data points the second criterion is that the same values of the shift factor must translate all of the viscoelastic functions finally the shift factor must follow one of the wellestablished 
relationships the shift factor is usually described either by the wlf equation or the arrhenius relationship the wlf equation named after its founders williams landel and ferry1 is described as 
 c t t 
 11 	log a = 1 g tc2 + t tg 
and is associated with the transition plateau and terminal regions of the time scale the constants c1 and c2 are material dependent parameters that have been associated with fractional free volume 
nd the empirical doolittle expression and are defined as b 2303 fg and fg af respectively the values of c1=174 and c2=516°k were originally thought to be universal and are still widely used5 the 
glassy region of a polymer is accurately described by the second form of the shift factor namely the arrhenius form eq 12 where 
e = activation energy kj mole 
r= gas constant 
t= temperature °k 
tref =reference temperature °k  
e  11

povolo and fontelos6 proposed a very rigorous approach to determine whether or not ttsp is applicable to a set of experimental data by analyzing their relation to each by a scaling method it was 
shown through examples how superpositioning of curves seemed apparent when in reality the experimental curves did not lead to a scalar relationship 
methods of accelerated testing may be applied to any variable that accelerates the process without changing the mechanism of the process being measured some common variables are temperature frequency 
rate humidity filler content ph and chemical polarity 
the use of multiple shifting variables such as temperature and composition may also be used to create a doublyreduced master curve as in the previous descriptions it is necessary that the variables do 
not alter the mechanism of the process monitored it is also imperative that the variables of interest are additive only and are independent of each other 
multivariable shifting has been utilized in the evaluation of stressstrain data for a butadiene elastomer by changing temperature and filler content7 values of initial young’s moduli and of the ultimate 
propertiesstress at break strain at break and the strain energy densitywere evaluated at different temperatures and strain rates and were all superimposed using the wlf equation with c1=886 and c2=1016 
and a reference temperature of –25°c a double reduction in variables was done using an analogous form of the wlf equation for filler volume fraction to create a single master curve this allowed the 
prediction of stressstrain behavior as a function of both temperature and filler content differences in the apparent activation energy terms obtained from shifting the initial modulus and from 
shifting the ultimate properties were assumed to be a measure of the interfacial strength between the polymer and filler surface this composite strength increased greatly as the filler content increased 
values of the initial moduli proved to be dependent only upon filler content since changes in filler particle size showed no effect however this generalization did not apply to the ultimate properties 
in which case dewetting occurred the extent of dewetting was greater for larger filler particles than for smaller ones 
a similar study was also performed by sumita et al8 on nylon 6 with varying contents of ultrafine fillers the yield stress was evaluated at different rates as a function of temperature and filler content 
temperature shift factors for both the neat and filled systems exhibited an arrhenius behavior with a transition coinciding with a crystal transition of nylon 6 doublyreduced master curves of yield 
stress were created for filler compositions ranging from 0% to 20% indicating that the effects of strain rate and filler content were interconvertable with regard to yield stress resulting values of 
yield stress were interpreted in terms of the dispersion strength theory to describe the effects of filler size and content 
another type of compositional shift factor was utilized in a study of semicrystalline poly vinyl alcohol and nylon 69 stress relaxation tests were performed in tension on both materials with different 
degrees of crystallinity over a range of temperature 22°c to 77°c and humidity log e t versus time curves could be shifted along the time axis using temperature and relative humidity as variables 
superposition of the variables was valid except for in the extremes of very high and low humidities and temperatures this study concluded that the application of timemoisture superposition was valid 
when temperature conditions were near those of the polymer transition region 
temperature and moisture were also used as shift variables in the analysis of low molecular weight poly vinyl acetate by emri and ravsek10 samples were tested in torsion at temperatures from 20°c to 
36°c and moisture contents of 0% to 3% water doubly reduced master curves demonstrated the application of timemoisture superposition of pvac for the conditions given 
kohan11 has also shown the temperaturehumidity equivalence for the yield stress of various nylons nylon6 66 610  temperatures were varied from –40°c to 100°c and humidity levels tested ranged from 0% 
to 100% each of the polymers showed similar trends in behavior with regard to temperature and humidity however the extent to which the relative humidity affected the yield stress varied from polymer 
to polymer for instance the properties of dry nylon610 were similar to those of nylon66 at 50% relative humidity unfortunately no interpretation of the different humidity dependencies was made in 
terms of the individual polymer structures 
a very indepth look at the application of reducedvariables to the composition of plasticizers within a polymer was undertaken by schausberger and ahrer12 the materials utilized in this study were 
two grades of polystyrene mw=385 kg mole  mw=2540 kg mole  two commercially available plasticizers dioctyl sebacate and dioctyl phthalate and one oligomericlike 12diphenylethane were incorporated 
into the polystyrene samples in compositions ranging from 0% to 25% weight frequencytemperature master curves of the dynamic shear storage and loss moduli were constructed for the two neat polymers 
with reference temperatures of 160°c and 180°c respectively additional frequencytemperature master curves were created for the polymers containing various compositions of plasticizer the magnitude 
of relaxation strength was shown to depend upon the square of the weight fraction of the plasticizer the wlf constant c1 exhibited a decrease with increasing plasticizer content while c2 increased 
with increasing plasticizer content the dynamic moduli curves of varying plasticizer concentrations could be superimposed on each other all curves were shifted along the log frequency axis to a 
reference curve of zero concentration and the number of log frequency units translated was designated as a concentration shift factor these concentration shift factors were observed to roughly follow 
a power law relationship with the weight fraction of plasticizer a more accurate description of the relationship between plasticizer concentration and the concentration shift factor was given by a 
generalized free volume model of fujita and kishimoto13 in which polymerdiluent interactions were ignored this model was extended to describe the effect of the plasticizer on decreasing the number 
average molecular weight of the system the use of shear geometry was very important in this analysis since any heterogeneity within the polymerdiluent system would be in a sense averaged out during 
the experiment furthermore the actual shear testing arrangement minimized the surface area through which a diluent could evaporate out of the sample using this procedure the loss of any diluent due 
to evaporation was observed to be negligible 
recent work by shepherd and wightman14 on a silicone adhesive sealant investigates the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the sealant peel fracture energy from a number of different 
substrates doubly reduced master curves were constructed allowing the prediction of crack growth rates as a function of fracture energy temperature and relative humidity of the silicone sealants 
the above discussion demonstrates the utility of multiple shifting variables based upon the principles of timetemperature superpositioning in a variety of applications the current study attempts to 
extend the concept of a compositional shift factor to incorporate the kinetic process of diffusion the concept of a diffusion time shift factor will be introduced to correlate the observed mechanical 
properties with the diffusion process this in conjunction with the temperature shift factor allows for prediction of the mechanical properties of the adhesive as a function of temperature and 
iffusion time simultaneously 
63 concept of distribution of relaxation times 
the concept of relaxation time as it applies to polymeric materials has been described in many texts5151640  typical response of a polymeric material can not be described accurately with a single 
relaxation time unlike that of a liquid material this inability to be described by a single relaxation time is a result of its viscoelastic nature and is one of the characteristics that give polymers 
their unique properties in order to demonstrate the concept of multiple relaxation times for polymers it is necessary to describe the development of this concept from the fundamental theories from 
which it originated mccrum et al40 and t park17 have both given a very thorough description of this development based upon their reviews two basic categories of models describing single and multiple 
relaxation times will be discussed below 
the most simple relaxation model is that described by debye via molecular modeling18 the time decaying function in the debye model is described by the following exponential 
 t 
 13 	f t = exp t  
where f t is the decay function and t is the single relaxation time based upon this model equations such as the one shown below may be derived to permit fitting of experimental data to evaluate the 
relaxation time t 
e   e 1
 14 	8= 
e s e8 1+ it 
where e  is the complex dielectric constant 
es = the relaxed dielectric constant and 
e8 = the unrelaxed dielectric constant 
in simple terms es and e8 can be described as the dielectric constants at very low and very high frequencies respectively their difference is directly ese8  is directly related to the relaxation 
strength the previous expressions of the debye model like many of the following empirical models were originally formulated for dielectric properties however in the current study the primary 
concern is the study of dynamic mechanical relaxations in a shearing mode of testing fortunately the development of relationships for dynamic mechanical relaxation parallels that of dielectric 
relaxation 40 so the mechanical analogue of equation 14 described above is given by 
g  g 1
 15 	8= 
gs g8 1+ it 
all ensuing relationships describing the development of relaxation models will be described in terms of shear moduli g  
this model is far from being able to accurately describe the broad relaxation range of polymers however as will be seen it forms the basis for other more accurate empirical models for describing the 
relaxation distribution 
advances in more accurately describing the relaxation distribution of polymers were made in the work of cole and cole19 these researchers described the response of a polymer to a stress in terms of 
multiple relaxation times the time decaying function for a multiple relaxation model was assumed to be a linear summation of the time decaying function for a single relaxation model equation 16  
t  
f t t  16 t a exp i
= i 
i where a ti is the fraction of a single relaxation time mechanism with relaxation time ti based upon the colecole model it has been shown1719 that the expression describing dynamic mechanical data may 
be written as 
g  g8 1
 17 = 1
g g 1+ it a 
s 8 o 
where to is considered as a central relaxation time about which all other relaxation times are distributed and a is a fitting parameter with limits of 0=a= 1 this equation reduces to the debye 
expression for a=0 as can be seen by comparison with equation 15  as the deviation from a single relaxation time model becomes greater a 1 the dispersion becomes broader than that for a single 
relaxation time but remains symmetrical about to=1 cole and cole19 proposed a method of graphically representing the effects of multiple relaxation times which now bears their name a colecole 
plot consists of constructing an argand diagram or complex plane plot in which g'' is plotted against g'’ the expression derived by them can be expressed as

this model represents a depressed semicircle whose center is below the abscissa as shown in figure 61 increasing deviation from a single relaxation time is represented by a depression of the 
semicircle values for to and a can be found experimentally using the following expressions

the colecole empirical equations describe dispersion and absorption curves as being symmetrical about the position to=1 however the behavior of real polymers is characterized by loss curves with a 
high frequency broadening modification of the colecole model was proposed by davidson and cole20 in order to encompass the skew in the colecole arcs incorporation of this concept resulted in the 
following empirical equations

the colecole and coledavidson models are empirical relationships that have been designed to fit experimental data by describing the symmetric and asymmetric relaxation time distributions 
both of them may be described as single parameter models havriliak and negami21 devised a two parameter empirical model that combined the concepts of both the colecole and coledavidson models

the hn expressions are the most versatile empirical relationships due to the existence of two fitting parameters therefore they have often been used to empirically fit dielectric 
data 172223 as well as dynamic mechanical data24 the dynamic mechanical loss moduli determined experimentally in the current study will be fit in the frequency domain using the hn 
formalism a program that has been written by park17 will be utilized for this purpose and is listed in appendix f of this text 
a time decaying function is mathematically very difficult to derive based upon the havriliaknegami expressions however a methodology proposed by boese and kremer22 involves the use of a 
fourier transform of the general expression for dynamic relaxation response as shown below252627

using equations 32 and 33  the time decaying function can be numerically evaluated from the modulus versus frequency data the functional form of the hn description has been 
used to evaluate the g''  term in equation 33  typical decay time functions evaluated in this manner are shown for the dielectric response of poly hydroxybutyrate 17 phb at different 
temperatures figure 63  in the current study time decaying functions for loss moduli versus frequency data have been evaluated using a program that is given in appendix g17 which is 
based upon the hn formalism 
the time decay function created using the hn parameters may be compared with the wellknown kohlrauschwilliamswatts kww function the kww function28 is an empirical function that can 
describe the nonexponential time decaying behavior of many relaxation processes it is described by the following expression 
 ß
 t  34 f t =exp1 t
 o 
 
where to is the time at which f t decays to 1 e and the exponent ß describes the breadth of the distribution in the limits of 0 =ß=1 it has been shown29 that as ß increases from 0 to 1 the 
distribution of relaxation times changes from a broad symmetric distribution to a sharp asymmetric one the kww decay function has become widely used to model many relaxation processes in 
polymers 303132 the ß term has been associated with a coupling parameter n=1ß describing the degree of intermolecular cooperativity associated with a relaxation process303133  
in the current study kww expression equation 34 has been fit to the time decay function created using the hn parameters to evaluate to and ß for the dynamic 
mechanical response observed experimentally fitting of equation 34 has been done using a nonlinear program detailed in appendix h17 
the concept of a mean relaxation time is a useful parameter that can describe and compare the average relaxation behavior of different materials it has been shown1734 that an expression for 
the mean relaxation time can be deduced from the kww expression as 
8 t ß  
 35 <t >= exp1 dt

which can be rewritten as the following gamma function 
t o  1 
 37 <t>= g  ßß
 
equation 37 is the expression that will be used for evaluating mean relaxation times <t> for each of the polymer dynamic mechanical experiments in the current study the mean relaxation 
times will be evaluated as a function of exposure time to different solvents together all of the parameters described above will be utilized to investigate the effects of solvent and exposure 
time on the relaxation behavior of the r flex 410 adhesive system particular attention will be paid to the ß parameter of the kww function to describe the changing cooperative nature of the 
relaxation process 
64 temperaturefrequency master curves as described earlier in this study the mechanical properties of the rogers r flex 410 adhesive have been tested dynamically using a sandwich shearing 
geometry this particular testing mode and geometry were chosen due to the low tg and poor structural rigidity of the material dynamic mechanical data at temperatures in increments of 3°c 
ranging from –65° to 280°c has been obtained a total of eight frequencies 01 03 13 1030 50 and 100 hz were swept at each temperature 
samples were exposed to the penetrants for various times ranging from 1 to 105 minutes at room temperature then they were weighed their thicknesses were measured and they were placed between 
the shear plates the plates were clamped intimately to the surface of the samples so as to insure contact and to minimize penetrant evaporation an excess of penetrant was also placed inside 
the testing chamber to lower the penetrant activity within the sample samples were quickly cooled down to 65°c and then heated to the final temperature of 280°c the transition of interest for 
the neat polymer was = 32°c and the boiling points of most penetrants were = 100°c thus the majority of penetrant remained within the sample as confirmed by measuring the penetrant mass at t 
> 50°c during the course of an actual experiment 
dynamic mechanical data was collected on these samples and their loss modulus g’’   was plotted as a function of log frequency  a representative plot for a polymer exposed to decane for 
05 minutes is shown in figure 64 this sample was designated as decane100k after the penetrant used and the time of exposure for purposes of brevity such a designation is used throughout

figure 64 dynamic loss moduli as a function of frequency for polymer sample exposed to decane penetrant for 105 minutes 
each experiment consisted of a data set of approximately 60 isothermal curves the concept of timetemperature superpositioning ttsp was used to create a frequencytemperature master curve for the sample 
each isotherm was shifted left or right along the log frequency axis relative to a reference isotherm in order to achieve maximum overlap of the data the reference isotherm was chosen as tref =50°c 
which is approximately the peak position of the middlemost frequency 3hz for the neat material shifting was done so as to ensure that each curve matched the slope of its immediate neighbor closest to 
the reference curve the number of log frequency units through which an isotherm was translated is termed as its temperatureshift factor and is designated as log at by convention shifts towards the 
right are designated as negative while those towards the left are positive shifts 
horizontal shifting essentially compensated for a change in the time scale of a process induced by changes in temperature it is known from the thermomechanical spectrum of polymers that a change in 
modulus coexists with a change in temperature and that thermal expansion decreases the amount of material per unit volume since modulus is defined per unit area deviations from purely horizontal 
shifting may be due to both of the above factors these deviations are manifested in the form of a vertical shift that involves translation of the isothermal curves along the modulusaxis it is often 
rectified by normalizing moduli by the changing density and temperature as535 
 38 e t1t    t1 t1 = e t2t at    t2 t2 
in the current study vertical shifting was used only when absolutely necessary and their magnitudes were very small as can be seen from a few examples in appendix 
k an example of the final master curve for a sample exposed to the penetrant decane for 105 minutes is shown in figure 65 the corresponding shift factor plot is given in figure 66 and shows a smooth 
transition with no discontinuities it follows the general shape expected from the theories of williams landel and ferry1 the low temperature tail of this plot exhibits an inflection due to the failure 
of ttsp at lower temperatures t = tg and not from any effects due to penetrant melting as shown in dsc scans also given in appendix k

figure 66 temperatureshift factor plot for polymeric adhesive exposed to decane for 105 minutes c1 and c2 values are 803 and 760 respectively 
188 in figure 65 the breadth of the loss modulus master curve indicates the broad spectrum of relaxation times due to the crosslinked nature of the polymer36 using frequencytemperature 
superpositioning the range of frequencies has now been expanded by a factor of at least 3 decades this enables a prediction of the material response at various frequencies usually unobtainable experimentally 
the data presented in figure 65 and figure 66 are representative of only one penetrant at one exposure time however the polymeric adhesive was exposed to each of the nine nalkane penetrants and 
each of the nine ester penetrants for up to six decades of time 100105 min  the master curves were constructed using frequencytemperature superpositioning for each of these penetrants and each 
of the exposure times it is not possible to show all these master curves in this text for purposes of brevity however a few typical master curves and their corresponding shift factor plots are 
shown in the following pages figure 67 through figure 620  
the general form for the wlf equation has been described earlier as 
 c1 t tg 
 39 log at = 
c2 + t tg 
comparison to the empirical doolittle equation and an assumption of a linear expansion of free volume above tg provides physical significance to the constants c1 and c2 c1 can be given by 
b 2303 fg and c2 by fg af where b is the doolittle constant and fg is the fractional free volume at tg thus c1 and c2 values can describe the state of a material in relation to its free 
volume so changes in free volume are reflective of changes at the molecular level c1 and c2 constants may be found experimentally using a linearized form of the wlf equation based upon this 
linearized form a plot of 1 
log at versus 1  ttref yields a yintercept equal to 1 c1 and a slope proportional to c2 c1  example plots of this analysis are given in appendix k and tables of all c1 and c2 values for each of 
the penetrants and exposure times are given in table 61 through table 618 the quality of the fits were excellent with statistical r2 values greater than 098 there is no clear trend in the values 
of c1 and c2 determined for each penetrant and exposure time this result may be due to the range of data selected for the wlf constant evaluation regression of the data was limited to the range 
between tref and tref+100°c due to the validity of the wlf equation in this temperature regime and the fact that gross deviations from wlf behavior were observed in the shift factor plots at 
temperatures far below tg 
one question that needs to be addressed results from the complex nature of the diffusion process itself during transport of a penetrant into a polymer film a timedependent gradient in 
concentration exists throughout the thickness of the film in this analysis all dynamic mechanical properties are assumed to be average values from the entire thickness of the films ie homogenous 
distribution of penetrant  this assumption is valid since the shear geometry of the test yields information resulting more from the entire thickness of the film also additional experiments were 
performed to see whether or not the observed mechanical response is affected by concentration gradients polymer films were exposed to different penetrants and exposure times they were then 
removed from the liquids and promptly sealed in airtight containers for various lengths of time up to one month for penetrant to equilibrate and become homogeneously distributed dynamic mechanical 
tests were then performed and results from the equilibrated and unequilibrated films corresponded extremely well as can be seen from some examples given in appendix k 
each set of experimental data superimposed very well to form a smooth master curve using temperature as the shift variable as mentioned earlier the magnitude of vertical shifting employed was very 
small the horizontal shift factor plots log at vs ttref also formed smooth functions of the wlf form each shift factor plot enables the prediction of the resulting master curve of the material

65 diffusiontime master curves 
in the previous sections the concept of frequencytemperature superpositioning was discussed this process has enabled the prediction of the material response over a huge range of frequency at a given 
reference temperature the assumption in constructing these master curves is that the mechanism of relaxation for the polyamide adhesive remains unchanged and that temperature changes only lead to changes 
in the rate of the relaxation thermorheologically simple  the next step of this study which will be discussed in this section is the extension of this concept to the transport process in the 
adhesive this is often very difficult due to the changing nature of the polymer with time during such a kinetic process this type of behavior is usually termed thermorheologically complex and has 
been discussed in detail in the text by aklonis5 the possibility of this behavior is well considered and will be discussed in detail with respect to this work later in this discussion 
for ease of discussion the effects of increased exposure time on the dynamic mechanical spectra with respect to only one of the penetrants out of the 18 penetrants studied will be discussed below it 
can be seen from figure 621 that an increase in exposure time to the penetrant decane from 102 to 105 minutes shifts the mechanical spectrum towards higher frequencies since higher frequencies are 
analogous to lower temperatures this effect can be interpreted in terms of depression of the tg to lower temperatures due to plasticization by the penetrant this is typically what is expected on the 
basis of free volume theories373839

figure 621 frequencytemperature master curves for exposure times of 102 and 105 minutes to decane penetrant 
the master curves for the two different exposure times shown in figure 621 exhibit similar shapes and appear as if they may be transposable this introduces the concept of a potential shift factor 
based upon exposure time to a penetrant 
using a method similar to mccrum read and williams40 multiple curves were normalized with respect to their relaxed and unrelaxed moduli the loss peaks were assumed to arise predominantly from the 
motions of the polymer itself this is a valid assumption for the system studied due to the fact that the penetrants used are poor solvents high  values  with relatively low solubilities this 
assumption enabled the normalization by gmax thereby creating a common scale for comparison of the various experiments this procedure has now become widely accepted and is extensively used by several 
researchers a good example is the study by ishida et al41 on poly vinyl acetate and poly vinyl benzoate  where this normalization has been utilized to create the master curves for the arelaxation of 
these materials 
for a given solvent each master curve representing a particular exposure time has been normalized to a common axis using the technique described above these normalized master curves for the penetrant 
decane are shown in figure 622 the normalized master curves of a few other penetrants representative of both the alkanes and the esters are given in figure 624 through figure 629 
then all the curves have been shifted with respect to an exposure diffusion time of 0 minutes to achieve maximum overlap the number of log frequency units by which each master curve was shifted is 
designated as a diffusiontime shift factor log adt the composite mastermaster curve resulting from the translation of all the diffusiontime master curves for decane shifted with respect to a 
reference time of 0 minutes is also shown in figure 622 the diffusiontime shift factors log adt calculated from figure 622 are plotted as a function of log exposure time in figure 623 the composite 
mastermaster curves corresponding to the previous examples are also shown in figure 624 through figure 629 
the diffusiontime shift factors log adt for the nalkane and ester penetrant series normalized with respect to their equilibrium diffusion times te are shown in figure 630 and figure 631 respectively 
it can be seen from these figures that all of the 40 or more diffusiontime shift factors within a penetrant series can be represented by a single curve this implies that the mechanism of polymer 
relaxation for each penetrant series is not altered by the presence of the penetrant

224 this result is consistent with the principles of timetemperature superposition that have been invoked in the construction of the doubly reduced master curves it also lends validity to the concept 
of a diffusiontime shift factor that has been introduced 
the shape of the curves in figure 630 and figure 631 closely resemble a sigmoidal statistical distribution this resemblance observed is especially good considering the difficult nature of the experiments 
the sigmoidal shape could possibly be related to the fact that diffusion processes are often modeled as being a result of statistical jumps via brownian motion42 
it was mentioned earlier that the mechanism of polymer relaxation is not altered by the presence of the penetrant while its rate is accelerated the presence of the penetrant causes the film to swell resulting 
in an increase in the free volume of the polymer matrix the effect of this free volume increase is to accelerate the rate of relaxation of the polymer this is analogous to the acceleration of the polymer 
relaxation by the temperature variable in the wlf theory43 
comparing the diffusiontime shift factor plots of the nalkanes and esters figure 630 and figure 631 respectively some major differences as a result of the ester functionality can be seen the magnitude of the 
ester shift factors approaches a higher value than that of the corresponding alkanes due to the increased solubility and plasticizing efficiency of the esters the slope of the linear portion for esters 
is also greater than that of the alkanes this is once again due to the higher diffusion rates and increased plasticizing efficiency of the ester penetrants the above two results can also be predicted based 
upon the results of the diffusion experiments that were discussed in the previous chapter those results showed that the diffusion coefficients and solubilities of the ester penetrants were larger than those 
of the corresponding nalkanes 
a double reduction in variables such as the one proposed allows for prediction of the dynamic mechanical response of the r flex 410 adhesive system as a function of temperature and exposure time to any 
of the penetrants studied however the utility of this procedure lies in relating the diffusiontime shift factor to the fundamentals of the diffusion process itself diffusion is a process in which the 
concentration of a penetrant in a polymer matrix increases as a function of time by nature of this process exposure time to a penetrant is related to its concentration via the diffusion coefficient 
therefore the diffusiontime shift factors log adt of the alkanes and esters can also be described as a function of concentration weight fraction  as shown in figure 632 and figure 633 respectively 
thus if the diffusion coefficient of either type of penetrant at a given temperature is known its concentrationtime profile may be generated for any geometry by solving the appropriate boundary 
conditions for fick’s second law such a concentrationtime profile enables the correlation of the composition of a penetrant at any given exposure time this composition in turn can be used to evaluate 
the diffusiontime shift factor log adt of the penetrant at that exposure time then a knowledge of log adt in conjunction with the frequencytemperature shift factor log at can be used to construct the 
final master curve accounting for the effects of both temperature and diffusion 4

661 evaluation of hn and kww parameters 
in order to gain a deeper insight into the effects of the diffusion of the nalkane and ester penetrants the dynamic mechanical loss spectra were analyzed in greater detail segmental polymer 
relaxations occurring near the glass transition temperature typically involve localized motions of several backbone segments thus the shape of the viscoelastic dispersion is expected to be 
reflective of local molecular structure33 currently only a few studies are known that have attempted to relate characteristics of the relaxation dispersion to chemical structure in all of these 
studies changes in the 
chemical structure were induced by modifying the backbone of the polymer however in the current study the backbone structure of the polymer investigated has been kept unchanged instead the local 
environment of the polymer segments has been modified by the introduction of small molecular weight penetrants changes in the dispersion of the mechanical loss modulus spectra have been analyzed 
in terms of the ß parameter 
from the kww expression equ 34  the effects of penetrant absorption have also been investigated with respect to relaxation times and mean relaxation times of the polymer 
using the procedure described in section 63 the dynamic loss moduli data of each frequencytemperature master curve corresponding to a particular penetrant and exposure time has been fit to the havriliaknegami 
model of equation 26  the hn model parameters have been calculated from those fits 
using the havriliaknegami fitting parameters the timedecaying function f t  autocorrelation function for each penetrant has also been evaluated the autocorrelation functions for the polymer at different 
exposure times to heptadecane hpd is shown as an example in figure 634 these functions describe the relaxation process of the polymer as a function of time the slopes of these functions are a measure of the 
relative rates of relaxation with reference to the inflection point it can be seen that the relaxation times become shorter as the penetrant exposure time increases the autocorrelation function f t  of 
each polymerpenetrant system has been fit to the wellknown kohlrauschwilliamswatts kww time decay function equ 34 to yield the ß parameter and to presently described as the kww relaxation time quality of 
the fits was excellent with chi2 values ranging from 005 to 0003 in addition the gamma function described earlier equ 37 has been utilized to evaluate a mean relaxation time <t> for each system these 
parameters will be discussed in more detail later 15 10 5 0 5 10 log time sec 
figure 634 autocorrelation decay functions f t  for polymerpenetrant system of heptadecane at various exposure times 662 kww beta parameter 
the ßterm in the kww stretchedexponential characterizes the degree of nonexponentiality of the relaxation function the kww ßterm has been physically interpreted by many researchers30314445 as a 
description of the extent of molecular coupling within a polymer mathematically the ßterm is described as 
ß= 1 n 
where n is designated as a coupling parameter this coupling parameter n has been shown4633
 to be proportional to the strength of the constraints or interactions with nonbonded neighboring segments in the polymer in this discussion the kww ßparameter will be used however its relationship to 
the coupling parameter n has been considered 
the experimental ß values from the kww nonlinear fitting analysis for the nalkanes are shown in figure 635 there is a general decrease in the magnitude of ß as exposure time to the alkane penetrants 
increases due to the difficult nature of the experiments the data shows some scatter as a result general linear trendlines have been drawn to aid in the comparison of the different penetrants the order of 
magnitude ~02 of the evaluated beta parameters implies that the dispersion in relaxation distribution is very large these small values of ß result in large values for the coupling parameter n indicating 
that the polymer segmental relaxations require a high degree of cooperativity 
this interpretation is similar to that of a fragile material as described by angell47 similar values of n have been calculated for the highly cooperative systems such as poly vinyl chloride 44 epon 
1004 epoxy resin44 and poly vinyl methyl ether polystyrene blends30 the decrease in ß observed in figure 635 is a result of the greater variations of local molecular environments45 of the polymer 
with time as penetrant molecules become increasingly dispersed within the polymer sample the distribution of penetrant molecules results in a spectrum of different local environments around individual 
polymer segments thus the distribution of relaxation times can increase regardless of whether or not the relaxation mechanism is the same 
as the size of the alkane penetrant decreases the magnitude of ß also decreases the larger decrease in ß for the smaller molecular weight penetrants is attributed to the higher degree of solubility 
of the smaller molecular weight penetrants this in turn results in a higher composition of the penetrant which further disperses itself amongst the different polymer segments creating a broader array 
of relaxing units the larger molecular weight penetrants exhibit very little statistical change from the typical values of ß˜ 027 for the neat polymer adhesive from the above discussion it can be seen 
that although the values of ß exhibit a slight decrease with increasing exposure time and decreasing penetrant size this decrease is not very significant 030 – 014  therefore the possibility that a 
change in relaxation mechanism could occur during the diffusion process is highly unlikely 
in the following paragraph the kww ßparameters obtained from the curve fitting of the ester penetrants will be discussed figure 636 shows a plot of ß as a function of log exposure time for the ester 
series for the larger molecular weight esters the values of ß decrease with increasing exposure time as was observed with the nalkanes however as the ester penetrants become more soluble the values of 
ß increase with exposure time which can be interpreted as a decrease in cooperativity 0123456 log time min

the fact that the slopes of the lines become increasingly positive for the most soluble penetrants might be due to the fact that the higher degree of polarity results in a much higher degree of solubility 
the increase in polarity promotes better distribution of the smaller ester penetrants since the polymerpenetrant interactions are greater furthermore due to the higher levels of penetrant concentration 
the differences in solvent concentration between different areas of the polymer matrix are relatively less both of the above effects lead to an increase in uniformity of penetrant distribution as a result 
the distribution of relaxation times becomes narrower as the polymer segments now relax as similar cooperative units due to the greater uniformity in penetrant distribution 
as with the nalkanes the fact that the magnitudes of the ß values do not change significantly for the esters further supports the assumption that the polymer relaxation mechanism is not changing as a result 
of the transport process this assumption will be further supported by the behavior of the relaxation times for each polymerpenetrant system 
it is implicit in the coupling model of molecular relaxation304648 that timetemperature superpositioning is not valid for a system in which the ßparameter varies significantly the root of this implication lies 
in the fact that changes in the relaxation distribution are often associated with changes in the relaxation mechanism however the ßparameter itself has been shown to be highly sensitive to temperature49 proving 
that it is not always constant for a given system even though the relaxation mechanism remains unchanged 
the changes in ß observed in the current study are relatively small as described previously they are believed to result not from any changes in the relaxation mechanism but from changes in the time frames in 
which they occur throughout the polymer matrix furthermore this study is not a strict assessment of either the principles of timetemperature superpositioning ttsp or of the coupling model for relaxation thus 
the use of ttsp as an empirical method in the current study is valid and justified 663 molecular relaxation times in the previous section the kww ßparameter was discussed in detail with particular attention 
to the coupling model of relaxation a second kww parameter designated as the to also results from the nonlinear fitting procedure the kww to was described earlier as the time at which the time decaying function 
tdf decays to 1 e of its original value it is also designated as the apparent relaxation time in the following section this parameter to and the concept of a mean relaxation time <t> will be discussed 
the kww to and the mean relaxation time <t> for the nalkane series are plotted as a function of normalized time log t teq  in figure 637 and figure 638 the corresponding plots for the ester series are shown in 
figure 639 and figure 640 the behavior of the kww relaxation time to and that of the mean relaxation time <t> converge towards a single curve for all members of the nalkane series it may be recalled that this 
is very similar in shape and behavior to the diffusiontime shift factors log adt plotted versus normalized time log t te  this behavior indicates that each alkane penetrant affects the relaxation times of the 
polymer in a similar manner 
as for the nalkanes the exponential decay in relaxation times for the ester penetrants is shown in figure 639 and figure 640 as in the nalkane series all the ester penetrants converge towards a single 
function the normalized curves of figure 639 and figure 640 for the esters also follow the behavior of the normalized diffusiontime shift factor log adt plots described earlier in section 64 the relaxation 
times at equilibrium for the nalkanes and esters differ approximately by a factor of 2 this is the same difference that is observed between the diffusiontime shift factors at equilibrium for the esters 
and nalkanes this is expected since the diffusion of the penetrants alters the relaxation time of the polymer segments which is manifested as a variation in the dynamic mechanical response of the 
polymer 
the fact that the relaxation times for both the ester and alkane series each converge towards single functions fortifies the idea that the mechanism of relaxation remains unchanged throughout the transport 
processes the relaxation time analysis discussed above has enabled the evaluation of the parameters to and <t> that possess physical significance these parameters permit direct comparison of the effects 
of various penetrants as a function of exposure time they have also provided a clearer picture of the effects of the transport process on the relaxation of the polymer furthermore the behavior of the 
relaxation times and the discussion of the kww ßterm lend further support to the concept of the double reduction in temperature and diffusion time log adt proposed earlier section 64  3

67 summary in this chapter the concept of frequencytemperature superpositioning has been employed to create master curves of dynamic loss moduli versus frequency data temperature shift factor plots 
depicting the temperature dependence of the relaxation process were constructed from the master curves these temperature shift factors provided a means of predicting the viscoelastic response of the system 
under different conditions of frequency and temperature accelerated testing of this nature is based upon the premise that the mechanism of the relaxation process is unaffected by changes in temperature then 
the shifts associated with each isothermal curve is attributed to an increase or decrease in the rate of the process due to thermal changes 
comparison of the frequencytemperature master curves of various penetrants at corresponding exposure times led to the concept of a doublereduction in variables a newly developed shift factor designated as 
a diffusiontime shift factor log adt  has been incorporated to describe the transport phenomenon and the effects of a penetrant on the polymer relaxation process diffusiontime shift factors for both esters 
and alkanes increased as a function of log exposure time  the increasing values of log adt reflected the shifts in the relaxation spectra to higher frequencies ie lower temperatures  normalization of the 
time axis by the respective equilibrium diffusion times for each penetrant resulted in a single curve for each of the penetrant series this behavior fortified the idea that the mechanism of mechanical 
relaxation remained unchanged during the transport process for both the esters and nalkanes however the rate of relaxation varied depending upon the chemical structure of the penetrants 
this doublereduction in dynamic mechanical data resulted in the consolidation of over 50 individual master curves into two single curves one each for the nalkane and ester series of penetrants these single 
curves for the alkanes and esters differ slightly from each other due to the differences in diffusion rate and plasticizing efficiency between the two series 
empirical models such as the havriliaknegami and the kohlrauschwilliamswatts function have been directly fit to experimental data these models have been used in conjunction with one another to evaluate 
wellknown quantities from modulusfrequency data the concept of cooperativity has been investigated in view of the discussion on transport properties slight changes in the distribution of relaxation times 
have been attributed to the presence or absence of homogeneities in penetrant dispersion throughout the polymer matrix analysis of these distributions in terms of the kww tkww and the mean relaxation time < t > 
has provided a physical description of the effects of penetrant within a polymer matrix on the dynamic relaxation process values obtained for these t’s supported the assumption of an invariant relaxation
mechanism that was used in the doublereduction procedure thus the existence of the diffusing molecule only aided in accelerating this relaxation mechanism 
the temperaturefrequency shift factors in conjunction with the diffusiontime shift factors allowed for a means of predicting dynamic mechanical response as a function of two independent variables temperature 
and exposure time in the next chapter this ability is further expanded by incorporation of the concepts established in the diffusion study of chapter 4

thanks thanks thanks for this i just finished reading the documentation this is fantastic stuff  with the ever increasing complexity of microcomputers such as the cortex cores and 
systems manufacturers are providing development hardware and software systems based on c libraries to make using their chips easier such libraries reduce the requirement for chip documentation the 
conventional approach to providing support for development boards in forth has been to manually port the c library sources to forth the sockpuppet system takes a different approach by providing an interface 
solution between forth and c  the forth system calls the underlying c libraries in turn this allows the details of the hardware to be abstracted away by the c libraries whilst 
allowing the forth system to provide a powerful uniform and interactive user interface 
the mpe arm cortex forth crosscompiler supports calling functions in c or any language that can provide functions that use the aapcs calling convention this is an arm convention documented in 
ihi0042f_aapcspdf calls with a variable number of parameters varargs are not supported 
the example code in both forth and c is available for the professional versions of the arm cortex cross compiler the example code provides a simple gui for an stm32f429i discovery board using 
sample c code provided by st and others the interface is defined for cortexm cpus only if you need an arm32 interface contact mpe 
this work is directly inspired by robert sexton's sockpuppet interface 
sockpuppet 
his contribution and permission are gratefully acknowledged 
10 31 2016 1227 pm each function that is exported from the c world to the forth world appears as one of a number of types of call these words are called externs you can handcraft these words in 
assembler but the compiler includes code generators for several techniques the call format and return values match the aapcs standard used by arm c compilers 
there are several ways to call externs they have their pros and cons and are discussed in following sections 
svc calls you just need to know the svc numbers svc calls provide the greatest isolation between sections of code written in other languages the functions foreign to forth are accessed by svc 
calls and or jump tables the example solution uses svc calls for most foreign functions regardless of the primary call technique used all techniques rely on a small number of svc calls jump table 
the base address of the table can be set at run time eg by making a specific svc call the calling words fetch the runtime address from the table given an index double indirect call a primary jump 
table is at a fixed address and contains the addresses of secondary tables which hold the actual routine addresses the fixed address and both indices must be known at compile time this technique 
is used by ti's stellaris parts and some nxp parts to accesss driver code in rom direct calls to the address of the routine you need to know the address at compile time 
there is a practical limit of four arguments if you use svc calls for the insulation between forth and c if you want this limit changed call mpe! the other interface methods do not suffer from 
this limit 
it is a matter of convention between the forth and c code as to parameter passing order it can be changed by either side mpe convention is for the leftmost forth parameter to be passed in r0 this 
matches the aapcs code used by the hosted forth compilers such as vfx forth for arm linux we strongly suggest that you use the mpe convention in order to take advantage of future sockpuppet developments 
svc calls 
the examples use the mpe calling convention and are illustrated in assembler as well as by using the code generator 
svc 67 void bsp_lcd_drawcircle int x int y int r  \ svc 67 draw a circle of radius r at position xy  
code bsp_lcd_drawcircle \ x y r \ svc 67 draw a circle of radius r at position xy  mov r2 tos \ r ldr r1 [ psp ] # 4 \ y ldr r0 [ psp ] # 4 \ x svc # __sapi_bsp_lcd_drawcircle ldr tos [ psp ] # 4 \ 
restore tos nextendcode 2 of 14 
when the svc call occurs the cortex cpu stacks registers r0r3 r12 lr pc xpsr on the calling r13 stack with r0 at the lowest address the svc handler places the address of this frame in r0 r4 extracts the 
svc call number reloads the aapcs parameters from the frame and jumps to the appropriate c function in this case 
10 31 2016 1227 pm 
void bsp_lcd_drawcircle 
 uint16_t xpos uint16_t ypos uint16_t radius   
svc calls provide the highest insulation between forth and c but suffer from several issues 
the svc call mechanism is part of the cortex interrupt and exception system the assembler and or c side of this uses code written in assembler to allow the c routines called from a jump table to to be 
aapcs compliant the svc mechanism is inefficient compared to a direct aapcs handler because svc calls are part of the cpu interrupt mechanism you have to care how long a call takes playing games with 
cortex interrupt mechanism can fix this but is complex 
jump table 
in order to avoid the penalties of the svc call mechnism you can make an array of function pointers in c or assembler and call functions using an index into the table 
jumptable dd func0 dd func1    address of function 0  address of function 1 we still need to know the address of the jump table this is found using an svc call 15 and stored in a variable the jump table 
address could be hardcoded but given the horrors of perverting link map files and the like the overhead of a single svc call is preferable 
svc 15 void   getdirfntable void  \ define svc call that returns the address of the \ jump table variable jt \ addr \ holds the address of the jump tablejt holdsjumptable\ tell the cross compiler where the 
jump table address\ is held initjti \   initialise jump table callsgetdirfntable jt !   jti n int open const char   pathname int flags mode_t mode   if constructed in assembler the svc despatch table and 
the main jump table can be the same table  it's just a question of what you put in the table double indirect call tables 
before use you have to declare the base address of the primary rom table used for calling rom functions for luminary ti cpus this will probably be

where rom_apitable is an array of pointers located at 0x01000010 rom_gpiotable is an array of pointers located at rom_apitable[4] rom_gpiopinwrite is a function pointer located at rom_gpiotable[0] 
parameters 
ui32port is the base address of the gpio port ui8pins is the bitpacked representation of the pin s  ui8val is the value to write to the pin s  
description 
writes the corresponding bit values to the output pin s specified by ui8pins writing to a pin configured as an input 
pin has no effect the pin s are specified using a bitpacked byte where each bit that is set identifies the pin to be 
accessed and where bit 0 of the byte represents gpio port pin 0 bit 1 represents gpio port pin 1 and so on returns 
none to call this function use the forth form port pins val rom_gpiopinwrite direct calls 
where the address of the routine is known at the forth compile time you can use a direct call
 dir addr int foo int a char  b char c   
the forth word marshalls the parameters and calls the subroutine at target address addr the demonstration code provided here mostly uses svc calls to call the svc a small forth word puts the arguments 
into registers calls the svc and then returns a value if required svcs are identified by a number which corresponds here to an index into a a table 
the list must match the equivalents in the c code svc_syscall_table[] to ease sharing of data between the forth and c systems you can use the enum parser described in the interpreter directives chapter

observations of thermonuclear xray bursts from accreting neutron stars nss in lowmass xray binary systems can be used to constrain ns masses and radii most previous work of this type has set these 
constraints using planck function ts as a proxy both the models and the 
data are t with diluted blackbody functions to yield normalizations and temperatures which are then compared against each other here for the rst time we t atmosphere models of xray bursting nss 
directly to the observed spectra we present a hierarchical bayesian tting 
framework that uses stateoftheart xray bursting ns atmosphere models with realistic opacities and relativistic exact compton scattering kernels as a model for the surface emission we test our 
approach against synthetic data and nd that for data that are welldescribed 
by our model we can obtain robust radius mass distance and composition measurements we then apply our technique to rossi xray timing explorer observations of ve hardstate xray bursts from 4u 
1702429 our joint t to all ve bursts shows that the theoretical atmosphere 
models describe the data well but there are still some unmodeled features in the spectrum corresponding to a relative error of 1–5% of the energy ux after marginalizing over this intrinsic 
scatter we nd that at 68% credibility the circumferential radius of the ns in 4u 
1702429 is r = 124 ±04 km the gravitational mass is m = 19 ±03m8 the distance is 51 < d kpc < 62 and the hydrogen mass fraction is x < 009

the masses and radii of neutron stars nss encode valuable inparadijs et al 1990  lewin et al 1993  it was however only the

times nuclear saturation density and has strong isospin asymmeet al 2008  since then a large number of bursts from dierent 
try and which therefore cannot be analyzed in terrestrial laborasources have been put to use for recent reviews see miller & 
tories hence detailed measurements of ns masses and radii are lamb 2016  suleimanov et al 2016  there are currently two

equation of state eos of the matter ie the relation between mass m and the circumferential radius r from burst cooling tails

recent discussions  the reliability of such constraints depends 2016 and the cooling tail method eg suleimanov et al 2011a  
on the degree to which systematic errors can be controlled in poutanen et al 2014  nättilä et al 2016  suleimanov et al 2017  
many current analyses such errors are signicantly larger than both methods t the observed emission using planck function 
the formal statistical uncertainties  see miller 2013  miller & and then compare the evolution of the observed temperature 
lamb 2016  as well as on the precision of the astrophysical and normalization to the predictions of models see however 
models that are applied to the data 
ku´smierek et al 2011 for an early attempt to circumvent the one type of source that has attracted considerable attention usage of planck function ts only  these ts simplify model in this 
context is lowmass xray binaries lmxbs that exhibit comparison signicantly 
because the observed spectra are relfrequent thermonuclear xray bursts for reviews see lewin atively well described by thermal emission however because et al 1993  strohmayer & bildsten 2006  
by collecting obserneither model atmosphere spectra eg suleimanov et al 2012 
vations from these bursts and modeling how they cool down we nor the most accurately measured observed spectra miller et al 2011 are exactly planckian using planck ts as proxies throws away 
information and could even introduce biases 
here we present for the rst time simultaneous direct atmosphere model ts to a set of xray burst observations we begin by studying the constraints that can be obtained from synthetic data for 
which our model is a good description this allows us to assess the accuracy of 
our method and to explore possible biases in the results we then apply our method to data from ve hardstate bursts of 4u 1702429 we obtain interesting constraints on the mass and radius of this 
star and also study some of the previously neglected physical assumptions 
present in the tting procedures the lmxb system 4u 1702429 is a particularly good testbed for the tting as there has already been cooling tail modeling of the ve hardstate bursts from this source 
nättilä et al 2016  our initial analysis suggests that direct tting of 
detailed atmosphere models to data is a promising avenue for extracting neutron star masses and radii from xray burst data 
in sect 2 we present the theoretical basis for our analysis this section is split into two parts in sect 21 we describe how to model the emergent radiation and to couple it to the actual 
observations and in sect 22 we formulate the bayesian frame
work and present our hierarchical tting model we apply our model to synthetic data in sect 31 and then to real xray burst observations from 4u 1702429 in sect 32 in sect 32 we also present our new 
improved mass radius distance and composition constraints for the source 
in sect 4 we discuss our results finally we present our summary in sect 5 2 methods 
21 model for the emerging radiation 
suppose that radiation from a point on the surface of a ns is initially emitted with a local specic intensity i'at energy e'
e' 
as measured in the local frame of the emission assuming that the radiation propagates through vacuum to a distant observer that observer will detect this radiation at energy e where the energies are related by 
e 1 =  1 
e' 1 + z 
where z takes into account both the rotationinduced doppler shifts and the gravitational redshift in the limit of low spin frequency   0 the external spacetime is schwarzschild and there are no 
doppler shifts and therefore the net redshift approaches 
 1 2
2gm 
lim 1 + z =1  2 
0c2r
where g is the gravitational constant c is the speed of light and m and r are respectively the gravitational mass and the circumferential radius of the ns a distant observer will measure a specic 
monochromatic intensity ie that is related to the original specic intensity i' liouville’s theorem for photons see eg 
e' 
misner et al 1973  rybicki & lightman 1979 by 
 e 3
' fi'
ie = e' 3 
e
the total observed monochromatic ux from the star as seen by a distant observer is then see eg nättilä & pihajoki 2017 
 
fobs e =iedo 4 where do is the solid angle that the surface element occupies on the observer’s sky in this paper we consider a uniformly emitting slowly rotating ns in this limit the observed ux is 
related in a simple way to the ux f' emitted at the ns surface 
f' e' r8 f2 f' e' r f2 fobs e ==  5 
 1 + z 3d 1 + zd 
where r8 = r 1 + z is the apparent ns radius d is the distance 
p 1
to the source and f' e' = 2p ie'' µ µdµ where µ is the cosine 
0
of the angle between the local normal direction and the direction of emission of radiation 
in general a burster is not expected to emit uniformly and rotation rates of known bursters extend up to 620 hz muno et al 2002  watts 2012  rotation introduces doppler shifts that vary over the 
surface of the star and therefore smear sharp spectral features such as 
line these shifts also broaden continuum spectra but such broadening can usually be neglected nättilä & pihajoki 2017  moreover the assumption of uniform emis
sion combined with slow rotation means that the observed ux depends on the surface ux and distance but not the angular dependence of the specic intensity this is not true in more general situations we 
employ these approximations because they allow us to simplify the 
general equation 4 and avoid the usage of computationally costly ray tracing to combine the ux from dierent parts of the star they also allow us to neglect a few potentially important but often unknown 
parameters such as the ns rotation frequency and the observer’s 
inclination angle as well as the unknown latitude dependence of the ux 
the gravitational acceleration at the ns surface is given by 
gm 
g = 1 + z  6 
r2 
the shape of the emerging spectrum has a weak dependence on 
g the composition of the atmosphere also aects the spectrum via the energy dependence of the opacity  which includes contributions from both true absorption and scattering for example for an 
atmosphere with a hydrogen mass fraction x the thomson scattering opacity is 
1
t ˜ 02 1 + x cm2 g 7 
assuming the thomson opacity and a spherically symmetric ux the outward radiative acceleration balances the inward gravitational acceleration at the stellar surface when the stellar luminosity reaches 
the eddington luminosity ledd which is dened by 
4pgmc 
ledd = 1 + z  8 
t 
the actual critical luminosity is reached when the radiative acceleration 
r 
grad = f 9 
c 
equals the surface gravitational acceleration g here r is the ux mean opacity equal in our case to the rosseland mean opacity  
 
f =f' e' de' = ssbt 4 10 
e 
is the bolometric surface ux te is the eective temperature of radiation and ssb is the stefanboltzmann constant at high j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
temperatures close to the critical luminosity the opacity is dominated by compton scattering and is smaller than t because of the kleinnishina eect poutanen 2017  resulting in a critical luminosity 
exceeding ledd by 5–10% suleimanov et al 2012  we will use the ratio 
grad g to measure the escaping ux from the star 
using eq 8 we can also introduce the bolometric edding
ton ux 
ledd gc 
fedd == ssbt 4 =  11 
4pr2 edd t 
characterized by the corresponding eddington temperature tedd the corresponding observed eddington ux then can be obtained integrating eq 5 over energies 
fedd = a fedd = a ssbtedd4 8 12 
 1 + z 4 
where a = r8 d 2 is related to the apparent angular size of the star and tedd8 = tedd  1 + z is the redshifted eddington temperature 
for the ux escaping from the ns surface f' e' we will use the spectra from the atmosphere models computed in suleimanov et al 2011b 2012 and nättilä et al 2015  these calculations are based on the 
stellar modeling program atlas kurucz 1970 1993  but modied to deal with 
high temperatures ibragimov et al 2003  suleimanov & poutanen 2006  suleimanov & werner 2007 and to take into account compton scattering suleimanov et al 2012 using an exact relativistic redistribution 
function see eg poutanen & svensson 1996  the models are computed 
in hydrostatic equilibrium using local thermodynamic equilibrium and assuming a planeparallel atmosphere structure because of these approximations our model is only valid when the atmospheric scale height 
is much less than the stellar radius which means that grad g 
must be less than and not too close to unity 
here we limit our model spectra to the range grad g = 
02 098 to avoid any physical complications occurring at low or high temperatures at high temperatures the scale height is too large and at low temperatures relevant late in the burst tails it is likely 
that ongoing accretion breaks the assumption that the observed 
radiation emerges only from the passively cooling neutron star surface in practise limiting grad g to such a range implies focusing on the rst ~ 10 seconds of the cooling tail the compositions computed by 
suleimanov et al 2012 were pure hydrogen x = 1  pure helium x = 
0 y = 1  and solar hydrogentohelium ratio x = 0738 with dierent metallicities 001 01 03 and 10 of solar  here for simplicity we consider the atmospheres with a metallicity that is 001 of solar such a 
selection is possible and does not introduce a considerable error 
because metals will only aect the spectra at the very late stage of the burst when the atmosphere has a suciently low eective temperature suleimanov et al 2011b 2012  we on the other hand do not consider 
observations on such a late stage where this eect would play a 
role note also that exact selection of the metallicity does not play a key role here because we do not consider cold atmosphere models we use grad g > 02  for which photoionization edges start to dominate 
the spectral features in addition we consider surface gravities 
of log10 g = 140 143 and 146 with g is cgs units  
we use these models to obtain spectra with any given grad g log g and x by linearly interpolating or in the case of log g also linearly extrapolating the logarithm of the monochromatic uxes on the model 
photon energy grid the model parameter limits are grad g = 02098 
log g = 137149 and x = 01 we checked the accuracy of our interpolations by comparing our results against actual model spectra that were computed between the original grid points and found that the 
relative accuracy of the spectral energy ux was better than 1% 
of course what we observe is not energy ux but rather photon counts in energy channels we therefore convert our model spectra to photon counts by convolving them with a response function r i e of a 
detector 
8 
cmi = td m e r i e de 13 
0 
where m e is the photon number ux of the model at energy e and td is the observing time here the response function r is proportional to the probability that an incoming photon of energy e will be 
detected in channel i and is a discrete function ie a response matrix such that 
p ej 
r i e de 
ej1
rd i j =  14 ej ej1 
for an energy range ej1 to ej in addition one must take into account that the data might have a nonzero background in this case we t the observed background with some spectral model fbkg e  so 
that our total model photon ux at energy e is 
fbkg e fobs e 
m e =+  15 
ee 
the background ux is often estimated by observations prior to or after the burst but observational yu et al 1999  van paradijs & lewin 1986  kuulkers et al 2003  chen et al 2011  in’t zand et al 2011  
serino et al 2012  degenaar et al 2013  worpel et al 2013

lantyne & strohmayer 2004  ballantyne & everett 2005 sug
gests that the burst can increase or decrease the background rate and even change its spectrum thus background estimates from times near the burst are unreliable and use of them could introduce bias 
this is one reason that we focus on bursts that occur during the hard 
spectral state for such bursts the persistent background emission is very weak 1% of the peak ux  therefore although in practice we estimate the background using a 16 s observation prior the burst which 
we nd is described well by blackbody plus power law components 
bbodyrad and powerlaw in xspec  the background modeling is unimportant because the emission is dominated by the burst radiation results supporting this kind of static persistent emission treatment were also 
presented in kajava et al 2017c  where it is concluded that 
ven if the background emission varies during the burst it is unlikely to contribute more than 1% of the burst ux in the hard state in the soft state on the other hand one of the persistent 
emission components can brighten more than 10fold during the 
bursts kajava et al 2017a  finally we note that we multiply both the background and the theoretical burst spectra by an interstellar absorption model similar to phabs in xspec to account for 
the nonzero neutral hydrogen column depth 
22 hierarchical tting model for m and r constraints 
next we construct a framework for comparing the emission models to the actual observations of xray bursts in order to do this we formulate a hierarchical model for a ns that has been observed to 
have nb bursts bk where k = 1 nb we denote the set of all bursts as gb 
={bk}kn=b1 each of these bursts bk has ns spectra which we label as s jk one for each time bin j the
k ns 
set of all spectra in bk is similarly denoted as gs =sjkj=k 1
k 
each spectrum s jk consists of a set gc = nc jk with nc 
jk cdijki=1 jk measurements of counts cdi jk measured in the detector channel i for a single channel we can dene the likelihood function as l m i = p d|m h so that p d|m h is the probability of the 
data d given the model m and a set of assumptions h when the source of 
experimental noise is due to the number of events arriving at the detector the counting statistics are poisson distributed hence to estimate the model’s goodnessoft for one element cdi = cdi jk in some 
arbitrary burst bk and spectrum s jk we compute the likelihood for 
a poisson distributed data as 
cmi

the joint likelihood for a single spectrum is then 
 
ls m = p cdi imax |m h =li 17 
i=imin i 
where i ranges from the rst detector channel imin to the last detector channel imax used in the analysis note that because in practice likelihoods can be extremely large or small we instead use log 
likelihoods in our analysis the joint likelihood for a
o
burst is lb = sls and the total joint likelihood for all bursts
o
is l = blb 
in the limit of high count rate the poisson distribution is well approximated by a gaussian distribution in this case the likelihood is proportional to exp 2 2  where1 
 
 cdi cmi 2

because 2 is proportional to the log likelihood the joint log likelihood for the spectra in a burst and the joint log likelihood for all bursts is the sum of the individual 2 values we caution that 
particularly in the higherenergy channels it can be that there are not 
enough counts that the poisson distribution is wellapproximated by a gaussian in this case 2 is not a good approximation to the log likelihood and this could contribute to the formally poor 2 we nd 
in section 32 when we analyze data from 4u 1702429 
it is also possible that we have underestimated the uncertainties in our data in this case it is typical in a bayesian analysis to introduce an intrinsic scatter sint into the system physically the 
intrinsic scatter can be understood to originate either from the 
instrument calibration error or from the uncertainty in the actual model used which as we recall is interpolated from tabulated points in the space of composition surface gravity and temperature the 
addition of intrinsic scatter is similar to the error expansions in 
frequentist methods where data errors are increased until the total 2 dof is around unity the underlying idea is that intrinsic scatter acts to quantify and penalize our ignorance 
1 this is known as pearson’s weighting when the statistical error in the denominator is taken from the model similarly one could describe the error with the help of the data counts as is done with 
the neyman’s weighting both of them are biased in the opposite 
directions estimators of the model parameters see humphrey et al 2009  
of the model by increasing sint the possible credible regions for other parameters also inate to take into account that the data are not fully described by the model mathematically this is done by 
convolving the original gaussian distribution ns x where s can be taken 
to be v cm in relation to the 2 formulation  with another normal distribution with undened error sint it is standard to assume given no other knowledge that the errors can be added in quadrature s2 = 
s2 + s2  the likelihood in eq 16

1 1 cdi cmi 2 
ln li = const ln s2 + s2  20 
int

from this we see that the expression reduces to 2 when sint  0
w 
and s = cmi as the rst two terms in the likelihood expression can then be ignored as constants it is important to notice that sint cannot be increased innitely to get a better likelihood because the 
ln term in the loglikelihood expression compensates for the last term hence there exists some balance between the two terms and sint can only grow to some nite value where the previously unexplained 
scatter in the observations is then explained by the model 
the actual model spaces are then constructed hierarchically on top of dierent clusters of nested data groups such a model with nested hierarchy can be physically motivated by considering our problem at 
hand we have a neutron star that has some model parameters that can characterize it such as size distance   this neutron star will then exhibit bursts that could also have some model parameters such as 
composition ignition depth   the bursts however all share the same parameters that the neutron star has and hence in the model parameter hierarchy the burst parameters appear lower the bursts on the other 
hand are constructed of a series of snapshots in time that we call energy spectra again one individual spectrum could have parameters dedicated only to that one particular spectrum or share some parameters 
among the other spectra in the burst such a nesting of parameters we then call a hierarchical nested model in this paper 
in this work we consider four hierarchical models a b c and d presented in table 1 as an example we next go through the models in more detail at the top level of model awe dene 3 shared global parameters ns 
mass m radius r and distance d to the star the combination of m and r then gives us the surface gravity g and the redshift 1 + z these can be combined with the distance to give the quantity a which is 
proportional to the solid angle occupied by a ns on the sky in addition to these basic parameters we can set a global composition of the accreted matter via the hydrogen mass fraction x as is done in 
model b the next level in the model involves the dierent bursts bk gb for which we do not introduce any clusterspecic subparameters in this work going further in the hierarchy tree each spectrum of the 
burst s jk gs  bk has always at least one individual
k 
parameter to sample the eective temperature of the emerging spectrum as expressed through the parameter grad g in model c we also introduce the fraction s f that emits and we assume that j nättilä et al

model name global parameters burst parameters spectrum parameters assumptions 
gb gs k h 
model a m r d — grad g x = 0 s f = 1 model b m r d x — grad g s f = 1 model c m r d — grad g s f x = 0 model d m r d x sint — grad g s f = 1 
the emitting portion emits uniformly  s f is a free parameter that enters the ux equation by modifying the apparent angular size a' = s f a as we will see later on the real data are not fully described 
by the model to accommodate this deviation we in the end expand the model bby introducing a free intrinsic scatter to the system on the global scale we label this model d in contrast to models a to c for 
d we choose a nonuniform phenomenological distance prior  this choice is motivated by the synthetic data results intrinsic scatter is always when present sampled as ln s2  as it is a scale parameter in the 
model 
int
when a parameter is not free but has some xed value our model is said to have a set of physical assumptions h that implicitly enter the likelihood calculations the strictest set of assumptions h is 
imposed for model a which assumes constant uniform emitting area s f = 1 and known nonvarying chemical composition x = 0 or 073 in this work  in model b the assumption of the chemical composition is 
relaxed similarly in model c we test the validity of the constant emitting area assumption 
on a purely theoretical basis one would expect a model with every parameter dened as free in the lowest hierarchy level to be the least informative by allowing both the hydrogen fraction x and the surface 
fraction s f to evolve freely in time for each spectrum we could check the assumption of constant uniform emitting area and constancy of the chemical composition in practice such freedom in the model is not 
however possible as x and s f are strongly correlated because they both affect the normalization of the ux while composition does have a slight eect on the shape of the spectral energy distribution the 
current data do not allow any meaningful constraints without the additional normalization dependency these freedoms could be slightly limited by making the composition vary only from burst to burst this 
would then allow us to study the time evolution of the composition on much longer timescales from burst to burst another possibility would be to introduce a burstspecic s f term into the model to allow 
variations between bursts for example by a changing accretion disk inner radius 
finally we sample the parameter model space using bayesian inference we introduce uniform prior distributions for m and r in the range 1022 m8 and 816 km respectively for the distance a uniform prior is 
taken in between d = 2 10 kpc for the model d we choose to sample not vd but d3 2 corre
sponding to a weakly informative prior of d for the distance that slightly favors larger values such a selection seems to remove the otherwise strong preference for smaller masses2 we discuss this 
selection further in sect 31 when the hydrogen 
2 in our case asserting an informative distance prior leads to a at posterior in mass however this will most likely also aect physical observables such as the ux thus even though we appear unbiased 
in mass we are now biased in the ux because of this the aforementioned distance prior is only imposed for this one model to study the possible eects it might have fig 1 synthetic spectra crosses with 
corresponding bestt atmosphere models solid lines for a dierent colors show spectra for varying grad g individual spectra are shifted by factors of 2 in the ydirection for clarity 
mass fraction is not xed we assume a at prior ranging from 0 pure helium to 1 pure hydrogen  for the spectrumspecic nuisance parameters we take similarly uniform limits so that grad g = 02 098 and s 
f = 05 15 note that values of s f > 1 are also allowed as it might be possible that the apparent emitting area exceeds the one inferred from the star’s angular size a because of reection from the 
accretion disk lapidus & sunyaev 1985  we also do not impose any time relation in any of our models between neighboring time bins via adjacent grad g values every spectrum is free to attain any value 
in the prior range regardless of the adjacent spectra we then constrain the model parameters by sampling from the posterior distributions using markov chain monte carlo sampling to explore the parameter 
spaces we implement an aneinvariant ensemble sampler as discussed in goodman & weare 2010 see also guillot et al 2013  the actual implementation is heavily based on the bamr code steiner 2014a  which on 
turn relies on the o2scl library steiner 2014b  the ensemble sampler is similar to a normal metropolishastings algorithm but evolves not one but many parallel sample values called walkers together the random 
step for each walker is then done using a socalled stretch move algorithm where each walker makes a small step in the parameter space in relation to the whole ensemble acceptance is still performed using a 
metropolishastings scheme with correlated distributions this will improve the autocorrelation times of the chains tremendously allowing us to sample the parameter space more thoroughly in a shorter 
time 
fig 2 evolution of the normalized luminosity grad g for burst #1 of the synthetic data constraints on the surface fraction s f are also shown for model c which is the only one of our models in which this 
parameter is free the dotted black line with the scale on the right axis shows the corresponding standard deviation of the obtained parameter distributions the blue dashed line shows the input value used to 
create the data the darkness of the red coloring is proportional to the probability density this gure shows that when the tting model is consistent with the model used to produce the data we obtain parameter 
values that are accurate and precise 
3 analysis 
31 synthetic data 
we begin our analysis by applying the methods described above to synthetic data the mock data is created to resemble the observations from nasa’s rxte proportional counter array pca jahoda et al 2006  we 
produce data using r = 12 km m = 15 m8 d = 60 kpc and x = 0 these values are similar to those inferred from the ve bursts of 4u 1702429 that we analyze later see nättilä et al 2016  we also study similar ns 
con
gurations but with x = 073 which thus corresponds to solar composition to see how the composition aects the results the mock observations are created by computing the actual model spectra using the atmosphere 
models described in sect 21 in this process 20 spectra for each burst are created for 5 bursts in total so that grad g is linearly spaced between values of 02 and 
095 for each spectrum we convolve the model with an actual rxte pca response matrix compute the number of observed counts in each energy channel and then draw the observed number of counts from a poisson 
distribution centered around the real value for the background spectra we use the real background les from 4u 1702429 hard state bursts we increase the exposure time from 025 seconds to 05 seconds after 
10 time bins  this procedure is commonly used for real data to keep the signaltonoise level per time bin approximately constant despite the decreasing ux we x the neutral hydrogen column depth to nh = 187 
× 1022 cm2 which again is similar to that of 4u 1702429 worpel et al 2013  fig 1 shows a set of spectra from one such synthetic burst 
next we t this synthetic data with dierent models to assess how well we expect to constrain each model parameter this also gives us information about the possible biases in the method given that we know the 
input values of the parameters from here on when we discuss credible regions we will always be referring to the highest posterior density regions first we study how well we can get information about 
nuisance parameters such as the normalized gravity grad g and the fraction s f of the surface that emits fig 2 shows the evolution of these parameters note also that our other parameters such as m r and 
d are allowed to vary freely when the surface fraction is xed we obtain the correct grad g with a precision of about 002 in units of grad  as can be seen from the width of the 68% posterior distributions 
for models a and b if s f is taken to be free model c  the uncertainty in grad g increases by an order of magnitude although the input value is within the uncertainty region s f is determined with a 
precision of about 10% the lower precision for s f is because only the spectral shape rather than the amplitude is used to match the model to the data 
as a next step we consider the parameters of greatest interest fig 3 shows the marginalized parameter distributions for m r d and x when sampled along with the 2dimensional posterior space projections 
fig 4 shows the mr projection in more detail we see that model a is able to recover the correct radius r = 12 km with an accuracy of about 07 km after marginalization over all other parameters the mass 
on the other hand is always underestimated and shows a bimodal structure that is familiar from cooling tail ts suleimanov et al 2011a  poutanen et al 2014  nättilä et al 2016  suleimanov et al 2017  the 
input m r value is just at the boundary of the 95% credible region we determine the distance with a 68% scatter of about 06 kpc and no bias the sharp spike in the marginalized distance distribution near 
the maximum value originates from the solutions near the critical line where r = 4gm c2 mass and radius values on this line correspond to the solutions that are close to the maximum distance attainable 
for the system see eg appendix a of poutanen et al 2014 for more discussion  
when the hydrogen fraction x is a free parameter and the data are analyzed using model b we see that both the radius and the mass are now underestimated such an eect originates from the asymmetric x 
distribution which arises because the lower limit of x = 0 is set by physical assumptions for larger x we get smaller values of m and r than what we obtain using x = 0 in the m r plane our proper solution is 
now only inside the 95% credible regions of the posteriors due to the strong bias toward smaller masses for similar reasons the distance in this case is underestimated the hydrogen fraction is constrained to 
be x < 02 with 95% credibility 
when x = 073 there is a similar underestimation of the values of the parameters this is again caused by the connection between x d and m in this case the posterior for x is not symmetric around the true value 
because the distance has a maximum set by the observed ux level this causes x to favor larger values ie x > 073 and so the constraints on m and d are similar to the results from the model banalysis when x = 0 
ideally we would like the method to be free from any bias in m r d or x these parameters are not however our observables quantities closer to the observations include the redshift given in eq 2  which depends 
on m and r and the surface gravity g dened by eq 6  which is also a function of m and 
r the distance d and the hydrogen fraction x enter the system of equations via the ux eq 5  which in turn is limited by j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra fig 3 posterior distributions 
for the mcmc run with synthetic data for models a and b the top panels of the triangles show the marginalized parameter posteriors in arbitrary units   here the dark and light orange shadings give the 68% and 
95% credible regions the lower panels show the projected twodimensional parameter posteriors against each other for these panels the solid line encloses the 95% credible regions the blue stripes show the 
original values of the synthetic data which were used to create the data r = 12 km m = 15 m8 x = 0 and d = 6 kpc if the composition is known the radius is precisely recovered when x is a free parameter the 
prior limit of x > 0 and the correlation of m x and d with each other leads to asymmetric posteriors around the true value and so the inferred radius is a lower limit fig 4 mass and radius posteriors for 
synthetic data created for r = 12 km and m = 15 m8 which are shown here with cyan crosses the left panel shows a spectral t with xed emitting area s f = 1 and hydrogen mass fraction x = 0 model a  the right 
panel shows a spectral t with a free hydrogen fraction x model b  in both panels the dotted line encapsulates the 68% the dashed line the 95% and the solid line the 997% credible regions the dashed blue 
lines show values of constant redshift 1 + z = 12 and 13 the dotted orange lines are the contours of constant surface gravity log g = 140 143 and 146 the solid green line shows the critical radius r = 4gm 
c2 the dark orange region at the topleft corner marks the region of parameter space forbidden by the requirement of causality haensel et al 2007  lattimer & prakash 2007  the input m r point is within the 
95% credible regions in both cases even when the hydrogen mass fraction is a free parameter 
the eddington ux 12  what we observe directly is the num
ber of counts which is related to the photon number ux of the source by eq 13  because of this all of our parameters are interconnected in a complicated fashion in bayesian inference it is typical to study 
such a system by dening some information criterion and then to minimize its value given the t parameters this would then give us a description of the least informative often multidimensional priors we elect 
to instead impose simple unidimensional priors for the system based on experience with our analysis of synthetic data what we have found is that m x and d are the most tightly connected parameters in the 
system hence imposing a prior distribution for one of them will strongly aect the rest in this work we have decided to optimize our results for m and x at the cost of introducing a nonat prior for d based 
on our dierent test runs we concluded that a prior of p d  d1 2 which therefore slightly favors larger values of d produces the least biased constraints for m and x 
this leads us to propose a fourth and nal model model d which is an extension of model b in model dthe hydrogen fraction x is a free parameter but we also incorporate intrinsic scat
fig 5 posterior distributions for the mcmc run with synthetic data for the model d with helium and solar compositions the red solid line in 
v the d panel shows the prior distribution d that we used other symbols and legends are the same as in fig 3 with the inclusion of the weak distance prior we see that the t is better at 
recovering the original values if the hydrogen mass fraction is not exactly zero the true r m and x are recovered when a correct family of solutions is considered in many cases the incorrect 
highmass smallradius family of solutions is easy to discard on a physical basis as it is close to or inside the region ruled out by causality fig 6 mass and radius posteriors for synthetic data 
created for r = 12 km and m = 15 m8 which are shown here with cyan crosses the left panel shows the results for a pure helium composition x = 0  whereas the right panel shows the results for a 
solar composition x = 073  the symbols and legends are the same as in fig 4 even with a free hydrogen mass fraction x the true m r values are now more consistent with the 
constraints coming from the ts 
ter sint into the analysis and choose p d  d1 2 using these assumptions we recover the input parameters for the synthetic data without any signicant bias when x   0 this is evident in figs 
5 and 6 where we use model d with synthetic data that have x = 0 left hand panels of both gures and x = 073 right hand panels of both gures  we nd that when x is not exactly 0 we are able to 
reproduce the input radius without bias additionally if the second cluster of solutions at high masses is neglected we also reproduce the input mass hydrogen fraction and distance in practice 
this can be done by imposing a mass cuto of m < 20 m8 or by selecting only the lowmass solutions below the critical radius r = 4gm c2 for a pure helium atmosphere the sharp boundary at x = 0 
leads to asymmetric posteriors around the real value and so the estimates are always biased towards smaller or larger values an additional check is that the intrinsic scatter is driven toward 
small values which it must be because we created the data without any additional scatter 
for pure helium x = 0 model a we constrain the radius to be r = 113 ± 04 07 km at 68% 95% credibility the 
12+02 04 
mass is similarly constrained to be m = m8 thus 
02 02 
the input values are inside the 95% credible intervals the dis
54+03 07 
tance is found to be d = kpc the hydrogen mass 
04 05 
fraction is constrained to be x < 005 009  which is consistent with the input value x = 0 similarly for the synthetic j nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 120+07 11 22+01 01 
fraction results are r = km m = m8
09 21 07 10 
69+03 04 059+016 033 
d = kpc and x =  most importantly 
08 16 004 006 
we see that the correct radius is obtained without any bias if the second highmass cluster of solutions is omitted by asserting an 
120+06 10 
additional m < 2 m8 prior we obtain r = km m = 
09 22 15+04 04 69+04 04 059+015 031 
m8 d = kpc and x = 
03 04 10 16 005 007  
in this case both the radius and the mass are correctly recovered with 09 km and 04 m8 precision respectively even accounting for the mass imprecision when the composition is pure helium model d is 
still the best of our models in producing precise and unbiased estimates of the parameters 
32 4u 1702429 
we now study the rxte data from 4u 1702429 the bursts we use are from obsid 50025010100 80033010108 80033011904 80033012002 and 80033012100 starting at mjds of 51781333039 52957629763 53211964665 
53212794286 and 53311806086 respectively the data are reduced in a way similar to the reduction in galloway et al 2008 see also ka
java et al 2014  poutanen et al 2014  nättilä et al 2016  as we described in sect 31 we bin the data in time each time 
v 
the count rate decreases by a factor of approximately 2 we double the exposure time so that the number of counts in each bin remains relatively high the rxte data were also deadtime corrected see for 
example nättilä et al 2016  which was of course not necessary for the synthetic data one should also notice that unlike the synthetic data the real observations have a varying quality due to the varying 
number of pcus between the ve bursts ranging from 2 to 5 active pcus  some sample spectra from one of the bursts are shown in fig 7 we also show the evolution of each individual spectral 
parameter of each burst in fig 8 just as with the synthetic data we see that the normal
ized luminosity grad g is well constrained and the evolution of this parameter is strikingly similar to its evolution in the mock data in the model cts we see that the surface emitting fraction 
is constrained to be very close to unity for the entirety of this burst which provides some evidence that the full surface emits close to uniformly in this case 
fig 8 evolution of the normalized luminosity grad g for burst #1 from 4u 1702429 the surface fraction s f constraints are also shown for model c which is the only one of our models in which this 
parameter is free the dotted black line with the scale on the right axis shows the corresponding standard deviation of the obtained parameter distributions the strength of the red coloring is 
proportional to the probability density the constraints we nd using this real rxte data bear a clear similarity to the constraints from our synthetic data ts seen in fig 2 
as a nal test of our atmosphere model goodnessoft we can study possible systematic deviations from the model spectra in an individual energy channel level in fig 9 we show the ratio of the data 
and the bestt model ux from the model drun together with a channelspecic  value dened as dm  s ie dierence between data d and model m in units of standard error s for each of the ve analyzed 
bursts additionally table 2 shows the sum of 2 values for the bestt models there do not appear to be any signicant persistent structures in the residuals there is a slight decit of ux 
around 10 14 kev in the burst tails which corresponds to a ~ 5% dierence between the model and the data  ~ 04  no such features are seen in the synthetic data ts it is therefore possible 
that this decit has a physical origin we discuss these deviations further in sect 4 our total 2 for model d is 31035 with 2438 degrees of freedom reduced 2 of 127 for the set of all 5 bursts 
r 
when all spectral energy bins with counts less than 20 are ignored the quality of the t is however decreased drastically by the lowcount channels and if we instead select 50 as our channel 
count cuto we obtain 2 = 25410 with 2122 degrees of freedom 2 = 120 
r 
for our actual parameter constraints we consider only models a and d because model b produced somewhat biased constraints with synthetic data and model c has too much freedom in its 
parameters particularly with the inclusion of the surface emitting fraction sf as a free parameter  fig 10 shows the full posterior distributions and fig 11 shows the twodimensional m r 
posterior distributions in more detail for each model the precision of constraints is similar to what it was for the synthetic data we nd that r = 124 ± 04 06 km and

notes each column reports the total 2   dof and the value in the parentheses is the reduced 2r  for the 4u 1702429 the bestt values are 
m = 157 m8 r = 1217 km d = 547 kpc and x = 010 in the case of synthetic data we have m = 15 m8 r = 12 km d = 6 kpc and x = 0 
when computing the 2 values we require that the number of counts in each spectral energy bin exceeds 50 in contrast to the synthetic data the real bursts also have a nonzero intrinsic scatter of ln s2 = 32 
this corresponds to about 
int 
30 counts per second per energy channel in reality the intrinsic scatter accommodates more local deviations such as the ones between 10 14 kev as seen in fig 9 such an error in the observed counts reects 
a ~ 1 5% deviation from the model ux depending on the grad g value higher grad g corresponds to higher temperature ie larger count rate for which the deviation is closer to the 1% level whereas the opposite is 
true for a small grad g  
4 discussion 
the measurements we present here result from the use of full atmospheric spectral models of thermonuclear xray burst cooling rather than the usual use of diluted blackbody ts this gives us access to additional 
information via the surface redshift and the surface gravity our new method also allows us to validate many of the assumptions that underlie previous work for example we nd that the eddington limit is reached 
and exceeded near the beginning of the cooling tail see fig 8 that shows the t results for the rst burst in our sample  the remaining 4 bursts are almost identical  hence this is the most direct validation yet 
assuming that the atmosphere models are correct that at least the bursts that we analyze here are photospheric radius expansion bursts moreover the dependence of the spectral shape evolution on the atmosphere 
composition allows us for the rst time to set reliable limits on the hydrogen mass fraction in the photosphere this is made possible by the fact that the temperature evolution of the atmosphere is dependent on the 
composition 
41 uncertainties and systematic errors 
by tting the atmosphere models directly to the data we can also assess the degree to which the models represent the data although we reiterate our caveats about the use of 2 particularly for model comparisons see 
also andrae et al 2010  we note that the model d t to 4u 1702429 has 2 dof = 25410 2122 see also table 2  whereas for a simple blackbody t 2 dof = 27163 2010 the blackbody ts are obtained using xspec version 1291 
arnaud 1996 with bbodyrad model thus the model atmosphere t has an additional 112 degrees of freedom but its 2 is 1755 smaller this kind of comparison is however not strictly fair because individual blackbody bestts 
minimize the quoted 2 value for channels with more than 50 counts whereas the results from the hierarchical modeling are obtained from the mcmc chain that deals with full poisson or gaussian likelihoods the bestt 
values are also very susceptible to the exact energy range used for the t and so the 2 values reported here are only indicative when an extra 05% calibration error is introduced as is advised for rxte spectral 
analysis shaposhnikov et al 2012  the 2 value also decreases in both cases by about 30 the main dierence here that we want to emphasize is that blackbody ts involve two parameters per spectrum temperature and 
normalization whereas direct spec
v in figs 3 and 5 the red solid line in the d panel shows the prior distribution d that we used both models are seen to produce posterior shapes that are similar to what we found in our synthetic 
data ts fig 5  both models also produce consistent estimates for the radius and distance tral tting only has grad g as a parameter for each spectrum this is true for models a b and d  for model c 
the surface emitting fraction is also a free parameter for each spectrum  in addition to the individual spectrum parameters there are 3 to 5 global parameters and thus the total number of model 
parameters is 1 × 116 + [3 4] mass radius distance and hydrogen mass fraction in some cases  this means that when compared with the blackbody model the atmosphere model is able to reduce 
the number of parameters needed from ~ 230 to roughly 120 while retaining comparable accuracy 
nonetheless the formal statistical t is not good and this is reected in the nonzero value of sint in our model d ts hence it appears that there are unmodeled eects in the data an obvious candidate 
for such complications is the rotation of the star 
however because 4u 1702429 has a relatively small rotational frequency of 329 hz markwardt et al 1999  the eects are unlikely to be large for this star our preliminary studies show that the eect of 
rotational broadening of the spectrum is strongest at low and high energies and hence broadening might account for some of the deviations seen at e 3 kev and e >~ 12 kev in fig 9 the impact on the t 
quality ie 2  on the other hand is small because rotational broadening tends to smooth out the spectra without producing any sharp features nättilä & piha
joki 2017  hence disentangling the eects of rotation from the atmosphere model ts based on the t quality alone is hard 
as is the case for rotational smearing we cannot detect if there is nonuniform surface emission in the sense that the temperature varies across the surface this is because our model c j nättilä et al 
atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
which has a free surface emitting fraction s f can only capture eects where some part of the star is partially covered there have been detections of burst oscillations from 4u 1702429 that imply a 
nonuniform surface temperature markwardt et al 1999  galloway et al 2008  ootes et al 2017  however these have been detected only during the soft state bursts from this particular source ootes et al 
2017 and so it could be that the eect if it exists is small because it cannot be detected using rxte data 
another possible source of error is the treatment of heavy elements in the atmosphere nättilä et al 2015 showed that heavy elements can have a signicant impact on burst spectra most importantly heavy 
elements produce photoionization edges around e ~ 9 14 kev the metals are likely to originate from nuclear burning during the burst and might be brought to the surface layers of the star by convection 
weinberg et al 2006  malone et al 2011 2014  the spectral deviations are expected to appear mainly when the metals start to recombine at lower temperatures after the photosphere has cooled down the 
detection of such features in other sources with longer more energetic bursts in’t zand & weinberg 2010  kajava et al 2017b implies that they might also play some role in the shorter bursts analyzed here 
a third possible source of deviations involves the persistent nonburst emission which we currently assume to be constant during the t some recent studies indicate that this might not be the case even 
in the hard state ji et al 2015  degenaar et al 2016  kajava et al 2017c  however the initial level of per
sistent emission for the 5 bursts from 4u 170242 is very low and we expect this eect to not have a very signicant impact on the observed radiation a crude estimate can be obtained by varying the 
background emission not with the full hierarchical model but with individual blackbody ts in this case the constraints come from the eddington limit and from the normalization ktail = rbb[km] d10 2 
in the burst tail here rbb is the black body radius  r and d10 = d 10 kpc by varying the background emission with factors ranging from 05 to 2 we obtain constraints where the eddington ux is still 
accurately recovered but the apparent normalization in the tail is decreased or increased respectively the value of the normalization in the tail in this case is within 2% of the original value this 
is consistent with the fact that the persistent emission during the hard state is about 1% of the eddington ux whereas in the tail f ~ 05fedd and so a 2% scatter in the normalization k is expected as 
f = kt 4 the measured radius r scales roughly for the xed compactness as r  t 4 
edd8 ktail fedd see eg eq a9 in poutanen et al 2014 so such a deviation in the normalization results in a ~ 2% scatter in the radius this means that uncertainty related to the persistent emission would 
then translate to about 250 m absolute error in our measured radius 
the nal possible source of error is the neutral hydrogen column density it only aects the lowenergy channels of rxte which can have an impact on the parameters deduced late in the burst tail near the 
eddington limit the radiation peaks at e ~ 10 kev but when the ns cools down the bulk of the thermal radiation moves to lower energies hence the eect is similar to the aforementioned persistent emission 
where the main eect is on the normalization in the tail of the burst when the value of nh is decreased the modeled lowenergy radiation is aected less by the absorption and so the inferred value 
of the normalization in the tail also decreases because the model ux is now higher unfortunately it is also in the rayleighjeans tail that the surface gravity of the atmosphere models has the 
greatest eect on the emergent spectra similar considerations as in the persistent emission case show that varying nh by a factor of 2 leads to an error in ktail of 5% that then translates to 
similar relative error in radius we do however note that the measured nh is usually obtained by other instruments that operate at lower xray energies where it is easier to measure the neutral 
hydrogen column density hence an uncertainty of a factor of 2 is certainly overestimating the error related to the value 
our consideration of error sources leads us to propose that the emission above f   05fedd should be the cleanest option for m r measurements however the high ux near f ~ fedd is not free of 
problems early in the cooling tail the count rates from the source are highest and so the detector is aected by the deadtime correction the most deadtime correction near the peak can be as high as 5% 
which would directly translate to error in the measured fedd this would again translate to similar uncertainty in the radius in reality of course the deadtime correction scheme proposed by the instrument 
calibration team should be quite eective at covering this eect and so errors as large as 5% originating from this are not expected to be safe the uxes between 05095 fedd should give the most stringent 
constraints this however decreases the amount of available data even more and for example here in this work we pushed the aforementioned limits to cover grad g = 02 098 that we still think are viable 
another option would be to try to model the varying background emission and also marginalize over some plausible hydrogen column density range to capture all of the known error sources it 
would be useful to perform such an analysis in the future all in all this shows that we are approaching the absolute measuring accuracy of the rxte satellite 
the bestt results are also robust against any systematic calibration error in the ux normalization because the constraints for r mainly originate from fedd and ktail in contrast to the 
redshift 1 + z and surface gravity g which have a much weaker eect  the radius is mainly constrained by the temperature evolution of the burst only for an unknown systematic energyindependent 
shift  aecting the observed spectra we still obtain r  ktail fedd  ktail kt4  1 t 4  where tedd8 is
edd8 edd8
the eddington temperature see eq a9 in poutanen et al 2014 and eq 12  this is a distanceindependent quantity which makes the derived radius independent of any normalization factor  aecting the 
observed ux 
42 comparison and robustness of the constraints 
it is also interesting to compare our analysis of the 4u 1702429 bursts to previous constraints that were obtained using the cooling tail method by applying the cooling tail method to the same set of 
hardstate bursts that we analyze here nättilä et al 2016 measured the ns radius to be r ˜ 13 km for m = 15 m8 however their m r posteriors have a complicated bananalike shape see gure 4 in nättilä et al 
2016 and thus the in
ferred radius depends strongly on the assumed mass nättilä et al 2016 found that introducing priors on the eos leads to better constraints on the mass that is the assumption that all of the sources 
analyzed in nättilä et al 2016 in addition to 4u 1702429 they used 4u 1724307 and sax j181082609 originate from the same underlying eos helps pin down the mass they nd that at 68% probability m = 18 
± 03 m8 and r = 119 ±06 km assuming no phase transitions qmc+model a in their paper  these constraints are in a good agreement with the values derived here which from model d are m ˜ 19 m8 and r ˜ 124 
km the compositions are also in good agreement nättilä et al 2016 assumed a pure helium composition x = 0  whereas here the t itself shows that x < 009 68%  the distance constraints also agree well d = 
56 ± 09 kpc versus 55±04 kpc for the cooling tail and the direct spectral tting methods model a  respectively note that our m r results are located away from the critical radius r = 4gm c2 see özel & 
psaltis 2015 for discussion  if the constraints from fedd and a  ktail are not consistent with each other3 then the mr solution is forced to obey this relation because no real solution exists this 
could happen for example if the model is applied to data that it does not describe such as data from softstate bursts where the behaviour of the cooling tail might not be totally determined by the 
ns surface alone see steiner et al 2010  poutanen et al 2014  kajava et al 2014  nättilä et al 2016  
if the true values of m and r are close to the r = 4gm c2 relation then it is very hard to distinguish this correct solution from an incorrect solution that is forced upon the system by a model 
that is inconsistent with the data hence if all of the mr solutions from multiple sources are located only at this line seeözel et al 2016 for such a situation  it either means that the model is 
applied inconsistently to data that it does not describe or that all nss happen to have the same compactness m r = c2 4g 
another interesting aspect of our method is its ability to constrain the composition of the atmosphere as can be seen from the synthetic data ts it is possible to set limits for x with about 10% 
precision at 68% credibility this opens up a whole new window to the study of accretion physics because we can correlate the burst behavior against the composition of the accreted matter one should 
however note that the composition we probe here is the composition during the burst and so in theory the nuclear reprocessing might change the true composition during the measurement 
although x = 0 is still consistent with the data we can ask whether other aspects of the 4u 1702429 bursts are consistent with there being some hydrogen in the atmosphere one such consistency 
check involves the ratio of the uence of the persistent emission between bursts to the burst uence itself this ratio which is usually called a is a measure of the ratio of the gravitational specic 
energy release to the thermonuclear energy release  because hydrogen fusion releases much more energy than helium fusion we expect a to be larger when there is less hydrogen present for 4u 1702429 
a ˜ 75 galloway et al 2008  whereas for 4u 1820303 a is in the range 125–155 haberl et al 1987  the neutron star in 4u 1820303 is usually assumed to have a nearly pure helium atmosphere cumming 2003 
so the lower value of a in 4u 1702429 is consistent with the presence of some hydrogen in the latter source note however that the values of a quoted here are the minimum values and might change from 
burst to burst bursts from 4u 1820303 also exhibit a fast rise and have short timescales both of which are believed to be consequences of fast helium burning whereas the 4u 1702429 bursts have longer 
durations and also longer rise times galloway et al 2008  neither of these ndings is con
clusive but they do point into the same direction there should be some traces of hydrogen in the 4u 1702429 atmosphere as is suggested by our analysis 
3 together fedd and a set the normalization of the model spectra because both depend on the distance they both rely on the assumption that it is only the ns surface that is emitting if this assumption 
is invalid then the observed values might not coincide with the theoretical values 
43 future prospects 
it is interesting to consider additional possibilities that are suggested by our new and detailed analysis one obvious extension is to include the pre phase in our tting to do this however we will need 
accurate atmosphere models of extended ns photospheres the advantage would be to increase the available data for analysis and it should also signicantly improve the measurements of m and r because the 
expansion must be heavily dependent on the redshift z and surface gravity g preliminary work into this direction has already been reported in medin et al 2016  their work also allows an independent 
validation of our atmosphere models our results agree well with theirs in the range grad g ˜ 02 1 implying that at least in the context of the mutual assumptions set by both computations the results 
are reproducible 
another important but computationally very expensive future prospect is to t all possible xray bursts to obtain m r constraints this would help to set groundbreaking constraints on the eos of the dense 
matter preliminary studies already validate the previous results that the atmosphere models are not applicable to the soft state bursts poutanen et al 2014  kajava et al 2014  lastly it is also 
important to understand why the models do not agree completely with the data and the physical origin of these deviations for this more work is needed in order to understand the physics and 
environments of the bursts better 
despite the uncertainty about the mass we have improved signicantly the constraints on the compactness of the neutron star our mass and radius measurements are encouragingly consistent with 
recent theoretical analyses of the eos of cold dense matter lattimer & prakash 2016  such a result give hope on the possibility of using astrophysical neutron star measurements to constrain 
better the behavior of the ultradense matter 
5 summary 
we have presented the rst direct atmosphere model spectral ts to thermonuclear xray burst cooling tails our method is a generalization of previous work in which black body parameters were used as a 
proxy to trace the evolution of the energy spectrum by tting the atmosphere models directly to the data we are able to extract more information from the data and also to test some of the physical 
assumptions made in previous analyses 
we nd that ts to synthetic data which are generated using the same model that we employ for our analyses reveal as expected a lack of bias and also show the prospects for precise measurements of the 
mass and radius when we apply our tting procedure to rxte data from ve hardstate typei xray bursts from 4u 1702429 in sect 32 the resulting posteriors bear a clear similarity to the synthetic data 
although the formal quality of the ts is worse than in the ideal case when we articially add intrinsic noise in our analysis of the 4u 1702429 data to produce a formally good t we nd that the radius 
is constrained to be r = 124 ± 04 km at 68% credibility for both models we employ the source distance is constrained to be between 
51 kpc < d < 62 kpc 68% combined credibility limits from model a and d  we nd that the hydrogen mass fraction x for 4u 1702429 can be constrained to x < 009 at 68% credibility the highestprobability 
value is x = 006 rather than x = 0 
the mass seems to be the hardest parameter to constrain when we apply our two models to synthetic data model a typically underestimates m by ~ 01 m8 whereas model d shows even stronger underestimation 
for atmospheres with no hydroj nättilä et al atmosphere model ts of xray burst spectra 
gen in them when x > 0 model d is seen to reproduce the mass when applied to synthetic data our analysis of the rxte data for 4u 1702429 yields similar results model a gives m = 14 ± 02 m8 whereas model 
dgives m = 19 ± 03 m8 if a bias similar to what we nd when analyzing synthetic data applies to the 4u 1702429 analysis then the real mass is expected to lie closer to the model d constraints we 
suggest therefore that the 95% credible interval of model d is a trustworthy limit and in this limit we nd that the mass for 4u 1702429 lies in the range 14 < m m8 < 22
